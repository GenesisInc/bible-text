1 After this he departed from Athens and came to Corinth 2 And he found a Jew named Aquila a native of Pontus who had recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome So he went to them 3 and because he had the same trade he stayed at their home and worked with them for they were tentmakers by trade 4 He would give a talk in the synagogue every sabbath and would persuade Jews and Greeks
5 When now both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia Paul began to be intensely occupied with the word witnessing to the Jews to prove that Jesus is the Christ 6 But after they kept on opposing him and speaking abusively he shook out his garments and said to them Let your blood be on your own heads I am clean From now on I will go to people of the nations 7 So he transferred from there and went into the house of a man named Titius Justus a worshipper of God whose house adjoined the synagogue 8 But Crispus the presiding officer of the synagogue became a believer in the Lord along with all his household And many of the Corinthians who heard began to believe and be baptized 9 Moreover the Lord said to Paul in a vision by night Do not be afraid but keep on speaking and do not keep silent 10 for I am with you and no man will assault you to harm you for I have many people in this city 11 So he stayed there for a year and six months teaching the word of God among them
12 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia the Jews made a concerted attack against Paul and led him to the judgment seat 13 saying This man is persuading people to worship God in a way contrary to the law 14 But as Paul was about to speak Gallio said to the Jews If indeed it were some wrong or a serious crime O Jews it would be reasonable for me to hear you out patiently 15 But if it is controversies over speech and names and your own law you yourselves must see to it I do not wish to be a judge of these things 16 With that he drove them away from the judgment seat 17 So they all seized Sosthenes the presiding officer of the synagogue and began beating him in front of the judgment seat But Gallio would not get involved at all with these things
18 However after staying quite a few days longer Paul said good-bye to the brothers and sailed away for Syria accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila He had his hair clipped short in Cenchreae for he had made a vow 19 So they arrived at Ephesus and he left them there but he entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews 20 Although they kept requesting him to stay longer he would not consent 21 but said good-bye and told them I will return to you again if Jehovah is willing And he put out to sea from Ephesus 22 and came down to Caesarea And he went up and greeted the congregation and then went down to Antioch
23 After spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the country of Galatia and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples
24 Now a Jew named Apollos a native of Alexandria arrived in Ephesus he was an eloquent man who was well-versed in the Scriptures 25 This man had been instructed in the way of Jehovah and aglow with the spirit he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about Jesus but he was acquainted only with the baptism of John 26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him they took him into their company and explained the way of God more accurately to him 27 Further because he wanted to go across to Achaia the brothers wrote to the disciples urging them to receive him kindly So when he got there he greatly helped those who through Gods undeserved kindness had become believers 28 for publicly and with great intensity he thoroughly proved the Jews to be wrong showing them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ
