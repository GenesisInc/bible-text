1 Gather together yes gather yourselves O nation that feels no shame
 2 Before the decree takes effect Before the day passes by like chaff Before the burning anger of Jehovah comes upon you Before the day of Jehovahs anger comes upon you 3 Seek Jehovah all you meek ones of the earth Who observe his righteous decrees
Seek righteousness seek meekness
Probably you will be concealed on the day of Jehovahs anger
 4 For Gaza will be an abandoned city And Ashkelon will be desolated
Ashdod will be driven away in broad daylight And Ekron will be uprooted
 5 Woe to those who inhabit the seacoast the nation of Cherethites
The word of Jehovah is against you
O Canaan land of the Philistines I will destroy you So that there will be no inhabitant left
 6 And the seacoast will become pasture grounds With wells for shepherds and stone pens for sheep
 7 It will become a region for the remaining ones of the house of Judah There they will feed
In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down in the evening
For Jehovah their God will turn his attention to them And he will gather back their captives
 8 I have heard the reproach by Moab and the insults of the Ammonites Who have taunted my people and made boasts against their territory
 9 Therefore as surely as I am alive  declares Jehovah of armies the God of Israel Moab will become just like Sodom And the Ammonites like Gomorrah A place of nettles a salt pit and a permanent wasteland
The remaining ones of my people will plunder them And the remnant of my nation will dispossess them
10 This is what they will have instead of their pride Because they taunted and exalted themselves against the people of Jehovah of armies
11 Jehovah will be awe-inspiring against them For he will bring to nothing all the gods of the earth And all the islands of the nations will bow down to him Each one from its place
12 You Ethiopians will also be slain by my sword
13 He will stretch out his hand toward the north and destroy Assyria And he will make Nineveh desolate as dry as a desert
14 Herds will lie down within her all sorts of wild animals
Both pelican and porcupine will spend the night among her pillar capitals
A voice will sing in the window
There will be devastation at the threshold For he will expose the cedar panels
15 This is the proud city that was sitting in security That was saying in her heart I am the one and there is nobody else
How she has become an object of horror A place for the wild animals to lie down
Everyone passing by her will whistle and shake his fist
