1 These are the sons of Reuben Israels firstborn He was the firstborn but because he defiled the bed of his father his right as firstborn was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel so he was not enrolled genealogically for the right of the firstborn 2 Though Judah was superior to his brothers and from him came the one to be the leader the right as firstborn belonged to Joseph 3 The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were Hanoch Pallu Hezron and Carmi 4 The sons of Joel were Shemaiah his son Gog his son Shimei his son 5 Micah his son Reaiah his son Baal his son 6 and Beerah his son whom King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria took into exile he was a chieftain of the Reubenites 7 His brothers by their families in the genealogical enrollment by their descendants were as the head Jeiel Zechariah 8 and Bela son of Azaz son of Shema son of Joel who lived in Aroer and as far as Nebo and Baal-meon 9 To the east he settled as far as the beginning of the wilderness at the Euphrates River for their livestock had become numerous in the land of Gilead 10 In the days of Saul they waged war against the Hagrites who were defeated before them so they dwelled in their tents throughout all the territory east of Gilead
11 Now the descendants of Gad lived next to them in the land of Bashan as far as Salecah 12 Joel was the head Shapham the second and Janai and Shaphat in Bashan 13 And their brothers belonging to their paternal houses were Michael Meshullam Sheba Jorai Jacan Zia and Eber seven in all 14 These were the sons of Abihail son of Huri son of Jaroah son of Gilead son of Michael son of Jeshishai son of Jahdo son of Buz 15 Ahi son of Abdiel son of Guni was head of their paternal house 16 They lived in Gilead in Bashan and its dependent towns and in all the pastures of Sharon as far as they extended 17 They were all enrolled genealogically in the days of King Jotham of Judah and in the days of King Jeroboam of Israel
18 The Reubenites the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh had 44760 mighty warriors in their army who carried shields and swords and were armed with bows and they were trained in war 19 They waged war against the Hagrites Jetur Naphish and Nodab 20 And they were helped in fighting them so that the Hagrites and all who were with them were given into their hand for they called to God for help in the war and he responded to their entreaty because they trusted in him 21 They captured their livestock—50000 camels 250000 sheep and 2000 donkeys—as well as 100000 people 22 Many had fallen slain because the war was waged by the true God And they lived in their place until the time of the exile
23 The descendants of the half tribe of Manasseh lived in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon They were numerous 24 These were the heads of their paternal houses Epher Ishi Eliel Azriel Jeremiah Hodaviah and Jahdiel they were mighty warriors men of fame and heads of their paternal houses 25 But they acted unfaithfully toward the God of their forefathers and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land whom God had annihilated from before them 26 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of King Pul of Assyria that is King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria so that he took into exile those of the Reubenites the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh and brought them to Halah Habor Hara and the river Gozan where they are until this day
