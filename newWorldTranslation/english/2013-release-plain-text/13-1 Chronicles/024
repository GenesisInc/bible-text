1 Now the divisions of the descendants of Aaron were these The sons of Aaron were Nadab Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar 2 However Nadab and Abihu died before their father and they did not have any sons but Eleazar and Ithamar continued to serve as priests 3 David along with Zadok from the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech from the sons of Ithamar made divisions of them for the office of their service 4 Since the sons of Eleazar had more headmen than the sons of Ithamar had they divided them accordingly The sons of Eleazar had 16 as heads of their paternal houses and the sons of Ithamar had 8 as heads of their paternal houses
5 Further they divided them by lots the one group along with the other for there were chiefs of the holy place and chiefs of the true God from both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar 6 Then Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the secretary of the Levites recorded their names before the king the princes Zadok the priest Ahimelech the son of Abiathar and the heads of the paternal houses of the priests and of the Levites one paternal house being selected for Eleazar and one being selected for Ithamar
