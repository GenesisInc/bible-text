1 Then Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to number Israel 2 So David said to Joab and the chiefs of the people Go count Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan then report to me so that I may know their number 3 But Joab said May Jehovah multiply his people 100 times My lord the king are not all of them already servants of my lord Why does my lord want to do this Why should he become a cause of guilt to Israel
4 But the kings word prevailed over Joab So Joab went out and traveled throughout Israel after which he came to Jerusalem 5 Joab now gave to David the number of the people who were registered All Israel amounted to 1100000 men armed with swords and Judah 470000 men armed with swords 6 But Levi and Benjamin were not registered among them because the kings word was detestable to Joab
7 Now this was very displeasing to the true God so he struck Israel 8 David then said to the true God I have sinned greatly by doing this And now please forgive your servants error for I have acted very foolishly 9 Jehovah then spoke to Gad Davids visionary saying 10 Go and say to David This is what Jehovah says I am giving you three options Choose the one that I should bring on you 11 So Gad came in to David and said to him This is what Jehovah says Take your pick 12 whether there should be three years of famine or three months of being swept away by your adversaries while the sword of your enemies overtakes you or three days of the sword of Jehovah—pestilence in the land—with Jehovahs angel bringing destruction in all the territory of Israel Now consider what I should reply to the One who sent me 13 So David said to Gad It is very distressing to me Please let me fall into the hand of Jehovah for his mercy is very great but do not let me fall into the hand of man
14 Then Jehovah sent a pestilence on Israel so that 70000 people out of Israel fell 15 Moreover the true God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it but as he was about to do so Jehovah saw it and felt regret over the calamity and he said to the angel bringing destruction It is enough Now let your hand drop Jehovahs angel was standing close to the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite
16 When David raised his eyes he saw Jehovahs angel standing between the earth and the heavens with a drawn sword in his hand extended toward Jerusalem David and the elders covered with sackcloth at once threw themselves down with their faces to the ground 17 David said to the true God Was it not I who said to number the people I am the one who sinned and I am the one who did wrong but these sheep—what have they done O Jehovah my God let your hand please come against me and my fathers house but do not bring this scourge on your people
18 Jehovahs angel then told Gad to tell David to go up and erect an altar to Jehovah on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite 19 So David went up at the word of Gad which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah 20 Meanwhile Ornan turned around and saw the angel and his four sons who were with him hid themselves Now Ornan had been threshing wheat 21 When David came up to him Ornan looked and saw David and he immediately went out from the threshing floor and bowed down to David with his face to the ground 22 David said to Ornan Sell me the site of the threshing floor so that I may build an altar to Jehovah on it Sell it to me for the full price so that the scourge against the people may be halted 23 But Ornan said to David Take it as your own and let my lord the king do what seems good to him Here I am providing the cattle for burnt offerings and the threshing sledge for the wood and the wheat as a grain offering I give all of it
24 However King David said to Ornan No I must buy it for the full price because I will not take what is yours and give it to Jehovah or offer up burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing 25 So David gave Ornan 600 gold shekels by weight for the site 26 And David built an altar there to Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices and he called on Jehovah who now answered him with fire from the heavens on the altar of burnt offering 27 Then Jehovah ordered the angel to return his sword to its sheath 28 At that time when David saw that Jehovah had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite he continued to sacrifice there 29 However the tabernacle of Jehovah that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon 30 But David had not been able to go before it to consult God for he was terrified because of the sword of Jehovahs angel
