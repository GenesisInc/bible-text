1 Later Nahash the king of the Ammonites died and his son became king in his place 2 At that David said I will show loyal love toward Hanun the son of Nahash because his father showed loyal love toward me So David sent messengers to offer him comfort over the loss of his father But when Davids servants came into the land of the Ammonites to comfort Hanun 3 the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun Do you think that David is honoring your father by sending comforters to you Is it not to make a thorough search and to overthrow you and to spy out the land that his servants have come to you 4 So Hanun took the servants of David and shaved them and cut their garments in half at their buttocks and sent them away 5 When David was told about the men he at once sent others to meet them because the men had been deeply humiliated and the king told them Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back and then return
6 In time the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David so Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1000 silver talents to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia Aram-maacah and Zobah 7 Thus they hired 32000 chariots along with the king of Maacah and his people Then they came and camped before Medeba The Ammonites gathered together from their cities and came out for the battle
8 When David heard about it he sent Joab and the entire army including his mightiest warriors 9 And the Ammonites went out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of the city while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open field
10 When Joab saw that the battle charges were coming against him from the front and the rear he chose some of the best troops in Israel and drew them up in battle formation to meet the Syrians 11 He put the rest of the men under the command of his brother Abishai in order to draw them up in battle formation to meet the Ammonites 12 Then he said If the Syrians become too strong for me then you must come to my rescue but if the Ammonites become too strong for you I will rescue you 13 We must be strong and courageous for our people and for the cities of our God and Jehovah will do what is good in his eyes
14 Then Joab and his men advanced to meet the Syrians in battle and they fled from before him 15 When the Ammonites saw that the Syrians had fled they also fled from his brother Abishai and went into the city After that Joab came to Jerusalem
16 When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel they sent messengers to summon the Syrians in the region of the River with Shophach the chief of the army of Hadadezer leading them
17 When the report was made to David he immediately gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up in battle formation against them David drew up in battle formation to meet the Syrians and they fought against him 18 But the Syrians fled from Israel and David killed 7000 charioteers and 40000 foot soldiers of the Syrians and he put Shophach the chief of the army to death 19 When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel they promptly made peace with David and became his subjects and Syria did not want to help the Ammonites anymore
