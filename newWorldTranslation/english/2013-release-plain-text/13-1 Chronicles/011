1 In time all the Israelites gathered to David at Hebron and said Look We are your own bone and flesh 2 In times past while Saul was king you were the one who was leading Israel on its campaigns And Jehovah your God said to you You will shepherd my people Israel and you will become leader over my people Israel 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah Then they anointed David as king over Israel according to Jehovahs word through Samuel
4 Later David and all Israel set out for Jerusalem that is Jebus where the Jebusites were inhabiting the land 5 The inhabitants of Jebus taunted David You will never come in here However David captured the stronghold of Zion which is now the City of David 6 So David said Whoever is the first to strike the Jebusites will become chief and prince And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first and he became the chief 7 Then David took up residence in the stronghold That is why they called it the City of David 8 He began to build up the city all around from the Mound to the areas around it and Joab restored the rest of the city 9 Thus David became greater and greater and Jehovah of armies was with him
10 Now these are the heads of Davids mighty warriors who gave him strong support in his kingship together with all Israel to make him king according to Jehovahs word concerning Israel 11 This is the list of Davids mighty warriors Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite the head of the three He brandished his spear over 300 slain at one time 12 Next to him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite He was among the three mighty warriors 13 He was with David at Pas-dammim where the Philistines had gathered together for war Now there was a plot of land full of barley and the people had fled because of the Philistines 14 But he took his stand in the middle of the field and defended it and kept striking down the Philistines so that Jehovah brought about a great victory
15 Three of the 30 headmen went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam while a Philistine army was camped in the Valley of Rephaim 16 David was then in the stronghold and a garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem 17 Then David expressed his longing If only I could have a drink of the water from the cistern by the gate of Bethlehem 18 At that the three forced their way into the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the cistern by the gate of Bethlehem and brought it to David but David refused to drink it and poured it out to Jehovah 19 He said It is unthinkable on my part from the standpoint of my God to do this Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives For it was at the risk of their lives that they brought it So he refused to drink it These are the things that his three mighty warriors did
20 Abishai the brother of Joab became head of another three he brandished his spear over 300 slain and he had a reputation like the three 21 Of the other three he was more distinguished than two of them and he was their chief yet he did not attain to the rank of the first three
22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a courageous man who performed many exploits in Kabzeel He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab and he descended into a waterpit on a snowy day and killed a lion 23 He also struck down an Egyptian man of extraordinary sizeâ€”five cubits tall Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like the beam of loom workers he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptians hand and killed him with his own spear 24 These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did and he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors 25 Although he was distinguished even more than the thirty he did not attain to the rank of the three However David appointed him over his own bodyguard
26 The mighty warriors of the military forces were Asahel the brother of Joab Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem 27 Shammoth the Harorite Helez the Pelonite 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite Abi-ezer the Anathothite 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite Ilai the Ahohite 30 Maharai the Netophathite Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite 31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites Benaiah the Pirathonite 32 Hurai of the wadis of Gaash Abiel the Arbathite 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite Eliahba the Shaalbonite 34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite 35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite Eliphal the son of Ur 36 Hepher the Mecherathite Ahijah the Pelonite 37 Hezro the Carmelite Naarai the son of Ezbai 38 Joel the brother of Nathan Mibhar the son of Hagri 39 Zelek the Ammonite Naharai the Berothite the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah 40 Ira the Ithrite Gareb the Ithrite 41 Uriah the Hittite Zabad the son of Ahlai 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite a head of the Reubenites and 30 with him 43 Hanan the son of Maacah Joshaphat the Mithnite 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite 45 Jediael the son of Shimri and Joha his brother the Tizite 46 Eliel the Mahavite Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam and Ithmah the Moabite 47 Eliel Obed and Jaasiel the Mezobaite
