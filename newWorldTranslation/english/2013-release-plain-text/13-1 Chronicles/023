1 When David had grown old and was near the end of his life he made his son Solomon king over Israel 2 He then gathered all the princes of Israel the priests and the Levites 3 The Levites who were 30 years old and up were numbered their number their head count man by man was 38000 4 Of these 24000 served as supervisors over the work of Jehovahs house and there were 6000 officers and judges 5 and there were 4000 gatekeepers and 4000 gave praise to Jehovah on the instruments about which David said I made them for giving praise
6 Then David organized them into divisions according to the sons of Levi Gershon Kohath and Merari 7 Of the Gershonites were Ladan and Shimei 8 The sons of Ladan were Jehiel the headman Zetham and Joel three 9 The sons of Shimei were Shelomoth Haziel and Haran three These were the heads of the paternal houses for Ladan 10 And the sons of Shimei were Jahath Zina Jeush and Beriah These four were the sons of Shimei 11 Jahath was the head and Zizah the second But since Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons they were counted as one paternal house with one area of responsibility
12 The sons of Kohath were Amram Izhar Hebron and Uzziel four 13 The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses But Aaron was permanently set apart to sanctify the Most Holy he and his sons to offer sacrifices before Jehovah to minister to him and to pronounce blessings in his name always 14 As for Moses the man of the true God his sons were named among the tribe of the Levites 15 The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer 16 Of the sons of Gershom Shebuel was the head 17 Of the descendants of Eliezer Rehabiah was the head Eliezer did not have other sons but the sons of Rehabiah were very many 18 Of the sons of Izhar Shelomith was the headman 19 The sons of Hebron were Jeriah the head Amariah the second Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth 20 The sons of Uzziel were Micah the head and Isshiah the second
21 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish 22 Eleazar died but he had no sons only daughters So the sons of Kish their relatives took them as wives 23 The sons of Mushi were Mahli Eder and Jeremoth three
24 These were the sons of Levi according to their paternal houses the heads of the paternal houses by those registered who were counted and listed by their names and who carried out the work for the service of the house of Jehovah from 20 years old and up 25 For David had said Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest to his people and he will reside in Jerusalem forever 26 Also the Levites will not have to carry the tabernacle or any of its utensils for its service 27 For according to the last instructions of David the Levites from 20 years old and up were numbered 28 Their function was to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah to be in charge of the courtyards the dining rooms the purification of every holy thing and any work needed for the service of the house of the true God 29 They assisted with the layer bread the fine flour for the grain offering the wafers of unleavened bread the griddle cakes the mixed dough and all measures of quantity and size 30 They were to stand morning by morning to thank and praise Jehovah and likewise in the evening 31 They assisted whenever the burnt sacrifices were offered to Jehovah on the Sabbaths the new moons and during the festival seasons according to the number required by the rules concerning them doing so regularly before Jehovah 32 They also took care of their responsibilities toward the tent of meeting toward the holy place and toward their brothers the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah
