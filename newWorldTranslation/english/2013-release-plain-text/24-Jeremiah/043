1 When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all these words from Jehovah their God every single word that Jehovah their God had sent him to tell them 2 Azariah the son of Hoshaiah Johanan the son of Kareah and all the presumptuous men said to Jeremiah What you are saying is a lie Jehovah our God has not sent you to say Do not go to Egypt to reside there 3 But Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Chaldeans to put us to death or to take us into exile in Babylon
4 So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the army chiefs and all the people disobeyed the voice of Jehovah to remain in the land of Judah 5 Instead Johanan the son of Kareah and all the army chiefs took with them all the remnant of Judah who had returned to reside in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been dispersed 6 They took the men the women the children the daughters of the king and everyone whom Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan as well as Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah 7 And they went into the land of Egypt for they did not obey the voice of Jehovah and they went as far as Tahpanhes
8 Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes saying 9 Take in your hand large stones and hide them in the mortar in the brick terrace at the entrance of the house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes with the Jewish men looking on 10 Then say to them This is what Jehovah of armies the God of Israel says Here I am sending for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and I will place his throne right above these stones that I have hidden and he will extend his royal tent over them 11 And he will come in and strike the land of Egypt Whoever is meant for deadly plague will be for deadly plague and whoever is meant for captivity will be for captivity and whoever is meant for the sword will be for the sword 12 And I will set the houses of the gods of Egypt on fire and he will burn them and lead them captive He will wrap the land of Egypt around himself just as a shepherd wraps himself in his garment and he will depart from there in peace 13 And he will break to pieces the pillars of Beth-shemesh in the land of Egypt and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire
