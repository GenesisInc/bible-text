1 This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah when he wrote in a book these words dictated by Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah the king of Judah
2 This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says concerning you Baruch 3 You have said Woe to me for Jehovah has added grief to my pain I am weary from my groaning and I have found no resting-place
4 You should say to him This is what Jehovah says Look What I have built up I am tearing down and what I have planted I am uprooting—the entire land 5 But you are seeking great things for yourself Stop seeking such things
For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh  declares Jehovah and wherever you may go I will grant you your life as a spoil
