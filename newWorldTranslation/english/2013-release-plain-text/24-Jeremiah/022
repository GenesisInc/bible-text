1 This is what Jehovah says Go down to the house of the king of Judah and deliver this message 2 You must say Hear the word of Jehovah O king of Judah who sits on the throne of David you with your servants and your people those who enter through these gates 3 This is what Jehovah says Uphold justice and righteousness Rescue the one being robbed from the hand of the defrauder Do not mistreat any foreign resident and do not harm any fatherless child or widow And do not shed any innocent blood in this place 4 For if you are careful to carry out this word then the kings who sit on the throne of David will enter through the gates of this house riding in chariots and on horses they with their servants and their people
5 But if you will not obey these words by myself I do swear  declares Jehovah that this house will become a devastated place
6 For this is what Jehovah says concerning the house of the king of Judah You are as Gilead to me Like the summit of Lebanon
But I will make you a wilderness Not one of your cities will be inhabited
 7 And I will appoint destroyers against you Each with his weapons
They will cut down your choicest cedarsAnd make them fall into the fire
8 And many nations will pass by this city and say to one another Why did Jehovah do this to this great city 9 And they will reply Because they abandoned the covenant of Jehovah their God and bowed down to other gods and served them
10 Do not weep for the dead one And do not sympathize with him
Instead weep profusely for the one going away For he will return no more to see the land of his birth
11 For this is what Jehovah says concerning Shallum son of Josiah the king of Judah who is reigning instead of his father Josiah and who has gone out of this place He will return there no more 12 For he will die in the place where they have taken him into exile and he will see this land no more
13 Woe to the one who builds his house without righteousnessAnd his upper rooms without justice Who makes his fellow man serve him for nothing Whose wages he refuses to pay 14 The one saying I will build for myself a roomy houseWith spacious upper rooms
I will fit it with windowsAnd panel it with cedar and paint it with vermilion
15 Will you continue reigning because you outdo others in your use of cedar
Your father also ate and drank But he upheld justice and righteousness And it went well with him
16 He defended the legal claim of the afflicted one and the poor one So that it went well
Is that not what it means to know me declares Jehovah
17 But your eyes and heart are set only on your dishonest gain On shedding innocent blood And on committing fraud and extortion
18 Therefore this is what Jehovah says concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah the king of Judah They will not mourn him
Alas my brother Alas my sister
They will not mourn him
Alas O master Alas his majesty
19 With the burial of a donkey he will be buried Dragged about and thrown away Outside the gates of Jerusalem
20 Go up to Lebanon and cry out Raise your voice in Bashan And cry out from Abarim For all your passionate lovers have been crushed
21 I spoke to you when you felt secure
But you said I will not obey
This has been your course since youth For you have not obeyed my voice
22 A wind will shepherd all your shepherds And your passionate lovers will go into captivity
Then you will be put to shame and humiliated because of all your calamity
23 O you who dwell in Lebanon Nestled among the cedars How you will groan when pangs come on you Anguish like that of a woman giving birth
24 As surely as I am alive  declares Jehovah even if Coniah son of Jehoiakim the king of Judah were the seal ring on my right hand I would pull you off from there 25 I will give you into the hand of those seeking to take your life into the hand of those whom you fear into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans 26 And I will hurl you and your mother who gave birth to you into another land where you were not born and there you will die 27 And they will never return to the land they yearn for
28 Is this man Coniah just a despised broken pot A vessel that nobody wants
Why are he and his descendants hurled downAnd thrown into a land they do not know
29 O earth earth earth hear the word of Jehovah
30 This is what Jehovah says
Write down this man as childless As a man who will not have any success during his lifetime For none of his descendants will succeedIn sitting on Davids throne and ruling again in Judah
