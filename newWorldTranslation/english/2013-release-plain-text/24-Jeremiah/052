1 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned for 11 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah 2 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovahs eyes according to all that Jehoiakim had done 3 It was because of Jehovahs anger that these things took place in Jerusalem and in Judah until he cast them out of his sight And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon 4 In the ninth year of Zedekiahs reign in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem They camped against it and built a siege wall all around it 5 And the city was under siege until the 11th year of King Zedekiah
6 In the fourth month on the ninth day of the month the famine was severe in the city and there was no food for the people of the land 7 Finally the city wall was broken through and all the soldiers fled from the city by night through the gate between the double wall near the kings garden while the Chaldeans were surrounding the city and they continued by the way of the Arabah 8 But the Chaldean army pursued the king and they overtook Zedekiah in the desert plains of Jericho and all his troops were scattered from his side 9 Then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath and he passed sentence on him 10 And the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiahs sons before his eyes and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah there at Riblah 11 Then the king of Babylon blinded Zedekiahs eyes bound him with copper fetters brought him to Babylon and kept him imprisoned until the day of his death
12 In the fifth month on the tenth day of the month that is in the 19th year of King Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard who was an attendant of the king of Babylon came into Jerusalem 13 He burned down the house of Jehovah the kings house and all the houses of Jerusalem he also burned down every large house 14 And the walls surrounding Jerusalem were pulled down by the entire Chaldean army that was with the chief of the guard
15 Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took into exile some of the lowly people and the rest of the people who were left in the city He also took the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon as well as the rest of the master craftsmen 16 But Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard left some of the poorest people of the land to serve as vinedressers and as compulsory laborers
17 And the Chaldeans broke into pieces the copper pillars of the house of Jehovah and the carriages and the copper Sea that were in the house of Jehovah and they carried all the copper away to Babylon 18 They also took the cans the shovels the extinguishers the bowls the cups and all the copper utensils used in the temple service 19 The chief of the guard took the basins the fire holders the bowls the cans the lampstands the cups and the bowls that were of genuine gold and silver 20 As for the two pillars the Sea the 12 copper bulls under the Sea and the carriages that King Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah the copper of all these articles was beyond weighing
21 As for the pillars each pillar was 18 cubits high a measuring cord of 12 cubits could encircle it its thickness was four fingerbreadths and it was hollow 22 And the capital on it was of copper and the height of the one capital was five cubits and the network and pomegranates all around on the capital were all made of copper The second pillar was just like it also the pomegranates 23 There were 96 pomegranates on the sides in all there were 100 pomegranates around the network
24 The chief of the guard also took Seraiah the chief priest Zephaniah the second priest and the three doorkeepers 25 And he took from the city one court official who was the commissioner over the soldiers seven close associates of the king who were found in the city as well as the secretary of the chief of the army the one mustering the people of the land and 60 men of the common people of the land who were yet found in the city 26 Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah 27 The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath Thus Judah went into exile from its land
28 These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took into exile in the seventh year 3023 Jews
29 In the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar 832 people were taken from Jerusalem
30 In the 23rd year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took Jews into exile 745 people
In all 4600 people were taken into exile
31 Then in the 37th year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah in the 12th month on the 25th day of the month King Evil-merodach of Babylon in the year he became king released King Jehoiachin of Judah and brought him out of prison 32 He spoke kindly with him and put his throne higher than the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon 33 So Jehoiachin took off his prison garments and he regularly ate before him all the days of his life 34 A regular allowance of food was given him from the king of Babylon day after day until the day of his death all the days of his life
