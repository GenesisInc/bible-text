1 This is the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh struck down Gaza 2 This is what Jehovah says
Look Waters are coming from the north
They will become a flooding torrent
And they will flood the land and everything in it The city and those inhabiting it
The men will cry out And everyone dwelling in the land will wail
 3 At the sound of the pounding hooves of his stallions At the rattling of his war chariotsAnd the rumbling of his wheels Fathers will not even turn around for their sons For their hands fall limp 4 Because the day that is coming will destroy all the Philistines It will cut off from Tyre and Sidon every remaining ally
For Jehovah will destroy the Philistines Who are the remaining ones from the island of Caphtor
 5 Baldness will come to Gaza
Ashkelon has been silenced
O remnant of their valley plain How long will you keep making cuts on yourself
 6 Ah The sword of Jehovah
How long will you not be quiet
Go back into your sheath
Take your rest and be silent
 7 How can it be quietWhen Jehovah has given it a command
Against Ashkelon and the seacoast There is where he has assigned it
