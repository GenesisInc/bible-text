1 For Moab this is what Jehovah of armies the God of Israel says
Woe to Nebo for she has been destroyed
Kiriathaim has been put to shame and captured
The secure refuge has been put to shame and shattered
 2 They no longer praise Moab
In Heshbon they have plotted her downfall
Come let us put an end to her as a nation
You too O Madmen should keep silent For the sword is following you
 3 There is the sound of an outcry from Horonaim Of destruction and great collapse
 4 Moab has been broken down
Her little ones cry out
 5 On the ascent of Luhith they weep continually as they climb
And on the way down from Horonaim they hear cries of distress over the catastrophe
 6 Flee escape for your lives
You must become like a juniper tree in the wilderness
 7 Because you trust in your works and in your treasures You will also be captured
And Chemosh will go into exile Together with his priests and his princes
 8 The destroyer will come in on every city And no city will escape
The valley will perish And the level land will be annihilated just as Jehovah has said
 9 Set up a marker for Moab For as she falls into ruins she will flee And her cities will become an object of horror Without an inhabitant
10 Cursed is the one who carries out the mission of Jehovah neglectfully
Cursed is the one who holds back his sword from bloodshed
11 The Moabites have been undisturbed since their youth Like wine that has settled on the dregs
They have not been poured from one vessel into another And they have never gone into exile
That is why their taste has remained the same And their aroma has not changed
12 Therefore look the days are coming  declares Jehovah when I will send men to overturn them They will turn them over and empty out their vessels and they will smash their large jars to pieces 13 And the Moabites will be ashamed of Chemosh just as the house of Israel is ashamed of Bethel which was their confidence
14 How dare you say We are mighty warriors ready for battle
15 Moab has been destroyed Her cities have been invaded And their choicest young men have been slaughtered 
Declares the King whose name is Jehovah of armies
16 The disaster on the Moabites is coming soon And their downfall is approaching quickly
17 All those around them will have to sympathize with them All those knowing their name
Tell them O how the mighty rod has been broken the staff of beauty
18 Come down from your glory And sit down in thirst O daughter inhabiting Dibon For the destroyer of Moab has come against you And he will bring your fortified places to ruin
19 Stand by the road and watch inhabitant of Aroer
Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping What has happened
20 Moab has been put to shame and struck with terror
Wail and cry out
Proclaim in Arnon that Moab has been destroyed
21 Judgment has come to the level land against Holon Jahaz and Mephaath 22 against Dibon Nebo and Beth-diblathaim 23 against Kiriathaim Beth-gamul and Beth-meon 24 against Kerioth and Bozrah and against all the cities of the land of Moab those far and near
25 The strength of Moab has been cut down His arm has been broken  declares Jehovah
26 Make him drunk for he has exalted himself against Jehovah
Moab wallows in his vomit And he is an object of ridicule
27 Was Israel not an object of ridicule to you
Was he found among thieves So that you should shake your head and speak against him
28 Leave the cities and live on the crag inhabitants of Moab And become like a dove that nests along the sides of the gorge
29 We have heard about the pride of Moab—he is very haughty—About his arrogance his pride his haughtiness and the loftiness of his heart
30 I know his fury  declares Jehovah But his empty talk will come to nothing
They will do nothing
31 That is why I will wail over Moab For all Moab I will cry outAnd moan for the men of Kir-heres
32 With more than the weeping for Jazer I will weep for you O vine of Sibmah
Your flourishing shoots have crossed the sea
To the sea to Jazer they have reached
Upon your summer fruit and your grape harvestThe destroyer has descended
33 Rejoicing and joyfulness have been removed from the orchardAnd from the land of Moab
I have caused the wine to stop flowing from the winepress
No one will be treading with shouts of joy
The shouting will be different shouting
34 There is an outcry from Heshbon clear to Elealeh
They raise their voice clear to Jahaz From Zoar to Horonaim to Eglath-shelishiyah
Even the waters of Nimrim will become desolate
35 I will cause to cease from Moab  declares Jehovah The one bringing an offering on the high placeAnd the one making sacrifices to his god
36 That is why my heart will moan for Moab like a flute And my heart will moan for the men of Kir-heres like a flute
For the wealth he has produced will perish
37 For every head is bald And every beard is clipped
There are cuts on every hand And there is sackcloth on their hips
38 On all the roofs of MoabAnd in all her public squares There is nothing but wailing
For I have broken MoabLike a discarded jar  declares Jehovah
39 How she is terrified Wail
How Moab has turned his back in shame
Moab has become an object of ridicule Something terrifying to all those around him
40 For this is what Jehovah says
Look Just like an eagle that swoops down He will spread his wings over Moab
41 The towns will be captured And her strongholds will be seized
In that day the heart of Moabs warriorsWill be like the heart of a woman in childbirth
42 And Moab will be annihilated from being a people For it is against Jehovah that he has exalted himself
43 Terror and the pit and the trap are before you O inhabitant of Moab  declares Jehovah
44 Anyone fleeing the terror will fall into the pit And anyone coming up from the pit will be caught in the trap
For I will bring on Moab the year of their punishment  declares Jehovah
45 In the shadow of Heshbon those fleeing stand powerless
For a fire will come out of HeshbonAnd a flame from within Sihon
It will consume the forehead of MoabAnd the skull of the sons of tumult
46 Woe to you O Moab
The people of Chemosh have perished
For your sons have been taken captive And your daughters have gone into exile
47 But I will gather the captives of Moab in the final part of the days  declares Jehovah
Down to this point is the judgment on Moab
