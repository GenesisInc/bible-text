1 In the ninth year of King Zedekiah of Judah in the tenth month King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and they besieged it
2 In the 11th year of Zedekiah in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month they broke through the city wall 3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon went in and sat down in the Middle Gate namely Nergal-sharezer the Samgar Nebo-Sarsechim the Rabsaris Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon
4 When King Zedekiah of Judah and all the soldiers saw them they fled going out of the city by night by way of the kings garden through the gate between the double wall and they continued by the way of the Arabah 5 But the Chaldean army chased after them and they overtook Zedekiah in the desert plains of Jericho They captured him and brought him up to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath where he passed sentence on him 6 The king of Babylon had the sons of Zedekiah slaughtered before his eyes there at Riblah and the king of Babylon had all the nobles of Judah slaughtered 7 Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah after which he bound him with copper fetters to bring him to Babylon
8 The Chaldeans then burned down the kings house and the houses of the people and they tore down the walls of Jerusalem 9 Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city the deserters who had defected to him and anyone who remained
10 But Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard left in the land of Judah some of the poorest people those who had nothing at all On that day he also gave them vineyards and fields to work
11 Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gave Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard these orders concerning Jeremiah 12 Take him and look after him do him no harm and grant whatever he asks of you
13 So Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard Nebushazban the Rabsaris Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag and all the principal men of the king of Babylon sent 14 and had Jeremiah taken out of the Courtyard of the Guard and handed him over to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan to be brought to his house So he lived among the people
15 While Jeremiah was confined in the Courtyard of the Guard the word of Jehovah came to him saying 16 Go and tell Ebed-melech the Ethiopian This is what Jehovah of armies the God of Israel says Here I am fulfilling my words on this city for calamity and not for good and in that day you will see it happen
17 But I will rescue you in that day  declares Jehovah and you will not be handed over to the men you fear
18 For I will surely provide you with escape and you will not fall by the sword You will have your life as a spoil because you trusted in me  declares Jehovah
