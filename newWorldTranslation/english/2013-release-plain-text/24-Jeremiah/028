1 In that same year in the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah in the fourth year in the fifth month the prophet Hananiah the son of Azzur from Gibeon said to me in the house of Jehovah in the presence of the priests and all the people 2 This is what Jehovah of armies the God of Israel says I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon 3 Within two years I am bringing back to this place all the utensils of the house of Jehovah that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from this place and brought to Babylon 4 And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim the king of Judah and all the exiles of Judah who have gone to Babylon  declares Jehovah for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon
5 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of Jehovah 6 Jeremiah the prophet said Amen May Jehovah do this May Jehovah fulfill your words that you prophesied by bringing back from Babylon to this place the utensils of the house of Jehovah and all the exiled people 7 However hear please this message that I am speaking in your ears and in the ears of all the people 8 Long ago the prophets who were prior to me and prior to you used to prophesy concerning many lands and great kingdoms about war calamity and pestilence 9 If a prophet prophesies about peace and the word of that prophet comes true then it will be known that Jehovah truly sent that prophet
10 At that Hananiah the prophet took the yoke bar off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it 11 Hananiah then said in the presence of all the people This is what Jehovah says Just like this I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two years And Jeremiah the prophet went on his way
12 After Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet this message of Jehovah came to Jeremiah 13 Go and say to Hananiah This is what Jehovah says You have broken yoke bars of wood but instead of them you will make yoke bars of iron 14 For this is what Jehovah of armies the God of Israel says I will put an iron yoke bar on the neck of all these nations to serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and they must serve him Even the wild beasts of the field I will give him
15 Jeremiah the prophet then said to Hananiah the prophet Listen please O Hananiah Jehovah has not sent you but you have caused this people to trust in a lie 16 Therefore this is what Jehovah says Look I am removing you from the face of the ground This year you will die for you have urged rebellion against Jehovah
17 So Hananiah the prophet died in that year in the seventh month
