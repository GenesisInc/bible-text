1 For the Ammonites this is what Jehovah says
Does Israel have no sons
Does he have no heir
Why has Malcam taken possession of Gad
And why are his people living in Israels cities
 2 Therefore look the days are coming  declares Jehovah When I will cause the alarm signal of war to be heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites
She will become a desolate mound And her dependent towns will be set on fire
And Israel will take possession of those who dispossessed him  says Jehovah
 3 Wail O Heshbon for Ai has been destroyed
Cry out O dependent towns of Rabbah
Put on sackcloth
Wail and rove about among the stone pens For Malcam will go into exile Together with his priests and his princes
 4 Why do you brag about the valleys About your flowing plain O unfaithful daughter Who trusts in her treasuresAnd who says Who will come against me
 5 Here I am bringing something dreadful on you  declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah of armies From all those around you
You will be dispersed in every direction And no one will gather those who flee
 6 But afterward I will gather the captives of the Ammonites  declares Jehovah
7 For Edom this is what Jehovah of armies says
Is there no longer any wisdom in Teman
Has good advice perished from those with understanding
Has their wisdom rotted
 8 Flee turn back
Go and dwell down in the depths O inhabitants of Dedan
For I will bring disaster on EsauWhen the time comes to turn my attention to him
 9 If grape gatherers came in to you Would they not leave some behind for gleaning
If thieves came in by night They would cause only as much ruin as they wanted
10 But I will strip Esau bare
I will uncover his places of concealment So that he cannot hide
His children and his brothers and his neighbors will all be destroyed And he will be no more
11 Leave your fatherless children And I will preserve them alive And your widows will trust in me
12 For this is what Jehovah says Look If those not sentenced to drink the cup must drink it should you be left completely unpunished You will not be left unpunished for you must drink it
13 For by myself I have sworn  declares Jehovah that Bozrah will become an object of horror a reproach a devastation and a curse and all her cities will become perpetual ruins
14 I have heard a report from Jehovah An envoy has been sent among the nations saying
Gather yourselves together and come against her Prepare for battle
15 For look I have made you insignificant among the nations Despised among men
16 The shuddering you caused has deceived you The presumptuousness of your heart O you who reside in the retreats of the crag Occupying the highest hill
Although you build your nest high up like an eagle I will bring you down from there  declares Jehovah
17 And Edom must become an object of horror Everyone passing along by her will stare in horror and whistle on account of all her plagues 18 Just as in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and of their neighboring towns  Jehovah says no one will dwell there and no man will settle there
19 Look Someone will come up against the secure pastures like a lion from the dense thickets along the Jordan but in a moment I will make him run away from her And I will appoint over her the chosen one For who is like me and who will challenge me What shepherd can stand before me 20 Therefore hear O men the decision that Jehovah has made against Edom and what he has thought out against the inhabitants of Teman
Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away
He will make their dwelling place desolate because of them
21 At the sound of their falling the earth has quaked
There is an outcry
The sound has been heard as far as the Red Sea
22 Look Just like an eagle he will ascend and swoop down And he will spread out his wings over Bozrah
In that day the heart of the warriors of EdomWill become like the heart of a woman in childbirth
23 For Damascus
Hamath and Arpad have been put to shame For they have heard a bad report
They melt in fear
There is anxiety in the sea that cannot be calmed
24 Damascus has lost courage
She has turned to flee but panic has seized her
Distress and pain have taken hold of her Like a woman who is giving birth
25 How is it that the city of praise has not been abandoned The town of exultation
26 For her young men will fall in her public squares And all the soldiers will perish in that day  declares Jehovah of armies
27 I will set the wall of Damascus on fire And it will consume the fortified towers of Ben-hadad
28 For Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon struck down this is what Jehovah says
Rise up go up to Kedar And destroy the sons of the East
29 Their tents and their flocks will be taken Their tent cloths and all their goods
Their camels will be carried off And they will cry out to them Terror is all around
30 Flee go far away
Go and dwell down in the depths O inhabitants of Hazor  declares Jehovah
For King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has devised a strategy against you And he has thought out a plan against you
31 Rise up go up against the nation that is at peace Dwelling in security declares Jehovah
It has no doors or bars they live in isolation
32 Their camels will become plunder And their abundant livestock a spoil
I will scatter them to every wind Those who clip their hair at the temples And I will bring their disaster from every direction  declares Jehovah
33 And Hazor will become a lair of jackals A perpetual desolation
No one will dwell there And no man will settle in her
34 This is the word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah 35 This is what Jehovah of armies says Here I am breaking the bow of Elam the source of their mightiness 36 I will bring in on Elam the four winds from the four extremities of the heavens and I will scatter them to all these winds There will not be a nation to which the dispersed ones of Elam will not go
37 I will shatter the Elamites before their enemies and before those seeking to take their life and I will bring calamity on them my burning anger  declares Jehovah And I will send the sword after them until I have exterminated them
38 And I will set my throne in Elam and I will destroy from there the king and the princes  declares Jehovah
39 But in the final part of the days I will gather the captives of Elam  declares Jehovah
