1 Send a ram to the ruler of the land From Sela through the wildernessTo the mountain of the daughter of Zion
 2 Like a bird chased away from its nest So the daughters of Moab will be at the fords of Arnon
 3 Offer counsel carry out the decision
Make your shadow at high noon like the night
Conceal the dispersed and do not betray those fleeing
 4 May my dispersed ones reside in you O Moab
Become a place of concealment to them because of the destroyer
The oppressor will reach his end The destruction will come to an end And those trampling others down will perish from the earth
 5 Then a throne will be firmly established in loyal love
The one who sits on it in the tent of David will be faithful He will judge fairly and will swiftly execute righteousness
 6 We have heard about the pride of Moab—he is very proud—His haughtiness and his pride and his fury But his empty talk will come to nothing
 7 So Moab will wail for Moab They will all wail
Those who are stricken will moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth
 8 For the terraces of Heshbon have withered The vine of Sibmah The rulers of the nations have trampled its bright-red branches They had reached as far as Jazer They had extended into the wilderness
Its shoots had spread out and gone as far as the sea
 9 That is why I will weep over the vine of Sibmah as I weep for Jazer
With my tears I will drench you O Heshbon and Elealeh Because the shouting over your summer fruit and your harvest has ended
10 Rejoicing and joyfulness have been taken away from the orchard And there are no songs of joy or shouting in the vineyards
The treader no longer treads out wine in the presses For I have caused the shouting to cease
11 That is why deep within me I am boisterous over Moab Like the strumming of a harp And my innermost being over Kir-hareseth
12 Even when Moab wears himself out on the high place and goes to pray in his sanctuary he will accomplish nothing
13 This is the word that Jehovah previously spoke concerning Moab 14 And now Jehovah says Within three years like the years of a hired worker the glory of Moab will be disgraced with much tumult of every sort and those who remain will be very few and insignificant
