1 In the year that King Sargon of Assyria sent the Tartan to Ashdod he fought against Ashdod and captured it 2 At that time Jehovah spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz saying Go remove the sackcloth from your hips and take your sandals off your feet And he did so walking about naked and barefoot
3 Jehovah then said Just as my servant Isaiah has walked about naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Ethiopia 4 so the king of Assyria will lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia boys and old men naked and barefoot and with exposed buttocks the nakedness of Egypt 5 And they will be terrified and will be ashamed of Ethiopia their hope and of Egypt their pride 6 The inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day Look at what happened to our hope to which we fled for help and rescue from the king of Assyria How will we escape now
