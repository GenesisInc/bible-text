1 A pronouncement against Moab
Because it has been devastated in a night Ar of Moab has been silenced
Because it has been devastated in a night Kir of Moab has been silenced
 2 He has gone up to the House and to Dibon To the high places to weep
Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba
Every head is shaved bald every beard is clipped
 3 In its streets they have put on sackcloth
On their roofs and in their public squares they all wail They go down weeping
 4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out Their voice is heard as far as Jahaz
That is why the armed men of Moab keep shouting
He is trembling
 5 My heart cries out over Moab
Its fugitives have fled as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah
On the ascent of Luhith they weep as they go up On the way to Horonaim they cry out over the catastrophe
 6 For the waters of Nimrim are desolate The green grass has dried up The grass is gone and nothing green is left
 7 That is why they are carrying away what is left of their stores and their riches They are crossing the valley of poplars
 8 For the outcry echoes throughout the territory of Moab
The wailing reaches to Eglaim The wailing reaches to Beer-elim
 9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood And I have more in store for Dimon
A lion for those of Moab who escapeAnd for those remaining in the land
