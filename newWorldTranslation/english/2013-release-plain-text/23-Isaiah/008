1 Jehovah said to me Take a large tablet and write on it with an ordinary stylus Maher-shalal-hash-baz 2 And let me have it confirmed in writing by faithful witnesses Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah
3 Then I had relations with the prophetess and she became pregnant and in time gave birth to a son Jehovah then said to me Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz 4 for before the boy knows how to call out My father and My mother the resources of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria
5 Jehovah spoke to me again
 6 Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of the ShiloahAnd they rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah 7 Therefore look Jehovah will bring against themThe mighty and vast waters of the River The king of Assyria and all his glory
He will come up over all his streambedsAnd overflow all his banks 8 And sweep through Judah
He will flood and pass through reaching to the neck His outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land O Immanuel
 9 Cause harm you peoples but you will be shattered to pieces
Listen all you from distant parts of the earth
Prepare for battle but you will be shattered to pieces
Prepare for battle but you will be shattered to pieces
10 Devise a plan but it will be thwarted
Say what you like but it will not succeed For God is with us
11 With his strong hand on me this is what Jehovah said to me to warn me away from following the course of this people
12 You should not call a conspiracy what this people calls a conspiracy
Do not fear what they fear Do not tremble at it
13 Jehovah of armies—he is the One you should regard as holy He is the One you should fear And he is the One who should cause you to tremble
14 He will become as a sanctuary But as a stone to strike againstAnd as a rock to stumble overTo both houses of Israel As a trap and a snareTo the inhabitants of Jerusalem
15 Many of them will stumble and fall and be broken They will be ensnared and caught
16 Wrap up the written confirmation Seal up the law among my disciples
17 I will keep in expectation of Jehovah who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob and I will hope in him
18 Look I and the children whom Jehovah has given me are as signs and as miracles in Israel from Jehovah of armies who resides on Mount Zion
19 And if they say to you Inquire of the spirit mediums or of the fortune-tellers who chirp and mutter  is it not of their God that a people should inquire Should they inquire of the dead in behalf of the living 20 Instead they should inquire of the law and of the written confirmation
When they do not speak according to this word they have no light 21 And each one will pass through the land afflicted and hungry and because he is hungry and indignant he will curse his king and his God as he looks upward 22 Then he will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness obscurity and hard times gloom and no brightness
