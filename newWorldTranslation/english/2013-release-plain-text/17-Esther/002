1 After these things when the rage of King Ahasuerus had subsided he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decided against her 2 Then the kings personal attendants said A search should be made for young beautiful virgins for the king 3 And let the king appoint commissioners in all the provinces of his realm to bring together all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel to the house of the women Let them be put in the care of Hegai the kings eunuch and guardian of the women and let them be given beauty treatments 4 And the young woman who is most pleasing to the king will be queen instead of Vashti The suggestion was pleasing to the king and that is what he did
5 There was a certain Jewish man in Shushan the citadel whose name was Mordecai son of Jair son of Shimei son of Kish a Benjaminite 6 who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the people who were deported with King Jeconiah of Judah whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took into exile 7 He was the guardian of Hadassah that is Esther the daughter of his fathers brother for she had neither father nor mother The young woman was beautifully formed and attractive in appearance and at the death of her father and her mother Mordecai took her as his daughter 8 When the kings word and his law were proclaimed and when many young women were brought together at Shushan the citadel under the care of Hegai Esther was also taken to the kings house under the care of Hegai the guardian of the women
9 Now the young woman was pleasing to him and won his favor so he promptly arranged for her beauty treatments and her diet and he assigned to her seven selected young women from the kings house He also transferred her and her young attendants to the best place in the house of the women 10 Esther did not say anything about her people or her relatives for Mordecai had instructed her not to tell anyone 11 Day after day Mordecai would walk in front of the courtyard of the house of the women to learn about Esthers welfare and about what was happening to her
12 Each young woman had her turn to go in to King Ahasuerus after completing the 12-month treatment that was prescribed for the women for this was the way they had to fulfill their beauty treatmentâ€”six months with oil of myrrh and six months with balsam oil and various ointments for beauty treatment 13 Then the young woman was ready to go in to the king and whatever she asked for would be given her when she went from the house of the women to the kings house 14 In the evening she would go in and in the morning she would return to the second house of the women under the care of Shaashgaz the kings eunuch the guardian of the concubines She would not go to the king again unless the king had been especially pleased with her and she was requested by name
15 And when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her as his daughter to go in to the king she did not request anything except what Hegai the kings eunuch the guardian of the women recommended All the while Esther was winning the favor of everyone who saw her 16 Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal house in the tenth month that is the month of Tebeth in the seventh year of his reign 17 And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins So he put the royal headdress on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti 18 And the king held a great banquet for all his princes and his servants the banquet of Esther He then proclaimed an amnesty for the provinces and he kept giving gifts according to the means of the king
19 Now when virgins were brought together a second time Mordecai was sitting in the kings gate 20 Esther did not say anything about her relatives and her people just as Mordecai had instructed her Esther continued to do what Mordecai said just as when she was under his care
21 In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the kings gate Bigthan and Teresh two court officials of the king doorkeepers got angry and plotted to do away with King Ahasuerus 22 But Mordecai learned about it and he immediately told Queen Esther Esther then spoke to the king in Mordecais name 23 So the matter was investigated and eventually confirmed and both men were hanged on a stake and this was all recorded in the book of the history of the times in the presence of the king
