1 On the 13th day of the 12th month that is the month of Adar when the kings word and his law were to be carried out on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to overpower them the opposite happened and the Jews defeated those who hated them 2 The Jews gathered together in their cities in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those seeking to harm them and not a man could stand against them for the dread of them had fallen upon all the peoples 3 And all the princes of the provinces the satraps the governors and those handling the business of the king were supporting the Jews for they were in fear of Mordecai 4 Mordecai had become powerful in the kings house and his fame was spreading throughout all the provinces because Mordecai was steadily growing more powerful
5 The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword killing and destroying them they did whatever they wanted to those hating them 6 In Shushan the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men 7 Also they killed Parshandatha Dalphon Aspatha 8 Poratha Adalia Aridatha 9 Parmashta Arisai Aridai and Vaizatha 10 the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha the enemy of the Jews But after they killed them they did not seize any plunder
11 On that day the number of those killed in Shushan the citadel was reported to the king
12 The king said to Queen Esther In Shushan the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and the ten sons of Haman What then have they done in the rest of the kings provinces What is your petition now It will be granted you And what is your further request It will be done 13 Esther replied If it pleases the king let the Jews who are in Shushan be permitted to act tomorrow also according to todays law and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the stake 14 So the king gave orders for that to be done A law was issued in Shushan and the ten sons of Haman were hanged
15 The Jews in Shushan gathered together again on the 14th day of the month of Adar and killed 300 men in Shushan but they did not seize any plunder
16 The rest of the Jews in the provinces of the king also gathered together and defended their lives They got rid of their enemies killing 75000 of those who hated them but they did not seize any plunder 17 That was on the 13th day of the month of Adar and they rested on the 14th day and made it a day of feasting and of rejoicing
18 The Jews in Shushan gathered together on the 13th day and on the 14th day and they rested on the 15th day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing 19 That is why the rural Jews inhabiting the cities of the outlying districts made the 14th day of the month of Adar a day of rejoicing and feasting a day of celebration and a time to send portions of food to one another
20 Mordecai recorded these events and sent official letters to all the Jews in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus both near and far 21 He instructed them to observe the 14th day of the month of Adar as well as the 15th day each and every year 22 because on those days the Jews rested from their enemies and in that month their grief was changed to rejoicing and their mourning to a day of celebration They were to observe them as days of feasting and rejoicing and as a time to send portions of food to one another and gifts to the poor
23 And the Jews agreed to continue the celebration that they had started and to do what Mordecai wrote to them 24 For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite the enemy of all the Jews had schemed against the Jews to destroy them and he had cast Pur that is the Lot to throw them into a panic and to destroy them 25 But when Esther came in before the king he gave orders in writing Let his evil scheme against the Jews come back on his own head and they hanged him and his sons on the stake 26 That is why they called these days Purim after the name of the Pur Therefore because of all that was written in this letter and what they saw concerning this matter and what had come upon them 27 the Jews obligated themselves and their descendants and all those joining them to celebrate these two days without fail and to carry out what was written concerning them at the appointed time each and every year 28 These days were to be remembered and observed in every generation by each family each province and each city and these days of Purim should not cease among the Jews and their commemoration should not come to an end among their descendants
29 Then Queen Esther the daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm a second letter about Purim 30 He sent official letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces the realm of Ahasuerus in words of peace and truth 31 to confirm the observance of the days of Purim at their appointed times just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had instructed them to do and just as they had obligated themselves and their descendants to carry out including the fasting and supplication 32 And the command of Esther confirmed these matters concerning Purim and it was recorded in a book
