1 Elisha the prophet then called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him Wrap your garments around your waist and quickly take this flask of oil with you and go to Ramoth-gilead 2 When you arrive there look for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi go in and have him get up from among his brothers and take him into the innermost room 3 Then take the flask of oil and pour it out on his head and say This is what Jehovah says I anoint you as king over Israel Then open the door and flee without delay
4 So the prophets attendant got on his way to Ramoth-gilead 5 When he arrived the army chiefs were seated there He said I have a message for you O chief Jehu asked For which one of us He said For you O chief 6 So Jehu got up and went into the house the attendant poured the oil out on his head and said to him This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says I anoint you as king over Jehovahs people over Israel 7 You must strike down the house of Ahab your lord and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and of all the servants of Jehovah who died at the hands of Jezebel 8 And the whole house of Ahab will perish and I will annihilate from Ahab every male including the helpless and weak in Israel 9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah 10 As for Jezebel the dogs will eat her up in the plot of land at Jezreel and no one will bury her With that he opened the door and fled
11 When Jehu went back to the servants of his lord they asked him Is everything all right Why did this crazy man come to you He answered them You know that sort of man and his sort of talk 12 But they said That is not true Tell us please Then he said This is what he said to me and then he added This is what Jehovah says I anoint you as king over Israel 13 At this each of them quickly took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps and they blew the horn and said Jehu has become king 14 Then Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Jehoram
Jehoram had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead he with all Israel because of King Hazael of Syria 15 King Jehoram later returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Syrians inflicted on him when he fought King Hazael of Syria
Jehu now said If you agree do not let anyone escape from the city to go and report this in Jezreel 16 Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel for Jehoram was lying there wounded and King Ahaziah of Judah had gone down to see Jehoram 17 As the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel he saw the throng of Jehus men approaching At once he said I see a throng of men Jehoram said Take a cavalryman and send him to meet them and let him say Are you coming in peace 18 So a horseman went to meet him and said This is what the king says Are you coming in peace But Jehu said What do you have to do with peace Fall in behind me
The watchman then reported The messenger reached them but he has not returned 19 So he sent out a second horseman who said when he came to them This is what the king says Are you coming in peace But Jehu said What do you have to do with peace Fall in behind me
20 The watchman then reported He reached them but he has not returned and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the grandson of Nimshi for he drives like a madman 21 Jehoram said Hitch up So his war chariot was hitched up and King Jehoram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah each went out in his own war chariot to meet Jehu They encountered him in the plot of land of Naboth the Jezreelite
22 As soon as Jehoram saw Jehu he said Are you coming in peace Jehu But he said What peace could there be as long as there is the prostitution of Jezebel your mother and her many sorceries 23 At once Jehoram turned his chariot to flee and he said to Ahaziah We have been tricked Ahaziah 24 Jehu took his bow in hand and shot Jehoram between the shoulders and the arrow came out at his heart and he collapsed in his war chariot 25 He then said to Bidkar his adjutant Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite Remember you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father when Jehovah himself made this pronouncement against him 26 As surely as I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday  declares Jehovah I will repay you in this very plot of land  declares Jehovah So now pick him up and throw him into the plot of land according to the word of Jehovah
27 When King Ahaziah of Judah saw what was happening he fled by way of the garden house Later Jehu pursued him and said Strike him down also So they struck him down in the chariot on his way up to Gur which is by Ibleam But he continued his flight to Megiddo and died there 28 Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and they buried him in his grave with his forefathers in the City of David 29 It was in the 11th year of Jehoram the son of Ahab that Ahaziah had become king over Judah
30 When Jehu came to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it So she painted her eyes with black paint and adorned her head and looked down through the window 31 As Jehu came in through the gate she said Did it go well with Zimri the killer of his lord 32 Looking up to the window he said Who is on my side Who Immediately two or three court officials looked down at him 33 He said Throw her down So they threw her down and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses and he trampled her 34 After that he went in and ate and drank He then said Please take care of this accursed woman and bury her After all she is the daughter of a king 35 But when they went to bury her they did not find anything but her skull and her feet and the palms of her hands 36 When they returned and told him he said This fulfills the word of Jehovah that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite saying In the plot of land of Jezreel the dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel 37 And the dead body of Jezebel will become as manure on the surface of the field in the plot of land of Jezreel so that they may not say This is Jezebel
