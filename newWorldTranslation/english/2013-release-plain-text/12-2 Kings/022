1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned for 31 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath 2 He did what was right in Jehovahs eyes and walked in all the ways of David his forefather and he did not deviate to the right or to the left
3 In the 18th year of King Josiah the king sent Shaphan the secretary the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam to the house of Jehovah saying 4 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and let him collect all the money that is being brought into the house of Jehovah which the doorkeepers have collected from the people 5 Have them give it to those appointed over the work in the house of Jehovah who in turn will give it to the workers in the house of Jehovah who are to repair the damage to the house 6 that is to the craftsmen the builders and the masons and they are to use it to buy timbers and hewn stones to repair the house 7 But no accounting should be required of them for the money that they are given because they are trustworthy
8 Later Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary I have found the book of the Law in the house of Jehovah So Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan who began to read it 9 Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and told him Your servants have poured out the money that was found in the house and they have handed it over to those appointed over the work in the house of Jehovah 10 Shaphan the secretary also told the king There is a book that Hilkiah the priest has given me Then Shaphan began to read it before the king
11 As soon as the king heard the words of the book of the Law he ripped his garments apart 12 Then the king gave this order to Hilkiah the priest Ahikam the son of Shaphan Achbor the son of Micaiah Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the kings servant 13 Go inquire of Jehovah in my behalf in behalf of the people and in behalf of all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found for Jehovahs rage that has been set ablaze against us is great because our forefathers did not obey the words of this book by observing all that is written concerning us
14 So Hilkiah the priest Ahikam Achbor Shaphan and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah son of Harhas the caretaker of the wardrobe and she was dwelling in the Second Quarter of Jerusalem and they spoke to her there 15 She said to them This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says Tell the man who sent you to me 16 This is what Jehovah says I will bring calamity on this place and its inhabitants all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read 17 Because they have abandoned me and are making sacrifices smoke to other gods in order to offend me with all the work of their hands my rage will be set ablaze against this place and it will not be extinguished 18 But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of Jehovah this is what you should say to him This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says Regarding the words that you have heard 19 because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before Jehovah on hearing what I have spoken against this place and its inhabitants—that they would become an object of horror and a curse—and you ripped your garments apart and wept before me I also have heard you declares Jehovah 20 That is why I will gather you to your ancestors and you will be laid in your grave in peace and your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place Then they brought the reply to the king
