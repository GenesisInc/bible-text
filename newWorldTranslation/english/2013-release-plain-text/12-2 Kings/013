1 In the 23rd year of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah the king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria and he reigned for 17 years 2 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovahs eyes and he persisted in the sin that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit He did not turn away from it 3 So Jehovahs anger grew hot against Israel and he gave them into the hand of King Hazael of Syria and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael all their days
4 In time Jehoahaz begged for the favor of Jehovah and Jehovah listened to him for he had seen the oppression the king of Syria had inflicted on Israel 5 So Jehovah provided Israel with a savior to free them from Syrias grip and the Israelites were able to dwell in their homes as before 6 However they did not depart from the sin of the house of Jeroboam that he had caused Israel to commit They continued in this sin and the sacred pole continued to stand in Samaria 7 Jehoahaz was left with an army of only 50 horsemen 10 chariots and 10000 foot soldiers because the king of Syria had destroyed them trampling them like the dust at threshing time
8 As for the rest of the history of Jehoahaz all that he did and his mightiness is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel 9 Then Jehoahaz was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in Samaria and his son Jehoash became king in his place
10 In the 37th year of King Jehoash of Judah Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria and he reigned for 16 years 11 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovahs eyes not departing from all the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had made Israel commit He continued in these sins
12 As for the rest of the history of Jehoash all that he did and his mightiness and how he fought against King Amaziah of Judah is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel 13 Then Jehoash was laid to rest with his forefathers and Jeroboam sat on his throne And Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel
14 Now when Elisha became ill with the sickness from which he eventually died Jehoash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him saying My father my father The chariot of Israel and his horsemen 15 Elisha then said to him Take a bow and arrows So he took a bow and arrows 16 Then he said to the king of Israel Put your hand to the bow So he put his hand to it after which Elisha laid his hands on the kings hands 17 Then he said Open the window toward the east So he opened it Elisha said Shoot So he shot He now said Jehovahs arrow of victory the arrow of victory over Syria You will strike down Syria at Aphek until you finish it off
18 He continued Take the arrows  and he took them Then he said to the king of Israel Strike the ground So he struck the ground three times and stopped 19 At that the man of the true God grew indignant at him and said You should have struck the ground five or six times Then you would have struck down Syria until you finished it off but now you will strike down Syria only three times
20 After that Elisha died and was buried There were Moabite marauder bands that would come into the land at the beginning of the year 21 As some men were burying a man they saw the marauder band so they quickly threw the man into Elishas burial place and ran off When the man touched the bones of Elisha he came to life and stood on his feet
22 Now King Hazael of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz 23 However Jehovah extended favor and mercy to them and showed his concern for them for the sake of his covenant with Abraham Isaac and Jacob He did not want to bring them to ruin and he has not cast them away from his presence to this day 24 When King Hazael of Syria died his son Ben-hadad became king in his place 25 Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz then took back from Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities that he had taken in war from Jehoahaz his father Three times Jehoash struck him down and he recovered the cities of Israel
