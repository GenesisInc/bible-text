1 In the 17th year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of King Jotham of Judah became king 2 Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem He did not do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God as David his forefather had done 3 Instead he walked in the way of the kings of Israel and he even made his own son pass through the fire following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the Israelites 4 He also kept sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places on the hills and under every luxuriant tree
5 It was then that King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to wage war against Jerusalem They laid siege against Ahaz but were not able to capture the city 6 At that time King Rezin of Syria restored Elath to Edom after which he drove the Jews out of Elath And the Edomites entered Elath and they have occupied it down to this day 7 So Ahaz sent messengers to King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria saying I am your servant and your son Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and the hand of the king of Israel who are attacking me 8 Ahaz then took the silver and the gold that was to be found at the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the kings house and sent the king of Assyria a bribe 9 The king of Assyria responded to his request and he went up to Damascus and captured it and led its people into exile to Kir and he put Rezin to death
10 Then King Ahaz went to meet King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria at Damascus When he saw the altar that was in Damascus King Ahaz sent Urijah the priest a plan of the altar showing its pattern and how it was made 11 Urijah the priest built an altar according to all the directions that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus Urijah the priest finished building it before King Ahaz returned from Damascus 12 When the king returned from Damascus and saw the altar he approached the altar and made offerings on it 13 And on that altar he continued to make his burnt offerings and his grain offerings smoke he also poured out his drink offerings and sprinkled the blood of his communion sacrifices on it 14 Then he moved the copper altar that was before Jehovah from its place in front of the house from between his own altar and the house of Jehovah and he put it at the north side of his own altar 15 King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest Make the morning burnt offering smoke on the great altar also the evening grain offering the kings burnt offering and his grain offering as well as the burnt offerings the grain offerings and the drink offerings of all the people You should also sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offerings and all the blood of the other sacrifices As for the copper altar let me decide what to do with it 16 And Urijah the priest did everything that King Ahaz had commanded
17 Furthermore King Ahaz cut the side panels of the carriages into pieces and removed the basins from them and he took the Sea down off the copper bulls that supported it and put it on a stone pavement 18 And the covered structure for the Sabbath that had been built in the house and the kings outer entryway he shifted away from the house of Jehovah he did so because of the king of Assyria
19 As for the rest of the history of Ahaz what he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah 20 Then Ahaz was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David and his son Hezekiah became king in his place
