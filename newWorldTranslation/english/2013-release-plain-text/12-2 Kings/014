1 In the second year of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz the king of Israel Amaziah the son of King Jehoash of Judah became king 2 He was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem 3 He continued to do what was right in Jehovahs eyes but not like David his forefather He did everything as Jehoash his father had done 4 However the high places were not removed and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places 5 As soon as he had the kingdom firmly in his control he struck down his servants who had struck down his father the king 6 But he did not put the sons of the murderers to death in harmony with Jehovahs commandment written in the book of Moses Law Fathers should not be put to death for their sons and sons should not be put to death for their fathers but each one should be put to death for his own sin 7 He struck down the Edomites in the Valley of Salt 10000 men and captured Sela in the war and its name became Joktheel to this day
8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu the king of Israel saying Come let us confront each other in battle 9 King Jehoash of Israel sent this message to King Amaziah of Judah The thorny weed in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon Give your daughter to my son as a wife However a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thorny weed 10 True you have struck down Edom so your heart has become arrogant Enjoy your glory but stay in your own house Why should you provoke disaster and fall bringing Judah down with you 11 But Amaziah did not listen
So King Jehoash of Israel went up and he and King Amaziah of Judah confronted each other in battle at Beth-shemesh which belongs to Judah 12 Judah was defeated by Israel so each one fled to his home 13 King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah son of Jehoash son of Ahaziah at Beth-shemesh Then they came to Jerusalem and he made a breach in the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate 400 cubits 14 He took all the gold and the silver and all the articles that were found in the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the house of the king as well as hostages Then he returned to Samaria
15 As for the rest of the history of Jehoash what he did and his mightiness and how he fought against King Amaziah of Judah is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel 16 Then Jehoash was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel and his son Jeroboam became king in his place
17 Amaziah the son of Jehoash the king of Judah lived for 15 years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz the king of Israel 18 As for the rest of the history of Amaziah is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah 19 Later a conspiracy was formed against him at Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish but they sent men after him to Lachish and put him to death there 20 So they carried him back on horses and he was buried in Jerusalem with his forefathers in the City of David 21 Then all the people of Judah took Azariah who was 16 years old and made him king in place of his father Amaziah 22 He rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after the king was laid to rest with his forefathers
23 In the 15th year of Amaziah the son of Jehoash the king of Judah Jeroboam the son of King Jehoash of Israel became king in Samaria and he reigned for 41 years 24 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovahs eyes He did not depart from all the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit 25 He restored the boundary of Israel from Lebo-hamath clear to the Sea of the Arabah according to the word that Jehovah the God of Israel spoke through his servant Jonah the son of Amittai the prophet from Gath-hepher 26 For Jehovah had seen the very bitter affliction of Israel There was no one left to help Israel not even the helpless or the weak 27 But Jehovah had promised not to wipe out the name of Israel from under the heavens So he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Jehoash
28 As for the rest of the history of Jeroboam all that he did and his mightiness how he fought and how he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah in Israel is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel 29 Then Jeroboam was laid to rest with his forefathers with the kings of Israel and his son Zechariah became king in his place
