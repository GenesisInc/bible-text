1 In Jehoiakims days King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against him and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years However he turned against him and rebelled 2 Then Jehovah began to send against him marauder bands of Chaldeans Syrians Moabites and Ammonites He kept sending them against Judah to destroy it according to Jehovahs word that he had spoken through his servants the prophets 3 Surely it was by the order of Jehovah that this happened to Judah to remove them from his sight because of all the sins that Manasseh had committed 4 and also the innocent blood that he had shed for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood and Jehovah was not willing to forgive
5 As for the rest of the history of Jehoiakim all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah 6 Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place
7 Never again did the king of Egypt venture out of his land for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Wadi of Egypt up to the Euphrates River
8 Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem His mothers name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem 9 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovahs eyes according to all that his father had done 10 During that time the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against Jerusalem and the city came under siege 11 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city while his servants were laying siege to it
12 King Jehoiachin of Judah went out to the king of Babylon along with his mother his servants his princes and his court officials and the king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign 13 Then he took out from there all the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the kings house He cut into pieces all the gold utensils that Solomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah just as Jehovah had foretold 14 He took into exile all Jerusalem all the princes all the mighty warriors and every craftsman and metalworkerâ€”he took 10000 into exile No one was left behind except the poorest people of the land 15 Thus he took Jehoiachin into exile to Babylon he also led away the kings mother the kings wives his court officials and the foremost men of the land taking them into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon 16 The king of Babylon also took into exile to Babylon all the warriors 7000 as well as 1000 craftsmen and metalworkers all of them mighty men and trained for war 17 The king of Babylon made Mattaniah Jehoiachins uncle king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah
18 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and he reigned for 11 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah 19 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovahs eyes according to all that Jehoiakim had done 20 It was because of Jehovahs anger that these things took place in Jerusalem and in Judah until he cast them out of his sight And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon
