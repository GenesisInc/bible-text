1 When Jehovah was about to take Elijah up to the heavens in a windstorm Elijah and Elisha went out from Gilgal 2 Elijah said to Elisha Stay here please because Jehovah has sent me on to Bethel But Elisha said As surely as Jehovah is living and as you are living I will not leave you So they went down to Bethel 3 Then the sons of the prophets in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him Do you know that today Jehovah is taking your master away from headship over you At this he said I already know it Be silent
4 Elijah now said to him Elisha stay here please because Jehovah has sent me on to Jericho But he said As surely as Jehovah is living and as you are living I will not leave you So they came to Jericho 5 Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached Elisha and said to him Do you know that today Jehovah is taking your master away from headship over you At this he said I already know it Be silent
6 Elijah now said to him Stay here please because Jehovah has sent me on to the Jordan But he said As surely as Jehovah is living and as you are living I will not leave you So both of them went on 7 And 50 of the sons of the prophets also went and stood watching from a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan 8 Then Elijah took his official garment and rolled it up and struck the waters and they were divided to the left and to the right so that both of them went across on the dry ground
9 As soon as they had gone across Elijah said to Elisha Ask what you want me to do for you before I am taken from you So Elisha said Please may I receive a double portion of your spirit 10 He replied You have asked a difficult thing If you see me when I am taken from you it will happen for you that way but if you do not it will not happen
11 As they were walking along speaking as they walked suddenly a fiery chariot and fiery horses made a separation between the two of them and Elijah ascended to the heavens in the windstorm 12 While Elisha was watching he was crying out My father my father The chariot of Israel and his horsemen When he could no longer see him he took hold of his own garments and ripped them into two pieces 13 After that he picked up the official garment of Elijah that had fallen off him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan 14 Then he took the official garment of Elijah that had fallen off him and struck the waters and said Where is Jehovah the God of Elijah When he struck the waters they were divided to the left and to the right so that Elisha went across
15 When the sons of the prophets at Jericho saw him from a distance they said The spirit of Elijah has settled down on Elisha So they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him 16 They said to him Here are 50 capable men with your servants Let them go please to look for your master Perhaps the spirit of Jehovah has lifted him up and then thrown him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys But he said Do not send them 17 However they kept urging him until he was embarrassed so he said Send them They sent the 50 men who kept looking for three days but did not find him 18 When they returned to him he was staying in Jericho Then he said to them Did I not tell you not to go
19 In time the men of the city said to Elisha My master can see that the city is well-situated but the water is bad and the land is barren 20 At that he said Bring me a small new bowl and put salt in it So they brought it to him 21 Then he went out to the source of the water and threw salt into it and said This is what Jehovah says I have healed this water No more will it cause death or barrenness 22 And the water has been healed down to this day according to the word spoken by Elisha
23 He went up from there to Bethel As he was going along the way some young boys came out from the city and began to jeer at him and they kept saying to him Go up you baldhead Go up you baldhead 24 Finally he turned around and looked at them and cursed them in the name of Jehovah Then two she-bears came out of the forest and tore 42 of the children to pieces 25 He kept going from there to Mount Carmel and from there he returned to Samaria
