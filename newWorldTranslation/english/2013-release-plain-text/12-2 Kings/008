1 Elisha said to the woman whose son he had restored to life Rise up and go you with your household and live as a foreigner wherever you can for Jehovah has declared a famine and it will come on the land for seven years 2 So the woman got up and did what the man of the true God said She went with her household and settled in the land of the Philistines for seven years
3 At the end of seven years the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went to appeal to the king for her house and her field 4 Now the king was speaking to Gehazi the attendant of the man of the true God saying Relate to me please all the great things that Elisha has done 5 Just as he was relating to the king how he had restored the dead one to life the woman whose son he had restored to life came to the king appealing for her house and her field At once Gehazi said My lord the king this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life 6 At that the king asked the woman and she related the story to him Then the king assigned her a court official telling him Return all that belongs to her and all the products of the field from the day she left the land until now
7 Elisha came to Damascus when Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick So the report was made to him The man of the true God has come here 8 At that the king said to Hazael Take a gift with you and go and meet the man of the true God Inquire of Jehovah through him asking Will I recover from this sickness 9 Hazael went to meet him and took a gift with him every sort of good thing of Damascus the load of 40 camels He came and stood before him and said Your son Ben-hadad the king of Syria has sent me to you asking Will I recover from this sickness 10 Elisha replied to him Go and tell him You will certainly recover  but Jehovah has shown me that he will certainly die 11 And he kept staring at him to the point of embarrassment Then the man of the true God gave way to weeping 12 Hazael asked Why is my lord weeping He replied Because I know what harm you will do to the people of Israel Their fortified places you will set on fire their choice men you will kill with the sword their children you will dash to pieces and their pregnant women you will rip open 13 Hazael said How could your servant who is a mere dog do such a deed But Elisha said Jehovah has shown me that you will be king over Syria
14 Then he left Elisha and returned to his own lord who said to him What did Elisha say to you He replied He told me that you will certainly recover 15 But the next day Hazael took a coverlet dipped it in water and held it over his face until he died And Hazael became king in his place
16 In the fifth year of Jehoram the son of Ahab the king of Israel while Jehoshaphat was king of Judah Jehoram the son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah became king 17 He was 32 years old when he became king and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem 18 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel just as those of the house of Ahab had done for Ahabs daughter had become his wife and he kept doing what was bad in Jehovahs eyes 19 But Jehovah did not want to bring Judah to ruin for the sake of David his servant since he had promised him to give a lamp to him and to his sons always
20 In his days Edom revolted against Judah and then set up its own king 21 So Jehoram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots and he rose up by night and defeated the Edomites who were surrounding him and the chariot commanders and the troops fled to their tents 22 But Edom has kept up its revolt against Judah to this day Libnah also revolted at that time
23 And the rest of the history of Jehoram all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah 24 Then Jehoram was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David And his son Ahaziah became king in his place
25 In the 12th year of Jehoram the son of Ahab the king of Israel Ahaziah the son of King Jehoram of Judah became king 26 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem His mothers name was Athaliah the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel 27 He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and kept doing what was bad in Jehovahs eyes like the house of Ahab for he was related to the house of Ahab by marriage 28 So he went with Jehoram the son of Ahab to wage war against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth-gilead but the Syrians wounded Jehoram 29 So King Jehoram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Syrians had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria Ahaziah the son of Jehoram the king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Jehoram the son of Ahab because he had been wounded
