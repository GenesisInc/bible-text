1 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death The prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came and said to him This is what Jehovah says Give instructions to your household for you will die you will not recover 2 At that he turned his face to the wall and began to pray to Jehovah 3 I beg you O Jehovah remember please how I have walked before you faithfully and with a complete heart and I have done what was good in your eyes And Hezekiah began to weep profusely
4 Isaiah had not yet gone out to the middle courtyard when Jehovahs word came to him saying 5 Go back and say to Hezekiah the leader of my people This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather says I have heard your prayer I have seen your tears Here I am healing you On the third day you will go up to the house of Jehovah 6 I will add 15 years to your life and I will rescue you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this city for my own sake and for the sake of David my servant
7 Isaiah then said Bring a cake of pressed dried figs So they brought it and applied it to the boil after which he gradually recovered
8 Hezekiah had asked Isaiah What is the sign to show that Jehovah will heal me and that I will go up on the third day to the house of Jehovah 9 Isaiah replied This is the sign from Jehovah to show you that Jehovah will carry out the word that he has spoken Do you want the shadow on the stairway to move forward ten steps or back ten steps 10 Hezekiah said It is an easy thing for the shadow to extend itself ten steps but not to go back ten steps 11 So Isaiah the prophet called out to Jehovah and He made the shadow on the stairway of Ahaz go back ten steps after it had already descended the steps
12 At that time the king of Babylon Berodach-baladan son of Baladan sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick 13 Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them his entire treasure-houseâ€”the silver the gold the balsam oil and other precious oil his armory and everything that was to be found in his treasuries There was nothing that Hezekiah did not show them in his own house and in all his dominion
14 After that Isaiah the prophet came in to King Hezekiah and asked him What did these men say and where did they come from So Hezekiah said They came from a distant land from Babylon 15 Next he asked What did they see in your house Hezekiah replied They saw everything in my house There was nothing that I did not show them in my treasuries
16 Isaiah now said to Hezekiah Hear the word of Jehovah 17 Look Days are coming and all that is in your house and all that your forefathers have stored up to this day will be carried off to Babylon Nothing will be left  says Jehovah 18 And some of your own sons to whom you will become father will be taken and will become court officials in the palace of the king of Babylon
19 At that Hezekiah said to Isaiah The word of Jehovah that you have spoken is good Then he added It is good if there will be peace and stability during my lifetime
20 As for the rest of the history of Hezekiah all his mightiness and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought the water into the city is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah 21 Then Hezekiah was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son Manasseh became king in his place
