1 Now Ahab had 70 sons in Samaria So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the princes of Jezreel the elders and the guardians of Ahabs children saying 2 Now when this letter comes to you the sons of your lord will be with you as well as the war chariots the horses a fortified city and weapons 3 Select the best and most suitable of the sons of your lord and put him on the throne of his father Then fight for the house of your lord
4 But they were overcome with fear and said Look If two kings could not stand before him how can we stand 5 So the overseer of the palace the governor of the city the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu We are your servants and we will do everything that you tell us We will not make anyone king Do whatever seems good in your eyes
6 Then he wrote them a second letter saying If you belong to me and are willing to obey me bring the heads of the sons of your lord and come to me tomorrow at this time at Jezreel
Now the 70 sons of the king were with the distinguished men of the city who were raising them 7 As soon as the letter came to them they took the sons of the king and slaughtered them 70 men and they put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel 8 The messenger came in and told him They have brought the heads of the sons of the king So he said Put them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate until morning 9 When he went out in the morning he stood before all the people and said You are innocent Yes I conspired against my lord and I killed him but who struck down all of these 10 Know then that not a single word of Jehovahs that Jehovah has spoken against the house of Ahab will go unfulfilled and Jehovah has done what he spoke through his servant Elijah 11 Moreover Jehu struck down all who were left of the house of Ahab in Jezreel as well as all his distinguished men his acquaintances and his priests until he had left him no survivor
12 Then he got up and went on his way to Samaria The binding house of the shepherds was on the way 13 There Jehu encountered the brothers of King Ahaziah of Judah and he said to them Who are you They said We are the brothers of Ahaziah and we are on our way down to ask if all is well with the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother 14 Immediately he said Capture them alive So they captured them alive and slaughtered them at the cistern of the binding house 42 men He did not let a single one of them survive
15 As he went from there he encountered Jehonadab the son of Rechab who was coming to meet him When he greeted him he said to him Is your heart fully with me just as my heart is with your heart
Jehonadab replied It is
If so give me your hand
So he gave him his hand and Jehu pulled him up into the chariot with him 16 Then he said Come along with me and see my toleration of no rivalry toward Jehovah So they had him ride with him in his war chariot 17 Then he came to Samaria and he struck down all who were left over of Ahabs house in Samaria until he had annihilated them according to Jehovahs word that he had spoken to Elijah
18 Further Jehu collected all the people together and said to them Ahab worshipped Baal a little but Jehu will worship him much more 19 So summon all the prophets of Baal all his worshippers and all his priests to me Do not let a single one be absent because I have a great sacrifice for Baal Anyone who is absent will not live But Jehu was acting with cunning to destroy the worshippers of Baal
20 Jehu continued Declare a solemn assembly for Baal So they proclaimed it 21 After that Jehu sent word throughout Israel and all the worshippers of Baal came Not a single one was left out who did not come They entered the house of Baal and the house of Baal was filled from end to end 22 He said to the one who was in charge of the wardrobe Bring out garments for all the worshippers of Baal So he brought out the clothing for them 23 Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the house of Baal He now said to the worshippers of Baal Search carefully and see that there are no worshippers of Jehovah here only worshippers of Baal 24 Finally they came in to offer up sacrifices and burnt offerings Jehu had stationed 80 of his men outside and said If any one of the men I am putting into your hands escapes it will be your life for his
25 As soon as he finished offering up the burnt offering Jehu said to the guards and the adjutants Come in and strike them down Do not let a single one escape So the guards and the adjutants struck them down with the sword and threw them out and they kept going as far as the inner sanctuary of the house of Baal 26 Then they brought out the sacred pillars of the house of Baal and burned each one 27 They tore down the sacred pillar of Baal and they tore down the house of Baal and turned it into latrines as it remains to this day
28 Thus Jehu annihilated Baal out of Israel 29 However Jehu did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit as regards the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan 30 So Jehovah said to Jehu Because you have acted well and have done what is right in my eyes by carrying out all that was in my heart to do to the house of Ahab four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel 31 But Jehu did not take care to walk in the Law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit
32 In those days Jehovah started to cut off Israel piece by piece Hazael kept attacking them throughout the territory of Israel 33 from the Jordan eastward all the land of Gilead—of the Gadites the Reubenites and the Manassites—from Aroer which is by the Arnon Valley to Gilead and Bashan
34 And the rest of the history of Jehu all that he did and all his mightiness is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel 35 Then Jehu was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in Samaria and his son Jehoahaz became king in his place 36 The length of Jehus reign over Israel was 28 years in Samaria
