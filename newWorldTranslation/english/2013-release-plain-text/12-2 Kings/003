1 Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the 18th year of King Jehoshaphat of Judah and he reigned for 12 years 2 He kept doing what was bad in Jehovahs eyes but not to the extent of his father or his mother for he removed the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made 3 However he clung to the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit He did not depart from them
4 Now Mesha the king of Moab was a sheep raiser and he used to pay 100000 lambs and 100000 unshorn rams as tribute to the king of Israel 5 As soon as Ahab died the king of Moab revolted against the king of Israel 6 So King Jehoram went out on that day from Samaria and mustered all Israel 7 He also sent a message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah saying The king of Moab has revolted against me Will you go with me to war against Moab To this he said I will go I am the same as you My people are the same as your people My horses are the same as your horses 8 Then he asked By which way should we go up He replied By the way of the wilderness of Edom
9 The king of Israel then set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom After they journeyed roundabout for seven days there was no water for the camp and for the domestic animals that were following behind them 10 The king of Israel said How terrible Jehovah has called these three kings only to give them into the hand of Moab 11 At that Jehoshaphat said Is there no prophet of Jehovah here through whom we may inquire of Jehovah So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered There is Elisha the son of Shaphat who used to pour out water on the hands of Elijah 12 Then Jehoshaphat said The word of Jehovah is with him So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him
13 Elisha said to the king of Israel What do I have to do with you Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother But the king of Israel said to him No for it is Jehovah who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab 14 To this Elisha said As surely as Jehovah of armies whom I serve is living if I did not have regard for King Jehoshaphat of Judah I would not look at you or take notice of you 15 Now bring me a harpist As soon as the harpist started playing the hand of Jehovah came on him 16 He said This is what Jehovah says Dig trench after trench in this valley 17 for this is what Jehovah says You will not see wind and you will not see rain yet this valley will be filled with water and you will drink from it you your livestock and your other animals 18 But this is a trivial thing in the eyes of Jehovah for he will also give Moab into your hand 19 You must strike down every fortified city and every choice city you should cut down every good tree you should stop up all the springs of water and you should ruin every good plot of land with stones
20 And in the morning at the time of the morning grain offering water was suddenly coming from the direction of Edom and the land became filled with the water
21 All the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them so they called together all the men who could bear arms and they stationed themselves at the border 22 When they got up early in the morning the sun was shining on the water and to the Moabites on the opposite side the water looked red like blood 23 They said This is blood The kings have surely slaughtered one another with the sword So then to the spoil O Moab 24 When they came into the camp of Israel the Israelites rose up and began striking down the Moabites who fled from them They advanced into Moab striking the Moabites down as they went 25 They tore down the cities and each man threw a stone into every good plot of land filling it with stones they stopped up every spring of water and they cut down every good tree Finally only the stone walls of Kir-hareseth remained standing and the slingers surrounded it and struck it down
26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was lost he took with him 700 men armed with swords to break through to the king of Edom but they were not able to 27 So he took his firstborn son who was going to reign in his place and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall And there came to be great indignation against Israel so they withdrew from against him and returned to their land
