1 So the king sent word and they summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem 2 After that the king went up to the house of Jehovah with all the men of Judah all the inhabitants of Jerusalem the priests and the prophetsâ€”all the people from small to great He read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of Jehovah 3 The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before Jehovah that he would follow Jehovah and keep his commandments his reminders and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul by carrying out the words of this covenant that were written in this book And all the people agreed to the covenant
4 The king then ordered Hilkiah the high priest the priests of the second rank and the doorkeepers to bring out from the temple of Jehovah all the utensils made for Baal for the sacred pole and for all the army of the heavens Then he burned them outside Jerusalem on the terraces of Kidron and he took their ashes to Bethel 5 So he put out of business the foreign-god priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to make sacrificial smoke on the high places in the cities of Judah and the surroundings of Jerusalem as well as those making sacrificial smoke to Baal to the sun to the moon to the constellations of the zodiac and to all the army of the heavens 6 He brought the sacred pole out from the house of Jehovah to the outskirts of Jerusalem to the Kidron Valley and he burned it in the Kidron Valley and ground it to dust and scattered its dust on the graves of the common people 7 He also tore down the houses of the male temple prostitutes which were in the house of Jehovah and where the women were weaving tent shrines for the sacred pole
8 Then he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah and he made unfit for worship the high places where the priests had been making sacrificial smoke from Geba to Beer-sheba He also tore down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the chief of the city which were on the left as one entered the city gate 9 The priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem but they did eat unleavened bread along with their brothers 10 He also made unfit for worship Topheth which is in the Valley of the Sons of Hinnom so that no one could make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech 11 And he prohibited the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun from entering the house of Jehovah by the chamber of Nathan-melech the court official which was in the porticoes and he burned the chariots of the sun in the fire 12 The king also tore down the altars that the kings of Judah had set up on the roof of Ahazs upper chamber as well as the altars that Manasseh had set up in two courtyards of the house of Jehovah He crushed them and scattered their dust in the Kidron Valley 13 And the king made unfit for worship the high places in front of Jerusalem that were to the south of the Mount of Ruination which Solomon the king of Israel had built to Ashtoreth the disgusting goddess of the Sidonians and to Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab and to Milcom the detestable god of the Ammonites 14 He broke the sacred pillars to pieces and cut down the sacred poles and filled their places with human bones 15 He also tore down the altar in Bethel the high place that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had made that caused Israel to sin After tearing down that altar and the high place he burned the high place ground it to dust and burned the sacred pole
16 When Josiah turned and saw the graves on the mountain he had the bones taken from the graves and burned them on the altar making it unfit for worship according to Jehovahs word that had been proclaimed by the man of the true God who foretold that these things would happen 17 Then he said What is the gravestone over there that I am looking at At this the men of the city said to him It is the grave of the man of the true God from Judah who foretold these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel 18 So he said Let him rest Do not let anyone disturb his bones So they left his bones undisturbed as well as the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria
19 Josiah also removed all the houses of worship on the high places that were in the cities of Samaria which the kings of Israel had built to offend God and he did the same thing to them that he had done at Bethel 20 So he sacrificed on the altars all the priests of the high places who were there and he burned human bones on them After that he returned to Jerusalem
21 The king now commanded all the people Hold a Passover to Jehovah your God as is written in this book of the covenant 22 No Passover like this had been held since the days when the judges had judged Israel or in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah 23 But in the 18th year of King Josiah this Passover to Jehovah was held in Jerusalem
24 Josiah also cleared out the spirit mediums the fortune-tellers the teraphim statues the disgusting idols and all the disgusting things that had appeared in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem in order to carry out the words of the Law that were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of Jehovah 25 There was no king like him prior to him who returned to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength according to all the Law of Moses nor did anyone like him rise up after him
26 Nevertheless Jehovah did not turn away from his burning anger that blazed against Judah because of all the offensive things that Manasseh had done to offend Him 27 Jehovah said I will also remove Judah from my sight just as I removed Israel and I will reject this city that I chose Jerusalem and the house about which I said My name will continue there
28 As for the rest of the history of Josiah all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah 29 In his days Pharaoh Nechoh the king of Egypt came to meet the king of Assyria by the Euphrates River and King Josiah went out to confront him but when Nechoh saw him he put him to death at Megiddo 30 So his servants transported his dead body in a chariot from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his grave Then the people of the land took Josiahs son Jehoahaz and anointed him and made him king in place of his father
31 Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem His mothers name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah 32 He began to do what was bad in Jehovahs eyes according to all that his forefathers had done 33 Pharaoh Nechoh imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath to keep him from reigning in Jerusalem and then imposed on the land a fine of 100 silver talents and a gold talent 34 Furthermore Pharaoh Nechoh made Josiahs son Eliakim king in place of his father Josiah and changed his name to Jehoiakim but he took Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt where he eventually died 35 Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh but he had to tax the land to give the silver that Pharaoh demanded He exacted an assessed amount of silver and gold from each of the people of the land to give to Pharaoh Nechoh
36 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 11 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah from Rumah 37 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovahs eyes according to all that his forefathers had done
