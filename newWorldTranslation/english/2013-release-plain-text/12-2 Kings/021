1 Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king and he reigned for 55 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Hephzibah 2 He did what was bad in Jehovahs eyes following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the people of Israel 3 He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed and he set up altars to Baal and made a sacred pole just as Ahab the king of Israel had done And he bowed down to all the army of the heavens and served them 4 He also built altars in the house of Jehovah about which Jehovah had said In Jerusalem I will put my name 5 And he built altars to all the army of the heavens in two courtyards of the house of Jehovah 6 And he made his own son pass through the fire he practiced magic looked for omens and appointed spirit mediums and fortune-tellers He did on a grand scale what was bad in Jehovahs eyes to offend him
7 He put the carved image of the sacred pole that he made into the house about which Jehovah had said to David and to his son Solomon In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel I will permanently put my name 8 And I will never again make the feet of Israel wander from the land that I gave to their forefathers provided they carefully observe all that I have commanded them the entire Law that my servant Moses ordered them to follow 9 But they did not obey and Manasseh kept leading them astray causing them to do greater evil than the nations that Jehovah had annihilated from before the Israelites
10 Jehovah kept speaking through his servants the prophets saying 11 Manasseh the king of Judah has done all these detestable things he has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites before him and he has made Judah sin with his disgusting idols 12 Therefore this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says Here I am bringing such a disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that it will make both ears of anyone who hears about it tingle 13 And I will stretch out on Jerusalem the measuring line applied to Samaria and use the leveling tool applied to the house of Ahab and I will wipe Jerusalem clean just as one wipes a bowl clean wiping it and turning it upside down 14 I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies and they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies 15 because they did what was bad in my eyes and were continually offending me from the day that their forefathers came out of Egypt to this day
16 Manasseh also shed innocent blood in very great quantity until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to the other besides his sin of causing Judah to sin by doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah 17 As for the rest of the history of Manasseh and all that he did and the sins that he committed are they not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah 18 Then Manasseh was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the garden of his house in the garden of Uzza and his son Amon became king in his place
19 Amon was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah 20 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovahs eyes just as his father Manasseh had done 21 He kept walking in all the ways that his father walked and he continued serving and bowing down to the disgusting idols that his father had served 22 So he abandoned Jehovah the God of his forefathers and he did not walk in the way of Jehovah 23 Eventually Amons servants conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house 24 But the people of the land struck down all those who conspired against King Amon and they made his son Josiah king in his place 25 As for the rest of the history of Amon what he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah 26 So they buried him in his grave in the garden of Uzza and his son Josiah became king in his place
