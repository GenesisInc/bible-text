1 In the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah the king of Israel Hezekiah the son of King Ahaz of Judah became king 2 He was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah 3 He kept doing what was right in Jehovahs eyes just as David his forefather had done 4 He was the one who removed the high places smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred pole He also crushed the copper serpent that Moses had made for down to that time the people of Israel had been making sacrificial smoke to it and it used to be called the copper serpent-idol 5 He trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah after him nor among those prior to him 6 He held fast to Jehovah He did not turn away from following him he continued to keep the commandments that Jehovah had given to Moses 7 And Jehovah was with him Wherever he went he acted wisely He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him 8 He also defeated the Philistines clear to Gaza and its territories from watchtower to fortified city
9 In the fourth year of King Hezekiah that is the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah the king of Israel King Shalmaneser of Assyria came up against Samaria and began to lay siege to it 10 They captured it at the end of three years in the sixth year of Hezekiah which was the ninth year of King Hoshea of Israel Samaria was captured 11 Then the king of Assyria took Israel into exile in Assyria and settled them in Halah and in Habor at the river Gozan and in the cities of the Medes 12 This was because they had not listened to the voice of Jehovah their God but kept violating his covenant all that Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded They neither listened nor obeyed
13 In the 14th year of King Hezekiah Sennacherib the king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them 14 So King Hezekiah of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish I am at fault Withdraw from against me and I will give whatever you may impose on me The king of Assyria imposed on King Hezekiah of Judah a fine of 300 silver talents and 30 gold talents 15 So Hezekiah gave all the silver that could be found at the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the kings house 16 At that time Hezekiah removed the doors of the temple of Jehovah and the doorposts that King Hezekiah of Judah himself had overlaid and he gave them to the king of Assyria
17 The king of Assyria then sent the Tartan the Rabsaris and the Rabshakeh with a vast army from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem They went up to Jerusalem and took up a position by the conduit of the upper pool which is at the highway of the laundrymans field 18 When they called for the king to come out Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was in charge of the household Shebnah the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came out to them
19 So the Rabshakeh said to them Please say to Hezekiah This is what the great king the king of Assyria says What is the basis for your confidence 20 You are saying I have a strategy and the power to wage war  but these are empty words In whom have you put your trust so that you dare to rebel against me 21 Look You trust in the support of this crushed reed Egypt which if a man should lean on it would enter into his palm and pierce it That is the way Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all those who trust in him 22 And if you should say to me We trust in Jehovah our God  is he not the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed while he says to Judah and Jerusalem You should bow down before this altar in Jerusalem 23 So now make this wager please with my lord the king of Assyria I will give you 2000 horses if you are able to find enough riders for them 24 How then could you drive back even one governor who is the least of my lords servants while you put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen 25 Now is it without authorization from Jehovah that I have come up against this place to destroy it Jehovah himself said to me Go up against this land and destroy it
26 At this Eliakim son of Hilkiah and Shebnah and Joah said to the Rabshakeh Speak to your servants please in the Aramaic language for we can understand it do not speak to us in the language of the Jews in the hearing of the people on the wall 27 But the Rabshakeh said to them Is it just to your lord and to you that my lord sent me to speak these words Is it not also to the men who sit on the wall those who will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you
28 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in the language of the Jews saying Hear the word of the great king the king of Assyria 29 This is what the king says Do not let Hezekiah deceive you for he is not able to rescue you out of my hand 30 And do not let Hezekiah cause you to trust in Jehovah by saying Jehovah will surely rescue us and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria 31 Do not listen to Hezekiah for this is what the king of Assyria says Make peace with me and surrender and each of you will eat from his own vine and from his own fig tree and will drink the water of his own cistern 32 until I come and take you to a land like your own land a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of olive trees and honey Then you will live and not die Do not listen to Hezekiah for he misleads you by saying Jehovah will rescue us 33 Have any of the gods of the nations rescued their land out of the hand of the king of Assyria 34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad Where are the gods of Sepharvaim Hena and Ivvah Have they rescued Samaria out of my hand 35 Who among all the gods of the lands have rescued their land out of my hand so that Jehovah should rescue Jerusalem out of my hand
36 But the people kept silent and did not say a word to him in reply for the order of the king was You must not answer him 37 But Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was in charge of the household Shebnah the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their garments ripped apart and told him the words of the Rabshakeh
