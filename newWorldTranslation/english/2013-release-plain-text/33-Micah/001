1 The word of Jehovah that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah and that he received in a vision concerning Samaria and Jerusalem
 2 Hear all you peoples
Pay attention O earth and what fills you And let the Sovereign Lord Jehovah serve as a witness against you—Jehovah from his holy temple
 3 For look Jehovah is going out from his place He will come down and tread on earths high places
 4 The mountains will melt under him And the valleys will split apartLike wax before the fire Like waters poured down a steep slope
 5 All of this is because of the revolt of Jacob Because of the sins of the house of Israel
What is the revolt of Jacob
Is it not Samaria
And what are the high places of Judah
Are they not Jerusalem
 6 I will make Samaria a heap of ruins of the field A place for planting vineyards I will hurl her stones down into the valley And I will lay bare her foundations
 7 All her graven images will be crushed to pieces And all the gifts for which she hired herself out will be burned in the fire
I will devastate all her idols
For she collected them from the wages of prostitution And they will again become the wages of prostitutes
 8 Because of this I will wail and howl I will walk barefoot and naked
My wailing will be like that of jackals And my mourning like that of ostriches
 9 For her wound cannot be healed It has come as far as Judah
The plague has spread to the gate of my people to Jerusalem
10 Do not announce it in Gath You must not weep at all
In Beth-aphrah roll in the dust
11 Cross over in nakedness and shame O inhabitants of Shaphir
The inhabitants of Zaanan have not come out
There will be wailing in Beth-ezel and it will take its support away from you
12 For the inhabitants of Maroth have waited for good But what is bad has come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem
13 Harness the chariot to the team of horses O inhabitants of Lachish
You were the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion For in you were found the revolts of Israel
14 So you will give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath
The houses of Achzib were something deceitful to the kings of Israel
15 The conqueror I will yet bring in to you O inhabitants of Mareshah
As far as Adullam the glory of Israel will come
16 Make yourselves bald and shear off your hair for your cherished children
Make yourselves as bald as an eagle For they have been taken away from you into exile
