1 In the 18th year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat Abijam became king over Judah 2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Maacah the granddaughter of Abishalom 3 He went on walking in all the sins that his father committed prior to him and his heart was not complete with Jehovah his God like the heart of David his forefather 4 However on account of David Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up his son after him and keeping Jerusalem in existence 5 For David did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah and he did not turn aside from anything that He had commanded him all the days of his life except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite 6 And there was warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life
7 As for the rest of the history of Abijam all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah There was also war between Abijam and Jeroboam 8 Then Abijam was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in the City of David and his son Asa became king in his place
9 In the 20th year of King Jeroboam of Israel Asa began to reign over Judah 10 He reigned in Jerusalem for 41 years His grandmothers name was Maacah the granddaughter of Abishalom 11 Asa did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah like David his forefather 12 He expelled the male temple prostitutes from the land and removed all the disgusting idols that his forefathers had made 13 He even removed Maacah his grandmother from her position as queen mother because she had made an obscene idol for the worship of the sacred pole Asa cut down her obscene idol and burned it in the Kidron Valley 14 But the high places were not removed Nevertheless Asas heart was complete with Jehovah all his life 15 And he brought the things that he and his father had made holy into the house of Jehovah—silver gold and various utensils
16 There was constant warfare between Asa and Baasha the king of Israel 17 So King Baasha of Israel came up against Judah and began to build up Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to King Asa of Judah 18 At that Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and the treasuries of the house of the king and handed them over to his servants King Asa then sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon the son of Hezion the king of Syria who was dwelling in Damascus saying 19 There is a treaty between me and you and between my father and your father I am sending you a gift of silver and gold Come break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will withdraw from me 20 Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of Israel and they struck down Ijon Dan Abel-beth-maacah all Chinnereth and all the land of Naphtali 21 When Baasha heard of it he immediately quit building Ramah and continued dwelling in Tirzah 22 King Asa then summoned all Judah—no one was exempt—and they carried off the stones and timbers of Ramah that Baasha had been building with and with them King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin and Mizpah
23 As for all the rest of the history of Asa all his mightiness and all that he did and the cities that he built is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah But in his old age he suffered from a disease in his feet 24 Then Asa was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with them in the City of David his forefather and his son Jehoshaphat became king in his place
25 Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of King Asa of Judah and he reigned over Israel for two years 26 He kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and walked in the way of his father and in his sin that he caused Israel to commit 27 Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon which belonged to the Philistines while Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon 28 So Baasha put him to death in the third year of King Asa of Judah and became king in his place 29 And as soon as he became king he struck down all the house of Jeroboam He did not let remain anyone breathing who belonged to Jeroboam he had them annihilated according to Jehovahs word that he had spoken through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite 30 This was because of the sins that Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit and because he had greatly offended Jehovah the God of Israel 31 As for the rest of the history of Nadab all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel 32 And there was constant warfare between Asa and King Baasha of Israel
33 In the third year of King Asa of Judah Baasha the son of Ahijah became king in Tirzah over all Israel and reigned for 24 years 34 But he kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and he walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin that he caused Israel to commit
