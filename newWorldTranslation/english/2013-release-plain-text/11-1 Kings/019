1 Then Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword 2 At that Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying So may the gods do to me and add to it if by this time tomorrow I do not make you like each one of them 3 At that he became afraid so he got up and ran for his life He came to Beer-sheba which belongs to Judah and he left his attendant there 4 He went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree and he asked that he might die He said It is enough Now O Jehovah take my life away for I am no better than my forefathers
5 Then he lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree But suddenly an angel touched him and said to him Get up and eat 6 When he looked there at his head was a round loaf on heated stones and a jug of water He ate and drank and lay down again 7 Later the angel of Jehovah came back a second time and touched him and said Get up and eat for the journey will be too much for you 8 So he got up and ate and drank and in the strength of that nourishment he went on for 40 days and 40 nights until he reached Horeb the mountain of the true God
9 There he entered a cave and spent the night and look Jehovahs word came to him telling him What are you doing here Elijah 10 To this he said I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant your altars they have torn down and your prophets they have killed with the sword and I am the only one left Now they are seeking to take my life away 11 But He said Go out and stand on the mountain before Jehovah And look Jehovah was passing by and a great and strong wind was splitting mountains and breaking crags before Jehovah but Jehovah was not in the wind After the wind there was an earthquake but Jehovah was not in the earthquake 12 After the earthquake there was a fire but Jehovah was not in the fire After the fire there was a calm low voice 13 As soon as Elijah heard it he wrapped his face in his official garment and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave Then a voice asked him What are you doing here Elijah 14 To this he said I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant your altars they have torn down and your prophets they have killed with the sword and I am the only one left Now they are seeking to take my life away
15 Jehovah said to him Return and go to the wilderness of Damascus When you arrive anoint Hazael as king over Syria 16 And you should anoint Jehu the grandson of Nimshi as king over Israel and you should anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah as prophet to take your place 17 Anyone escaping from Hazaels sword Jehu will put to death and anyone escaping from Jehus sword Elisha will put to death 18 And I still have left 7000 in Israel all whose knees have not bent down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him
19 So he went from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat while he was plowing with 12 pairs of bulls ahead of him and he was with the 12th pair So Elijah went over to him and threw his official garment on him 20 At that he left the bulls and ran after Elijah and said Please let me kiss my father and my mother Then I will follow you He replied to him Go return for what have I done to stop you 21 So he went back and took a pair of bulls and sacrificed them and he used the plowing gear to boil the meat of the bulls and gave it to the people and they ate After that he rose up and followed Elijah and began to minister to him
