1 When Hiram the king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed as king in place of his father he sent his servants to Solomon for Hiram had always been a friend of Davids 2 In turn Solomon sent word to Hiram 3 You well know that David my father was not able to build a house for the name of Jehovah his God because of the wars waged against him from every side until Jehovah put his enemies under the soles of his feet 4 But now Jehovah my God has given me rest on all sides There is no one opposing me and nothing bad happening 5 So I intend to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God just as Jehovah promised to David my father saying Your son whom I will put on your throne in your place he is the one who will build the house for my name 6 Now command your people to cut cedars of Lebanon for me My servants will work with your servants and I will pay the wages of your servants according to the rate you set for you are aware that not one of us knows how to cut trees like the Sidonians
7 When Hiram heard Solomons words he rejoiced greatly and said May Jehovah be praised today for he has given David a wise son over this great people 8 So Hiram sent word to Solomon I have heard the message you sent to me I will do all you desire in providing the cedar and juniper timbers 9 My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea and I will make them into log rafts to go by sea to the place that you designate to me I will have them broken up there and you can carry them away In exchange you will provide the food that I request for my household
10 So Hiram supplied all the timbers of cedar and juniper that Solomon desired 11 And Solomon gave Hiram 20000 cor measures of wheat as food supplies for his household and 20 cor measures of very fine olive oil That was what Solomon gave Hiram year after year 12 And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom just as He had promised him And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon and the two of them made a treaty
13 King Solomon conscripted men for forced labor out of all Israel 30000 men were conscripted 14 He would send them to Lebanon in shifts of 10000 each month They would spend a month in Lebanon and two months at their homes and Adoniram was over those conscripted for forced labor 15 Solomon had 70000 common laborers and 80000 stonecutters in the mountains 16 as well as Solomons 3300 princely deputies who served as foremen to supervise the workmen 17 At the kings order they quarried large stones expensive stones to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones 18 So Solomons builders and Hirams builders and the Gebalites did the cutting and they prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house
