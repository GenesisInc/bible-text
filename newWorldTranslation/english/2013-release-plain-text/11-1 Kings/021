1 After these things an incident took place concerning a vineyard that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite it was in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab the king of Samaria 2 Ahab said to Naboth Give me your vineyard for me to use as a vegetable garden for it is near my house Then I will give you a better vineyard to replace it Or if you prefer I will give you its value in money 3 But Naboth said to Ahab It is unthinkable from Jehovahs standpoint for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers 4 So Ahab came into his house sullen and dejected over the answer that Naboth the Jezreelite had given him when he said I will not give you the inheritance of my forefathers Then he lay down on his bed kept his face turned away and refused to eat
5 His wife Jezebel came in to him and asked him Why are you so sad that you refuse to eat 6 He replied to her Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite Give me your vineyard for money Or if you prefer let me give you another vineyard to replace it But he said I will not give you my vineyard 7 His wife Jezebel said to him Are you not the one ruling as king over Israel Get up eat something and let your heart be cheerful I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite 8 So she wrote letters in Ahabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived in Naboths city 9 She wrote in the letters Proclaim a fast and have Naboth sit at the head of the people 10 And have two good-for-nothing men sit in front of him and testify against him saying You have cursed God and the king Then bring him out and stone him to death
11 So the men of his city the elders and the nobles who lived in his city did just as was written in the letters that Jezebel sent to them 12 They proclaimed a fast and had Naboth sit at the head of the people 13 Then two of the good-for-nothing men came in and sat down in front of him and began to testify against Naboth in front of the people saying Naboth has cursed God and the king After that they brought him to the outskirts of the city and stoned him to death 14 They now sent word to Jezebel saying Naboth has been stoned to death
15 As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death she said to Ahab Get up take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refused to give you for money for Naboth is no longer alive He is dead 16 As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead Ahab got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it
17 But Jehovahs word came to Elijah the Tishbite saying 18 Get up go down to meet Ahab the king of Israel who is in Samaria There he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone to take possession of it 19 You must tell him This is what Jehovah says Have you murdered a man and also taken his property Then say to him This is what Jehovah says In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth the dogs will lick up your own blood
20 Ahab said to Elijah So you have found me O my enemy He replied I have found you Because you are determined to do what is bad in the eyes of Jehovah 21 here I am bringing calamity upon you and I will make a clean sweep after you and will annihilate from Ahab every male including the helpless and weak in Israel 22 And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for you have provoked my anger and have caused Israel to sin 23 Also concerning Jezebel Jehovah has said The dogs will eat up Jezebel in the plot of land of Jezreel 24 Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs will eat up and anyone who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat up 25 Indeed there has never been anyone like Ahab who was so determined to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah egged on by his wife Jezebel 26 He acted in the most detestable way by going after the disgusting idols just as all the Amorites had done whom Jehovah drove out from before the Israelites
27 As soon as Ahab heard these words he ripped his garments apart and put sackcloth on his body and he went on a fast and kept lying down in sackcloth and walking despondently 28 Jehovahs word then came to Elijah the Tishbite 29 Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself on my account Because he has humbled himself before me I will not bring the calamity during his lifetime I will bring the calamity upon his house in the days of his son
