1 Now the queen of Sheba heard the report about Solomon in connection with the name of Jehovah so she came to test him with perplexing questions 2 She arrived in Jerusalem with a very impressive entourage with camels carrying balsam oil and great quantities of gold and precious stones She went in to Solomon and spoke to him about everything that was close to her heart 3 Solomon then answered all her questions There was nothing too difficult for the king to explain to her
4 When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon the house that he built 5 the food of his table the seating of his servants the table service of his waiters and their attire his cupbearers and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of Jehovah she was left completely breathless 6 So she said to the king The report that I heard in my own land about your achievements and about your wisdom was true 7 But I did not put faith in the reports until I had come and had seen it with my own eyes And look I had not been told the half You have far surpassed in wisdom and prosperity the report that I heard 8 Happy are your men and happy are your servants who stand before you constantly listening to your wisdom 9 May Jehovah your God be praised who has taken pleasure in you by putting you on the throne of Israel Because of Jehovahs everlasting love for Israel he appointed you as king to administer justice and righteousness
10 Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold and a great amount of balsam oil and precious stones Never again was such a quantity of balsam oil brought in as what the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon
11 Hirams fleet of ships that carried gold from Ophir also brought from Ophir algum timbers in very great quantity and precious stones 12 The king made from the algum timbers supports for the house of Jehovah and for the kings house as well as harps and stringed instruments for the singers Such algum timbers have never again been brought in or seen down to this day
13 King Solomon also gave the queen of Sheba whatever she desired and asked for in addition to what he gave her out of his own generosity After that she left and returned to her own land together with her servants
14 And the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year amounted to 666 talents of gold 15 besides that from the merchants and the profit from the traders and from all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land
16 King Solomon made 200 large shields of alloyed gold 600 shekels of gold went on each shield 17 and 300 bucklers of alloyed gold three minas of gold went on each buckler Then the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon
18 The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with refined gold 19 There were six steps to the throne and the throne had a round canopy behind it and there were armrests on both sides of the seat and two lions were standing beside the armrests 20 And there were 12 lions standing on the six steps one at each end of the six steps No other kingdom had made anything like it
21 All the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold There was nothing made of silver for silver was considered as nothing in the days of Solomon 22 For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish on the sea along with Hirams fleet Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish would come loaded with gold and silver ivory apes and peacocks
23 So King Solomon was greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom 24 And people of all the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart 25 They would each bring a gift—articles of silver articles of gold garments armor balsam oil horses and mules—and this continued year after year
26 And Solomon kept accumulating chariots and horses he had 1400 chariots and 12000 horses and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in Jerusalem
27 The king made the silver in Jerusalem as plentiful as the stones and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the Shephelah
28 The horses of Solomon had been imported from Egypt and the company of the kings merchants would obtain the horses in droves for one price 29 Each chariot imported from Egypt cost 600 silver pieces and a horse cost 150 in turn they would export them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria
