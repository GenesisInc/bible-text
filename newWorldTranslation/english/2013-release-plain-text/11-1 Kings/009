1 As soon as Solomon had finished building the house of Jehovah the house of the king and everything Solomon desired to make 2 Jehovah appeared to Solomon a second time just as he had appeared to him in Gibeon 3 Jehovah said to him I have heard your prayer and your request for favor that you made before me I have sanctified this house that you built by permanently putting my name there and my eyes and my heart will always be there 4 And you if you walk before me as your father David walked with integrity of heart and with uprightness by doing everything I have commanded you and you obey my regulations and my judgments 5 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever just as I promised your father David saying There will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of Israel 6 But if you and your sons turn away from following me and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have put before you and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them 7 I will cut Israel off from the surface of the land that I have given to them and the house that I have sanctified for my name I will cast out of my sight and Israel will become an object of scorn and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples 8 And this house will become heaps of ruins Everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will whistle and say Why did Jehovah do that to this land and this house 9 Then they will say It was because they abandoned Jehovah their God who had brought their forefathers out of the land of Egypt and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them That is why Jehovah brought all this calamity on them
10 At the end of 20 years during which Solomon built the two houses the house of Jehovah and the house of the king 11 Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and juniper timbers and with as much gold as he desired and King Solomon gave to Hiram 20 cities in the land of Galilee 12 So Hiram went out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him but he was not satisfied with them 13 He said What sort of cities are these that you have given me my brother So they came to be called the Land of Cabul down to this day 14 In the meantime Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold
15 This is the account of those whom King Solomon conscripted for forced labor to build the house of Jehovah his own house the Mound the wall of Jerusalem Hazor Megiddo and Gezer 16 Pharaoh king of Egypt had come up and captured Gezer and had burned it with fire and he had also killed the Canaanites dwelling in the city So he gave it as a parting gift to his daughter the wife of Solomon 17 Solomon built up Gezer Lower Beth-horon 18 Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness within the land 19 as well as all of Solomons storage cities the chariot cities the cities for the horsemen and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion 20 As for all the people who were left from the Amorites the Hittites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites who were not part of the people of Israel 21 their descendants who were left in the land—those whom the Israelites had been unable to devote to destruction—were conscripted by Solomon for forced labor as slaves until this day 22 But Solomon did not make any of the Israelites slaves for they were his warriors servants princes adjutants and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen 23 There were 550 chiefs of the deputies who were over the work of Solomon the foremen over the people who were doing the work
24 But Pharaohs daughter came up from the City of David to her own house that he had built for her then he built the Mound
25 Three times a year Solomon offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices on the altar that he had built for Jehovah also making sacrificial smoke on the altar which was before Jehovah so he completed the house
26 King Solomon also made a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber which is by Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom 27 Hiram sent his own servants with the fleet of ships experienced seamen to serve along with the servants of Solomon 28 They went to Ophir and took from there 420 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon
