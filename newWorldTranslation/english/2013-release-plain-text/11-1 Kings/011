1 But King Solomon loved many foreign women besides the daughter of Pharaoh Moabite Ammonite Edomite Sidonian and Hittite women 2 They were from the nations about whom Jehovah had said to the Israelites You must not go in among them and they should not come in among you for they will surely incline your heart to follow their gods But Solomon clung to them and loved them 3 And he had 700 wives who were princesses and 300 concubines and his wives gradually inclined his heart 4 In Solomons old age his wives inclined his heart to follow other gods and his heart was not complete with Jehovah his God like the heart of David his father 5 And Solomon followed after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Milcom the disgusting god of the Ammonites 6 And Solomon did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and he did not follow Jehovah completely as David his father had done
7 It was then that Solomon built a high place to Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab on the mountain in front of Jerusalem and to Molech the disgusting god of the Ammonites 8 That was what he did for all his foreign wives who were making sacrificial smoke and sacrificing to their gods
9 Jehovah became furious at Solomon because his heart had inclined away from Jehovah the God of Israel who had appeared to him twice 10 and had warned him about this very thing that he should not go after other gods But he did not obey what Jehovah had commanded 11 Jehovah now said to Solomon Because you have done this and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes as I commanded you I will surely rip the kingdom away from you and I will give it to one of your servants 12 However for the sake of your father David I will not do it in your lifetime I will rip it out of the hand of your son 13 but I will not rip away the entire kingdom One tribe I will give to your son for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen
14 Jehovah then raised up a resister against Solomon Hadad the Edomite of the royal family of Edom 15 When David defeated Edom Joab the chief of the army went up to bury the slain and he tried to strike down every male in Edom 16 For Joab and all Israel stayed there for six months until he had done away with every male in Edom 17 But Hadad fled with some of his fathers Edomite servants and they went to Egypt Hadad was then a young boy 18 So they set out from Midian and came to Paran They took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt who gave him a house assigned him a food allowance and gave him land 19 Hadad found favor in the eyes of Pharaoh so much so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife Tahpenes the queen 20 In time the sister of Tahpenes bore him a son Genubath and Tahpenes brought him up in the house of Pharaoh and Genubath remained in the house of Pharaoh among the sons of Pharaoh
21 Hadad heard in Egypt that David had been laid to rest with his forefathers and that Joab the chief of the army had died So Hadad said to Pharaoh Send me away so that I may go to my own land 22 But Pharaoh said to him What have you lacked with me that you now seek to go to your own land To this he said Nothing but please send me away
23 God also raised up against Solomon another resister Rezon the son of Eliada who had fled from his lord Hadadezer the king of Zobah 24 He gathered men to himself and became chief of a marauder band when David defeated them So they went to Damascus and settled there and began reigning in Damascus 25 And he became a resister of Israel all the days of Solomon adding to the harm done by Hadad and he abhorred Israel while he reigned over Syria
26 And there was Jeroboam the son of Nebat an Ephraimite from Zeredah a servant of Solomons whose mothers name was Zeruah a widow He too began to rebel against the king 27 This is why he rebelled against the king Solomon had built the Mound and had closed up the gap of the City of David his father 28 Now this Jeroboam was a capable man When Solomon saw that the young man was a hard worker he made him overseer over all the compulsory service of the house of Joseph 29 During that time Jeroboam went out from Jerusalem and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road Ahijah was wearing a new garment and the two of them were by themselves in the field 30 Ahijah took hold of the new garment he was wearing and ripped it into 12 pieces 31 Then he said to Jeroboam
Take ten pieces for yourself for this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says Here I am ripping the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and I will give you ten tribes 32 But one tribe will remain his for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel 33 I will do this because they have left me and are bowing down to Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians to Chemosh the god of Moab and to Milcom the god of the Ammonites and they have not walked in my ways by doing what is right in my eyes and observing my statutes and my judgments as his father David did 34 But I will not take the entire kingdom out of his hand and I will keep him as a chieftain for all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant whom I chose because he obeyed my commandments and my statutes 35 But I will take the kingship out of the hand of his son and give it to you that is ten tribes 36 To his son I will give one tribe so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem the city that I have chosen for myself as the place to put my name 37 I will take you and you will reign over all that you desire and you will become king over Israel 38 And if you obey all that I command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my statutes and my commandments just as David my servant did I will also be with you I will build you a lasting house just as I have built for David and I will give you Israel 39 And I will humiliate the offspring of David because of this but not always
40 So Solomon tried to put Jeroboam to death but Jeroboam fled to Egypt to Shishak the king of Egypt and he remained in Egypt until Solomons death
41 As for the rest of the history of Solomon all that he did and his wisdom is it not written in the book of the history of Solomon 42 The length of Solomons reign in Jerusalem over all Israel was 40 years 43 Then Solomon was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David his father and his son Rehoboam became king in his place
