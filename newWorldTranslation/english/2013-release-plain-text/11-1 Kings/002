1 When the time of Davids death drew near he gave his son Solomon these instructions 2 I am about to die Therefore be strong and prove yourself a man 3 You must keep your obligation to Jehovah your God by walking in his ways and by observing his statutes his commandments his judgments and his reminders as they are written in the Law of Moses then you will succeed in everything you do and everywhere you turn 4 And Jehovah will carry out his promise that he made concerning me If your sons pay attention to their way by walking faithfully before me with all their heart and soul there will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of Israel
5 You also well know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me what he did to two chiefs of the armies of Israel—Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether He killed them shedding the blood of war in peacetime and he put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet 6 You must act according to your wisdom and not let his gray hairs go down in peace to the Grave
7 But toward the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite you should show loyal love and they should be among those eating at your table for that was how they stood by me when I ran away from your brother Absalom
8 There is also with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim He was the one who cursed me with a vicious curse on the day that I was going to Mahanaim but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan I swore to him by Jehovah I will not put you to death by the sword 9 Now do not leave him unpunished for you are a wise man and you know what you should do to him you must bring his gray hairs down to the Grave with blood
10 Then David was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David 11 The length of Davids reign over Israel was 40 years In Hebron he reigned for 7 years and in Jerusalem he reigned for 33 years
12 Solomon then sat down on the throne of David his father and gradually his kingship became firmly established
13 In time Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba Solomons mother She asked Is your coming peaceable He replied It is peaceable 14 He then said I have something to say to you So she said Speak 15 He continued You well know that the kingship was to become mine and all Israel expected me to become king but the kingship eluded me and became my brothers for it was from Jehovah that it became his 16 But now there is just one request that I am making of you Do not turn me away So she said to him Speak 17 He then said Please ask Solomon the king—for he will not turn you away—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife 18 To this Bath-sheba said Very well I will speak for you to the king
19 So Bath-sheba went in to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah At once the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her Then he sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the kings mother so that she could sit at his right 20 She then said There is one small request that I am making of you Do not turn me away So the king said to her Make it my mother for I will not turn you away 21 She said Let Abishag the Shunammite be given as a wife to your brother Adonijah 22 At this King Solomon answered his mother Why are you requesting Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah You may as well request the kingship for him for he is my older brother and supporting him are Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah
23 With that King Solomon swore by Jehovah So may God do to me and add to it if it was not at the cost of his own life that Adonijah made this request 24 And now as surely as Jehovah is living who has firmly established me and seated me on the throne of David my father and who made a house for me just as he promised Adonijah will be put to death today 25 King Solomon immediately sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada who went out and struck Adonijah down and he died
26 To Abiathar the priest the king said Go to your fields in Anathoth You deserve to die but on this day I will not put you to death because you carried the Ark of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah before David my father and because you shared in all the hardships that my father suffered 27 So Solomon drove Abiathar out from serving as a priest of Jehovah to fulfill Jehovahs word against the house of Eli in Shiloh
28 When the news reached Joab—for Joab had supported Adonijah but he had not supported Absalom—Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar 29 Then King Solomon was told Joab has fled to the tent of Jehovah and he is there beside the altar So Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada saying Go strike him down 30 So Benaiah went to the tent of Jehovah and said to him This is what the king says Come out But he said No I will die here Benaiah brought word back to the king This is what Joab said and this is what he answered me 31 Then the king said to him Do just as he said strike him down and bury him and remove from me and from the house of my father the blood that Joab spilled without just cause 32 Jehovah will bring his blood back on his own head for without my father Davids knowledge he struck down and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than he was Abner the son of Ner the chief of the army of Israel and Amasa the son of Jether the chief of the army of Judah 33 Their blood will come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his offspring forever but for David his offspring his house and his throne may there be peace from Jehovah forever 34 Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck Joab down and put him to death and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness 35 Then the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place and the king appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar
36 Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there do not go out from there to any other place 37 On the day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley you can be sure that you will die Your blood will be on your own head 38 Shimei replied to the king What you have said is fair Your servant will do just as my lord the king has said So Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for many days
39 But at the end of three years two of Shimeis slaves ran away to Achish the son of Maacah the king of Gath When Shimei was told Look Your slaves are in Gath  40 Shimei immediately saddled his donkey and went to see Achish in Gath to find his slaves When Shimei returned from Gath with his slaves 41 Solomon was told Shimei has gone out of Jerusalem to Gath and has returned 42 At that the king summoned Shimei and said to him Did I not put you under oath by Jehovah and warn you On the day you go out from here to any other place you can be sure that you will die And did you not say to me What you are saying is fair I will obey 43 Why then did you not keep the oath of Jehovah and the commandment that I imposed on you 44 The king then said to Shimei You know in your heart all the injury that you did to David my father and Jehovah will bring back that injury on your own head 45 But King Solomon will be blessed and the throne of David will be firmly established before Jehovah forever 46 With that the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada who went out and struck him down and he died
Thus the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solomon
