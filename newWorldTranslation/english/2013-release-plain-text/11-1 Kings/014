1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick 2 So Jeroboam said to his wife Rise up please and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are Jeroboams wife and go to Shiloh Look Ahijah the prophet is there He is the one who spoke of me becoming king over this people 3 Take with you ten loaves of bread sprinkled cakes and a flask of honey and go to him He will then tell you what is going to happen to the boy
4 Jeroboams wife did what he said She rose up and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah Ahijahs eyes stared straight ahead and he could not see because of his age
5 But Jehovah had told Ahijah Here is the wife of Jeroboam coming to inquire of you regarding her son for he is sick I will tell you what to say to her When she arrives she will conceal her identity
6 As soon as Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she was coming into the entrance he said Come in wife of Jeroboam Why are you concealing your identity I have been assigned to give you a harsh message 7 Go tell Jeroboam This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says I raised you up from among your people to make you a leader over my people Israel 8 Then I ripped the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you But you have not become like my servant David who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart doing only what was right in my eyes 9 But you have done worse than all those who were prior to you and you made for yourself another god and metal images to offend me and it is I whom you have turned your back on 10 For that reason I am bringing calamity on the house of Jeroboam and I will annihilate from Jeroboam every male including the helpless and weak in Israel and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jeroboam just as one clears away the dung until it is all gone 11 Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs will eat and anyone who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat for Jehovah has spoken it
12 Now rise up go to your house When you set foot in the city the child will die 13 All Israel will mourn him and bury him for he alone of Jeroboams family will be laid in a grave because he is the only one of the house of Jeroboam in whom Jehovah the God of Israel has found something good 14 Jehovah will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will do away with the house of Jeroboam from that day forward yes even now 15 Jehovah will strike Israel down like a reed that sways in the water and he will uproot Israel off this good land that he gave to their forefathers and he will scatter them beyond the River because they made their sacred poles offending Jehovah 16 And he will abandon Israel because of the sins that Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit
17 At that Jeroboams wife rose up and went on her way and came to Tirzah As she came to the threshold of the house the boy died 18 So they buried him and all Israel mourned him according to Jehovahs word that he had spoken through his servant Ahijah the prophet
19 And the rest of the history of Jeroboam how he waged war and how he reigned is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel 20 And the length of Jeroboams reign was 22 years after which he was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son Nadab became king in his place
21 Meanwhile Rehoboam the son of Solomon had become king in Judah Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king and he reigned for 17 years in Jerusalem the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel as the place to put his name The name of Rehoboams mother was Naamah the Ammonitess 22 And Judah was doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and by the sins they committed they provoked him more than their forefathers had done 23 They too kept building for themselves high places sacred pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree 24 There were also male temple prostitutes in the land They acted according to all the detestable things of the nations that Jehovah had driven out before the Israelites
25 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem 26 He took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the kings house He took everything including all the gold shields that Solomon had made 27 So King Rehoboam made copper shields to replace them and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard who guarded the entrance of the kings house 28 Whenever the king came to the house of Jehovah the guards would carry them and then they would return them to the guard chamber
29 And the rest of the history of Rehoboam all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah 30 There was constant warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam 31 Then Rehoboam was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David His mothers name was Naamah the Ammonitess And his son Abijam became king in his place
