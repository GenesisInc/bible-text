1 The word of Jehovah against Baasha then came to Jehu the son of Hanani saying 2 I raised you up out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel but you kept walking in the way of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin so that they offended me with their sins 3 So I am making a clean sweep of Baasha and his house and I will make his house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat 4 Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs will eat and anyone belonging to him who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat
5 As for the rest of the history of Baasha what he did and his mightiness is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel 6 Then Baasha was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in Tirzah and Elah his son became king in his place 7 Also through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani Jehovahs word came against Baasha and his house both because of all the badness that he committed in the eyes of Jehovah by offending him with the work of his hands becoming like the house of Jeroboam and also because of his striking him down
8 In the 26th year of King Asa of Judah Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel in Tirzah and he reigned for two years 9 His servant Zimri the chief of half of his chariot forces conspired against him while he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk at the house of Arza who was over the household in Tirzah 10 Zimri came in and struck him down and put him to death in the 27th year of King Asa of Judah and he became king in his place 11 When he became king as soon as he sat down on his throne he struck down all the house of Baasha He did not spare a single male whether of his relatives or of his friends 12 Thus Zimri annihilated the whole house of Baasha according to the word that Jehovah had spoken against Baasha through Jehu the prophet 13 This was for all the sins that Baasha and his son Elah had committed and the sins they had caused Israel to commit by offending Jehovah the God of Israel with their worthless idols 14 As for the rest of the history of Elah all that he did is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel
15 In the 27th year of King Asa of Judah Zimri became king for seven days in Tirzah while the troops were camped against Gibbethon which belonged to the Philistines 16 In time the troops who were encamped heard it being said Zimri has conspired and has also struck down the king So all Israel made Omri the chief of the army king over Israel on that day in the camp 17 Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah 18 When Zimri saw that the city had been captured he went into the fortified tower of the kings house and burned the house down over himself and he died 19 This was for his own sins that he had committed by doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah by walking in the way of Jeroboam and for the sin he had caused Israel to commit 20 As for the rest of the history of Zimri and his conspiracy is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel
21 It was then that the people of Israel were divided into two factions One part of the people became followers of Tibni the son of Ginath wanting to make him king and the other part followed Omri 22 But the people who were following Omri prevailed over the people following Tibni the son of Ginath So Tibni died and Omri became king
23 In the 31st year of King Asa of Judah Omri became king over Israel and he reigned for 12 years In Tirzah he reigned for six years 24 He bought the mountain of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver and he built a city on the mountain He named the city that he built Samaria after Shemer the owner of the mountain 25 Omri kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and he was worse than all who were prior to him 26 He walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in the sin he had caused Israel to commit by offending Jehovah the God of Israel with their worthless idols 27 As for the rest of the history of Omri what he did and his mighty exploits is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel 28 Then Omri was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in Samaria and his son Ahab became king in his place
29 Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the 38th year of King Asa of Judah and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria for 22 years 30 Ahab the son of Omri was worse in the eyes of Jehovah than all those who were prior to him 31 As if it were a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat he also took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal the king of the Sidonians and began to serve Baal and to bow down to him 32 Further he set up an altar to Baal at the house of Baal that he built in Samaria 33 Ahab also made the sacred pole Ahab did more to offend Jehovah the God of Israel than all the kings of Israel prior to him
34 In his days Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho At the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation and at the cost of Segub his youngest he put up its doors according to the word of Jehovah spoken through Joshua the son of Nun
