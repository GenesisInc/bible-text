1 Now these were the heads of their paternal houses and the genealogical enrollment of those who went up with me out of Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes 2 of the sons of Phinehas Gershom of the sons of Ithamar Daniel of the sons of David Hattush 3 of the sons of Shecaniah of the sons of Parosh Zechariah and with him there was an enrollment of 150 males 4 of the sons of Pahath-moab Elieho-enai the son of Zerahiah and with him 200 males 5 of the sons of Zattu Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel and with him 300 males 6 of the sons of Adin Ebed the son of Jonathan and with him 50 males 7 of the sons of Elam Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and with him 70 males 8 of the sons of Shephatiah Zebadiah the son of Michael and with him 80 males 9 of the sons of Joab Obadiah the son of Jehiel and with him 218 males 10 of the sons of Bani Shelomith the son of Josiphiah and with him 160 males 11 of the sons of Bebai Zechariah the son of Bebai and with him 28 males 12 of the sons of Azgad Johanan the son of Hakkatan and with him 110 males 13 of the sons of Adonikam those who were the last and these were their names Eliphelet Jeiel and Shemaiah and with them 60 males 14 and of the sons of Bigvai Uthai and Zabbud and with them 70 males
15 I assembled them at the river that comes to Ahava and we camped there for three days But when I examined the people and the priests I did not find any of the Levites there 16 So I sent for Eliezer Ariel Shemaiah Elnathan Jarib Elnathan Nathan Zechariah and Meshullam who were leading men and for Joiarib and Elnathan who were instructors 17 Then I gave them a command concerning Iddo the leader in the place called Casiphia I told them to tell Iddo and his brothers the temple servants who were in Casiphia to bring to us ministers for the house of our God 18 Since the good hand of our God was upon us they brought a discreet man from the sons of Mahli the grandson of Levi the son of Israel namely Sherebiah and his sons and his brothers 18 men 19 and Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah from the Merarites his brothers and their sons 20 men 20 And there were 220 of the temple servants whom David and the princes gave to the service of the Levites all of whom had been designated by name
21 Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava to humble ourselves before our God to seek guidance from him for our journey for us and for our children and for all our goods 22 I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemies along the way because we had said to the king The good hand of our God is over all those seeking him but his strength and his anger are against all those abandoning him 23 So we fasted and made request of our God concerning this and he listened to our entreaty
24 I now set apart 12 of the chiefs of the priests namely Sherebiah and Hashabiah along with ten of their brothers 25 Then I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the utensils the contribution that the king and his advisers and his princes and all the Israelites who were present there had made to the house of our God 26 Thus I weighed out into their hand 650 talents of silver 100 silver utensils worth 2 talents 100 talents of gold 27 20 small gold bowls worth 1000 darics and 2 utensils of fine copper gleaming red as desirable as gold
28 Then I said to them You are holy to Jehovah and the utensils are holy and the silver and the gold are a voluntary offering to Jehovah the God of your forefathers 29 Guard them carefully until you weigh them out before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and the princes of the paternal houses of Israel in Jerusalem in the chambers of the house of Jehovah 30 And the priests and the Levites took the silver and the gold and the utensils that had been weighed out to them in order to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God
31 Finally we pulled away from the river Ahava on the 12th day of the first month to go to Jerusalem and the hand of our God was over us and he rescued us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the way 32 So we came to Jerusalem and stayed there for three days 33 And on the fourth day we weighed out the silver and the gold and the utensils in the house of our God and handed them over to Meremoth son of Urijah the priest and with him was Eleazar son of Phinehas and with them were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui 34 Everything was numbered and weighed and all the weight was recorded 35 Those coming out of the captivity the former exiles presented burnt sacrifices to the God of Israel 12 bulls for all Israel 96 rams 77 male lambs and 12 male goats as a sin offering all of this was a burnt offering to Jehovah
36 Then we gave the decrees of the king to the satraps of the king and the governors of the region Beyond the River and they supported the people and the house of the true God
