1 While Ezra was praying and making confession weeping and lying prostrate before the house of the true God a large crowd of men women and children of Israel gathered around him for the people were weeping profusely 2 Then Shecaniah the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam said to Ezra We have acted unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples of the land Despite this there is still hope for Israel 3 Now let us make a covenant with our God to send away all the wives and those born from them in harmony with the direction of Jehovah and of those who have reverence for the commandment of our God Let us act according to the Law 4 Get up for this matter is your responsibility and we are with you Be strong and take action
5 At that Ezra rose and had the chiefs of the priests the Levites and all Israel take an oath to do what had been said So they took an oath 6 Ezra now got up from before the house of the true God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib Although he went there he ate no food and drank no water for he was in mourning because of the unfaithfulness of the exiled people
7 Then they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the former exiles gather together at Jerusalem 8 and according to the decision of the princes and the elders anyone who did not come within three days time would have all his goods confiscated and he would be banished from the congregation of the exiled people 9 So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem within three days that is in the ninth month on the 20th day of the month All the people were sitting in a courtyard of the house of the true God shivering because of the matter at hand and because of the heavy rain
10 Then Ezra the priest rose and said to them You have acted unfaithfully by marrying foreign women and so you have added to the guilt of Israel 11 Now make confession to Jehovah the God of your forefathers and do his will Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from these foreign wives 12 To this the whole congregation answered with a loud voice It is our duty to do exactly as you say 13 However there are many people and it is the rainy season It is not possible to stand outside and the matter will not take just one or two days for we have rebelled extensively in this matter 14 So please let our princes represent the entire congregation and let all those in our cities who have married foreign women come at an appointed time along with the elders and judges of each city until we turn back the burning anger of our God from us concerning this matter
15 However Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah objected to this and the Levites Meshullam and Shabbethai supported them 16 But the former exiles did what was agreed on and Ezra the priest and the family heads of their paternal houses all designated by name convened separately on the first day of the tenth month to look into the matter 17 and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women 18 And it was discovered that some of the sons of the priests had married foreign women of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jehozadak and his brothers Maaseiah Eliezer Jarib and Gedaliah 19 But they promised to send their wives away and since they were guilty they would offer a ram of the flock for their guilt
