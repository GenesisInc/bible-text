1 In the 18th year of King Jeroboam Abijah became king over Judah 2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam
3 So Abijah went to war with an army of 400000 mighty trained warriors And Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 800000 trained men mighty warriors 4 Abijah now stood on Mount Zemaraim which is in the mountainous region of Ephraim and said Hear me O Jeroboam and all Israel 5 Do you not know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave to David a kingdom over Israel forever to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt 6 But Jeroboam the son of Nebat the servant of Davids son Solomon rose up and rebelled against his lord 7 And idle worthless men kept gathering to him And they proved superior to Rehoboam the son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young and fainthearted and he could not hold his own against them
8 And now you think you can hold your own against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David because you are a large crowd and you have the golden calves that Jeroboam made as gods for you 9 Have you not driven out Jehovahs priests the descendants of Aaron and the Levites and have you not appointed your own priests just like the peoples of the other lands Anyone who came along with a young bull and seven rams could become a priest of what are not gods 10 As for us Jehovah is our God and we have not abandoned him our priests the descendants of Aaron are ministering to Jehovah and the Levites assist in the work 11 They are making burnt offerings smoke to Jehovah each morning and each evening along with perfumed incense and the layer bread is on the table of pure gold and they light up the golden lampstand and its lamps each evening because we are caring for our responsibility to Jehovah our God but you have abandoned him 12 Now look the true God is with us leading us with his priests and the signal trumpets for sounding the battle alarm against you O men of Israel do not fight against Jehovah the God of your forefathers for you will not be successful
13 But Jeroboam dispatched an ambush to come from behind them so that they were in front of Judah and the ambush was behind them 14 When the men of Judah turned around they saw that they had to fight the battle both in front and from behind So they began to cry out to Jehovah while the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets 15 The men of Judah broke out in a war cry and when the men of Judah shouted the war cry the true God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah 16 The Israelites fled before Judah and God gave them into their hand 17 Abijah and his people inflicted a great slaughter on them and the slain of Israel kept falling 500000 trained men 18 Thus the men of Israel were humbled at that time but the men of Judah proved superior because they relied on Jehovah the God of their forefathers 19 Abijah kept chasing after Jeroboam and captured cities from him Bethel and its dependent towns Jeshanah and its dependent towns and Ephrain and its dependent towns 20 And Jeroboam never regained his power during the time of Abijah then Jehovah struck him down and he died
21 But Abijah grew in strength In time he took 14 wives and he became father to 22 sons and 16 daughters 22 And the rest of Abijahs history his deeds and his words is recorded in the writings of the prophet Iddo
