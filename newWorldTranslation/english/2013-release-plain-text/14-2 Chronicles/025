1 Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem 2 He continued to do what was right in Jehovahs eyes but not with a complete heart 3 As soon as he had the kingdom firmly in his control he killed his servants who had killed his father the king 4 But he did not put their sons to death for he acted in harmony with what is written in the Law in the book of Moses where Jehovah commanded Fathers should not die for their sons and sons should not die for their fathers but each one should die for his own sin
5 And Amaziah gathered Judah together and had them stand according to the paternal houses by the chiefs of thousands and by the chiefs of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin He registered them from 20 years old and up and he found them to be 300000 trained warriors to serve in the army able to handle the lance and the large shield 6 Further he hired from Israel 100000 mighty warriors for 100 silver talents 7 But a man of the true God came to him saying O king do not let the army of Israel go with you for Jehovah is not with Israel not with any of the Ephraimites 8 But go by yourself act and be courageous in battle Otherwise the true God could cause you to stumble before an enemy for God has the power to help and to cause stumbling 9 At this Amaziah said to the man of the true God But what about the 100 talents that I have given to the troops of Israel The man of the true God replied Jehovah has the means to give you much more than that 10 So Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim sending them to their own place However they were very angry with Judah so they returned to their own place in the heat of anger
11 Then Amaziah took courage and led his own troops to the Valley of Salt and he struck down 10000 men of Seir 12 And the men of Judah captured 10000 alive So they brought them to the top of the crag and threw them down from the top of the crag and they were all dashed to pieces 13 But the members of the troop whom Amaziah had sent back from accompanying him to the war were making raids on the cities of Judah from Samaria clear to Beth-horon they struck down 3000 of them and took much spoil
14 But after Amaziah returned from striking down the Edomites he brought the gods of the men of Seir and set them up for himself as gods and he began to bow down before them and to make sacrificial smoke to them 15 So Jehovah grew very angry with Amaziah and he sent a prophet who said to him Why are you following the peoples gods that did not rescue their own people out of your hand 16 As he spoke to him the king said Did we appoint you as an adviser to the king Stop Why should they strike you down Then the prophet quit but he added I know that God has decided to bring you to ruin because you have done this and you have not listened to my advice
17 After consulting with his advisers King Amaziah of Judah sent a message to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu the king of Israel saying Come Let us confront each other in battle 18 King Jehoash of Israel sent this message to King Amaziah of Judah The thorny weed in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon Give your daughter to my son as a wife However a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thorny weed 19 You have said Look I have struck down Edom So your heart has become arrogant wanting to be glorified But now stay in your own house Why should you provoke disaster and fall bringing Judah down with you
20 But Amaziah did not listen for this was from the true God to give them into the hand of the enemy because they had followed the gods of Edom 21 So King Jehoash of Israel went up and he and King Amaziah of Judah confronted each other in battle at Beth-shemesh which belongs to Judah 22 Judah was defeated by Israel so each one fled to his home 23 King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah son of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz at Beth-shemesh Then he brought him to Jerusalem and made a breach in the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate 400 cubits 24 He took all the gold and the silver and all the articles that were found in the house of the true God with Obed-edom and in the treasuries of the kings house as well as hostages Then he returned to Samaria
25 Amaziah the son of Jehoash the king of Judah lived for 15 years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz the king of Israel 26 As for the rest of the history of Amaziah from beginning to end look is it not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel 27 From the time that Amaziah turned away from following Jehovah they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish but they sent men after him to Lachish and put him to death there 28 So they carried him back on horses and buried him with his forefathers in the city of Judah
