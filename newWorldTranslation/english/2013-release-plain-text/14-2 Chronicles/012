1 Soon after the kingship of Rehoboam was firmly established and he had become strong he abandoned the Law of Jehovah and also all Israel with him 2 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem for they had behaved unfaithfully toward Jehovah 3 He had 1200 chariots 60000 horsemen and countless troops who came with him from Egyptâ€”Libyans Sukkiim and Ethiopians 4 He captured the fortified cities of Judah and finally reached Jerusalem
5 Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak and he said to them This is what Jehovah says You have abandoned me so I have also abandoned you to the hand of Shishak 6 At that the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said Jehovah is righteous 7 When Jehovah saw that they had humbled themselves the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah saying They have humbled themselves I will not destroy them and in a little while I will rescue them I will not pour out my wrath on Jerusalem through Shishak 8 But they will become his servants so that they will know the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands
9 So King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem He took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the kings house He took everything including the gold shields that Solomon had made 10 So King Rehoboam made copper shields to replace them and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard who guarded the entrance of the kings house 11 Whenever the king came to the house of Jehovah the guards would come in and carry them and then they would return them to the guard chamber 12 Because the king humbled himself Jehovahs anger turned away from him and he did not destroy them completely Moreover there were some good things found in Judah
13 King Rehoboam strengthened his position in Jerusalem and continued to reign Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king and he reigned for 17 years in Jerusalem the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel as the place to put his name The name of the kings mother was Naamah the Ammonitess 14 But he did what was bad for he had not resolved in his heart to search for Jehovah
15 As for Rehoboams history from beginning to end is it not written among the words of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the visionary in the genealogical record And there were constant wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam 16 Then Rehoboam was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David and his son Abijah became king in his place
