1 Rehoboam went to Shechem for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king 2 As soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it he was still in Egypt because he had fled on account of King Solomon Jeroboam came back from Egypt 3 Then they sent for him and Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam and said 4 Your father made our yoke harsh But if you make the harsh service of your father easier and you lighten the heavy yoke he put on us we will serve you
5 At this he said to them Return to me after three days So the people went away 6 King Rehoboam then consulted with the older men who had served his father Solomon while he was alive saying What advice would you give on how to reply to this people 7 They answered him If you are good to this people and please them and give them a favorable answer they will always be your servants
8 However he rejected the advice that the older men gave him and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his attendants 9 He asked them What advice do you offer on how we should reply to this people who have said to me Make the yoke your father put on us lighter 10 The young men who had grown up with him said to him This is what you should say to the people who have said to you Your father made our yoke heavy but you should make it lighter for us this is what you should tell them My little finger will be thicker than my fathers hips 11 My father imposed a heavy yoke on you but I will add to your yoke My father punished you with whips but I will do so with scourges
12 Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day just as the king had said Return to me on the third day 13 But the king answered them harshly Thus King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the older men 14 He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men saying I will make your yoke heavier and I will add to it My father punished you with whips but I will do so with scourges 15 So the king did not listen to the people for this turn of events was caused by the true God in order to carry out the word that Jehovah had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat
16 As for all Israel because the king refused to listen to them the people replied to the king What share do we have in David We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse Each one to your gods O Israel Now look after your own house O David With that all Israel returned to their homes
17 But Rehoboam continued to reign over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah
18 Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram who was in charge of those conscripted for forced labor but the Israelites stoned him to death King Rehoboam managed to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem 19 And the Israelites have been in revolt against the house of David down to this day
