1 Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem He did not do what was right in Jehovahs eyes as David his forefather had done 2 Instead he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and he even made metal statues of the Baals 3 Moreover he made sacrificial smoke in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom and burned up his sons in the fire following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the Israelites 4 He also kept sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places on the hills and under every luxuriant tree
5 So Jehovah his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria so that they defeated him and carried off a great number of captives and brought them to Damascus He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel who inflicted on him a great slaughter 6 For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah 120000 in one day all brave men because they had abandoned Jehovah the God of their forefathers 7 And Zichri an Ephraimite warrior killed the kings son Maaseiah and Azrikam who was in charge of the palace and Elkanah who was second to the king 8 Moreover the Israelites took 200000 of their brothers captiveâ€”women sons and daughters they also seized a great deal of spoil and they took the spoil to Samaria
9 But a prophet of Jehovah named Oded was there He went out before the army that was coming to Samaria and said to them Look It was because Jehovah the God of your forefathers was angry with Judah that he gave them into your hand and you slaughtered them with a fury that has reached clear to the heavens 10 And now you intend to make the people of Judah and Jerusalem your male and female servants Nevertheless are you not also guilty before Jehovah your God 11 Now listen to me and return the captives whom you took from your brothers for Jehovahs burning anger is against you
12 At that some of the chiefs of the Ephraimites Azariah the son of Jehohanan Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth Jehizkiah the son of Shallum and Amasa the son of Hadlai confronted those coming in from the military campaign 13 and they said to them Do not bring the captives in here for it will make us guilty before Jehovah What you intend to do will add to our sins and to our guilt for our guilt is already great and there is burning anger against Israel 14 So the armed soldiers handed over the captives and the plunder to the princes and the entire congregation 15 Then the men who had been designated by name rose up and took hold of the captives and they provided clothes from the spoil for all those among them who were naked So they clothed them and gave them sandals food and drink and oil for their skin Furthermore they transported the feeble on donkeys and brought them to their brothers in Jericho the city of palm trees After that they returned to Samaria
16 At that time King Ahaz asked the kings of Assyria for help 17 And once again the Edomites invaded and attacked Judah and carried off captives 18 The Philistines also made a raid on the cities of the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah and captured Beth-shemesh Aijalon Gederoth Soco and its dependent towns Timnah and its dependent towns and Gimzo and its dependent towns and they settled there 19 Jehovah humbled Judah because of King Ahaz of Israel for he had let Judah go unrestrained resulting in great unfaithfulness toward Jehovah
20 King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria eventually came against him and caused him distress rather than strengthening him 21 For Ahaz had stripped the house of Jehovah and the house of the king and the houses of the princes and made a gift to the king of Assyria but it was of no help to him 22 And during his time of distress King Ahaz acted even more unfaithfully toward Jehovah 23 He began to sacrifice to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and he went on to say Because the gods of the kings of Syria are helping them I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me But they caused him and all Israel to stumble 24 Furthermore Ahaz collected the utensils of the house of the true God he then cut to pieces the utensils of the house of the true God closed the doors of the house of Jehovah and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem 25 And in all the cities of Judah he made high places for making sacrificial smoke to other gods and he offended Jehovah the God of his forefathers
26 As for the rest of his history all his dealings from beginning to end there it is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel 27 Then Ahaz was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in the city in Jerusalem for they did not bring him into the burial places of the kings of Israel And his son Hezekiah became king in his place
