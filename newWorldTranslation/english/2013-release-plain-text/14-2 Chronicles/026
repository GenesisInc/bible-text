1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah who was 16 years old and made him king in place of his father Amaziah 2 He rebuilt Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king was laid to rest with his forefathers 3 Uzziah was 16 years old when he became king and he reigned for 52 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem 4 He continued to do what was right in Jehovahs eyes just as his father Amaziah had done 5 And he kept searching for God in the days of Zechariah who taught him to fear the true God During the time he was searching for Jehovah the true God made him prosper
6 He went out and fought against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod Then he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and among the Philistines 7 The true God continued to help him against the Philistines against the Arabians who were dwelling in Gurbaal and against the Meunim 8 The Ammonites began to give tribute to Uzziah His fame eventually spread as far as Egypt for he became extremely powerful 9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem by the Corner Gate the Valley Gate and the Buttress and he fortified them 10 Further he built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns for he had a great deal of livestock he also did so in the Shephelah and on the plain He had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel for he loved agriculture
11 Moreover Uzziah came to have an army equipped for war They would go out on military campaigns organized in divisions They were numbered and registered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the command of Hananiah one of the kings princes 12 The entire number of the heads of the paternal houses who were over these mighty warriors was 2600 13 The armed forces under their command numbered 307500 men ready for war a powerful military force to support the king against the enemy 14 Uzziah equipped the entire army with shields lances helmets coats of mail bows and slingstones 15 Further in Jerusalem he made engines of war designed by engineers they were set on the towers and on the corners of the walls and could shoot arrows and large stones So his fame spread far and wide for he received tremendous help and he became strong
16 However as soon as he was strong his heart became haughty to his own ruin and he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God by entering the temple of Jehovah to burn incense on the altar of incense 17 Immediately Azariah the priest and 80 other courageous priests of Jehovah went in after him 18 They confronted King Uzziah and said to him It is not proper for you Uzziah to burn incense to Jehovah It is only the priests who should burn incense for they are the descendants of Aaron those who have been sanctified Go out from the sanctuary for you have acted unfaithfully and you will receive no glory from Jehovah God for this
19 But Uzziah who had a censer in his hand to burn incense became enraged and during his rage against the priests leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of Jehovah next to the altar of incense 20 When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned toward him they saw that he had been stricken with leprosy in his forehead So they rushed him out of there and he himself hurried out because Jehovah had struck him
21 King Uzziah remained a leper until the day of his death and he kept staying in a separate house as a leper for he had been excluded from the house of Jehovah His son Jotham was in charge of the kings house judging the people of the land
22 And the rest of the history of Uzziah from beginning to end was recorded by the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz 23 Then Uzziah was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him with his forefathers but in the burial field that belonged to the kings for they said He is a leper And his son Jotham became king in his place
