1 Now the queen of Sheba heard the report about Solomon so she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with perplexing questions She was accompanied by a very impressive entourage with camels carrying balsam oil and great quantities of gold and precious stones She went in to Solomon and spoke to him about everything that was close to her heart 2 Solomon then answered all her questions There was nothing too difficult for Solomon to explain to her
3 When the queen of Sheba had seen Solomons wisdom the house that he built 4 the food of his table the seating of his servants the table service of his waiters and their attire his cupbearers and their attire and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of Jehovah she was left completely breathless 5 So she said to the king The report that I heard in my own land about your achievements and about your wisdom was true 6 But I did not put faith in the reports until I had come and had seen it with my own eyes And look I had not been told the half of your great wisdom You have far surpassed the report that I heard 7 Happy are your men and happy are your servants who stand before you constantly listening to your wisdom 8 May Jehovah your God be praised who has taken pleasure in you by putting you on his throne as king for Jehovah your God Because your God loves Israel in order to make it continue forever he appointed you over it as king to administer justice and righteousness
9 Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold and a great quantity of balsam oil and precious stones Never again was such balsam oil brought in as what the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon
10 Moreover the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum timbers and precious stones 11 The king made from the algum timbers stairs for the house of Jehovah and for the kings house as well as harps and stringed instruments for the singers Nothing like them had ever been seen before in the land of Judah
12 King Solomon also gave the queen of Sheba whatever she desired and asked for more than what she had brought to the king Then she left and returned to her own land together with her servants
13 And the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year amounted to 666 talents of gold 14 besides that brought in by the merchants and the traders and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land who were bringing gold and silver in to Solomon
15 King Solomon made 200 large shields of alloyed gold 600 shekels of alloyed gold went on each shield 16 and 300 bucklers of alloyed gold three minas of gold went on each buckler Then the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon
17 The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold 18 There were six steps to the throne and there was a gold footstool attached to the throne and there were armrests on both sides of the seat and two lions were standing beside the armrests 19 And there were 12 lions standing on the six steps one at each end of the six steps No other kingdom had made anything like it 20 All the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold There was nothing made of silver for silver was considered as nothing in the days of Solomon 21 For the kings ships would go to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram Once every three years the ships of Tarshish would come loaded with gold and silver ivory apes and peacocks
22 So King Solomon was greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom 23 And the kings of all the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear his wisdom that the true God had put in his heart 24 They would each bring a gift—articles of silver articles of gold garments armor balsam oil horses and mules—and this continued year after year 25 And Solomon had 4000 stalls for his horses and chariots and 12000 horses and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in Jerusalem 26 And he ruled over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the boundary of Egypt 27 The king made the silver in Jerusalem as plentiful as the stones and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the Shephelah 28 And they would bring horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all the other lands
29 As for the rest of the history of Solomon from beginning to end is it not written among the words of Nathan the prophet in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the record of visions of Iddo the visionary concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat 30 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for 40 years 31 Then Solomon was laid to rest with his forefathers So they buried him in the City of David his father and his son Rehoboam became king in his place
