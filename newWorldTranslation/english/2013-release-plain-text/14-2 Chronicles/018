1 Jehoshaphat had riches and glory in abundance but he made a marriage alliance with Ahab 2 So years later he went down to Ahab at Samaria and Ahab sacrificed sheep and cattle in abundance for him and for the people with him And he urged him to go up against Ramoth-gilead 3 Then King Ahab of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead He replied to him I am the same as you and my people are the same as your people and will support you in the war
4 But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel First inquire please for the word of Jehovah 5 So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together 400 men and said to them Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead or should I refrain They said Go up and the true God will give it into the kings hand
6 Jehoshaphat then said Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah Let us also inquire through him 7 At that the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat There is still one more man through whom we can inquire of Jehovah but I hate him for he never prophesies good things concerning me but always bad He is Micaiah the son of Imlah However Jehoshaphat said The king should not say such a thing
8 So the king of Israel called a court official and said Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly 9 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were each sitting on his throne dressed in royal attire they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria and all the prophets were prophesying before them 10 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself iron horns and said This is what Jehovah says With these you will gore the Syrians until you exterminate them 11 All the other prophets were prophesying the same way saying Go up to Ramoth-gilead and you will be successful Jehovah will give it into the kings hand
12 So the messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him Look The words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king Let your word please become like theirs and speak favorably 13 But Micaiah said As surely as Jehovah is living whatever my God says is what I will speak 14 Then he came in to the king and the king asked him Micaiah should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead or should I refrain At once he replied Go up and you will be successful they will be given into your hand 15 At that the king said to him How many times must I put you under oath not to speak to me anything but the truth in the name of Jehovah 16 So he said I see all the Israelites scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd Jehovah said These have no master Let each one go back to his house in peace
17 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat Did I not tell you He will not prophesy good things concerning me only bad
18 Micaiah then said Therefore hear the word of Jehovah I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne and all the army of the heavens standing at his right and at his left 19 Jehovah then said Who will fool King Ahab of Israel so that he will go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead And one was saying one thing while another said something else 20 Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah and said I will fool him Jehovah asked him How will you do it 21 He replied I will go out and become a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets So he said You will fool him and what is more you will be successful Go out and do that 22 And now Jehovah has put a deceptive spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours but Jehovah has declared calamity for you
23 Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah now approached and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said Which way did the spirit of Jehovah pass from me to speak with you 24 Micaiah replied Look You will see which way on the day when you will enter the innermost room to hide 25 Then the king of Israel said Take Micaiah and turn him over to Amon the chief of the city and to Joash the kings son 26 Tell them This is what the king says Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and water until I return in peace 27 But Micaiah said If you do return in peace Jehovah has not spoken with me Then he added Take note all you peoples
28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead 29 The king of Israel now said to Jehoshaphat I will disguise myself and will go into the battle but you should put on your royal attire So the king of Israel disguised himself and they entered the battle 30 Now the king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders Do not fight with anyone small or great except the king of Israel 31 And as soon as the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat they said to themselves It is the king of Israel So they turned to fight against him and Jehoshaphat began to cry for help and Jehovah helped him and God at once diverted them from him 32 When the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of Israel they immediately turned back from following him
33 But one man shot his bow at random and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his coat of mail So the king said to his charioteer Turn around and take me out of the battle for I have been badly wounded 34 The fighting raged throughout that day and the king of Israel had to be propped up in the chariot facing the Syrians until the evening and he died at sunset
