1 Now the spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded 2 So he went out to meet Asa and said to him Hear me O Asa and all Judah and Benjamin Jehovah is with you as long as you remain with him and if you search for him he will let himself be found by you but if you abandon him he will abandon you 3 For a long time Israel had been without the true God without a priest teaching and without law 4 But when in their distress they returned to Jehovah the God of Israel and searched for him he let himself be found by them 5 In those times no one could travel safely for there was much unrest among all the inhabitants of the lands 6 Nation was being crushed by nation and one city by another city because God kept them in disorder with every sort of distress 7 But you be strong and do not become discouraged for your activity will be rewarded
8 As soon as Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet he took courage and removed the disgusting idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities that he had captured from the mountainous region of Ephraim and he restored Jehovahs altar that was before the porch of Jehovah 9 And he gathered together all Judah and Benjamin and the foreign residents with them from Ephraim and Manasseh and Simeon for they had deserted to him from Israel in great number when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him 10 So they were gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month of the 15th year of Asas reign 11 On that day they sacrificed to Jehovah from the spoil they had brought 700 cattle and 7000 sheep 12 Furthermore they entered into a covenant to search for Jehovah the God of their forefathers with all their heart and with all their soul 13 Whoever would not search for Jehovah the God of Israel was to be put to death whether small or great man or woman 14 So they took an oath to Jehovah with a loud voice with joyful shouting and with the trumpets and horns 15 And all Judah rejoiced over the oath for they had taken the oath with all their heart and they eagerly sought him and he let himself be found by them and Jehovah continued to give them rest on every side
16 Asa the king even removed Maacah his grandmother from her position as queen mother because she had made an obscene idol for the worship of the sacred pole Asa cut down her obscene idol and pulverized it and burned it in the Kidron Valley 17 But the high places were not removed from Israel Nevertheless Asas heart was complete all his life 18 And he brought the things that he and his father had made holy into the house of the true Godâ€”silver gold and various utensils 19 There was no war until the 35th year of Asas reign
