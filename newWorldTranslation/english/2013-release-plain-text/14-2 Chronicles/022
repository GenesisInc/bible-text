1 Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made his youngest son Ahaziah king in his place for the marauder band that came with the Arabs to the camp had killed all the older ones So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram began to reign as king of Judah 2 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem His mothers name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri
3 He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab for his mother became his adviser in acting wickedly 4 And he kept doing what was bad in Jehovahs eyes like the house of Ahab for they became his advisers after the death of his father to his destruction 5 He followed their advice and went with Jehoram the son of King Ahab of Israel to wage war against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth-gilead where the archers wounded Jehoram 6 He returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that they had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram the king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Jehoram the son of Ahab because he had been wounded 7 But God brought about the downfall of Ahaziah by his coming to Jehoram and when he came he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu the grandson of Nimshi whom Jehovah had anointed to do away with the house of Ahab 8 When Jehu began to execute judgment on the house of Ahab he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziahs brothers ministers of Ahaziah and he killed them 9 Then he looked for Ahaziah they captured him where he was hiding in Samaria and they brought him to Jehu Then they put him to death and buried him for they said He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat who searched for Jehovah with all his heart There was no one of the house of Ahaziah who had the power to rule the kingdom
10 When Athaliah Ahaziahs mother saw that her son had died she rose up and destroyed the entire royal line of the house of Judah 11 However Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took Jehoash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were to be put to death and she put him and his nurse in an inner bedroom Jehoshabeath the daughter of King Jehoram she was the wife of Jehoiada the priest and a sister of Ahaziah managed to keep him concealed from Athaliah so that she did not put him to death 12 He remained with them for six years hidden at the house of the true God while Athaliah was ruling over the land
