1 In the 36th year of the reign of Asa King Baasha of Israel came up against Judah and began to build up Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to King Asa of Judah 2 At that Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of Jehovahs house and the kings house and sent them to King Ben-hadad of Syria who was dwelling in Damascus saying 3 There is a treaty between me and you and between my father and your father I am sending you silver and gold Come break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will withdraw from me
4 Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of Israel and they struck down Ijon Dan Abel-maim and all the storage places of the cities of Naphtali 5 When Baasha heard of it he immediately quit building Ramah and abandoned his work on it 6 King Asa then took all Judah and they carried off the stones and timbers of Ramah that Baasha had been building with and with them he built up Geba and Mizpah
7 At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa of Judah and said to him Because you relied on the king of Syria and did not rely on Jehovah your God the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand 8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a very great army with many chariots and horsemen But because you relied on Jehovah he gave them into your hand 9 For the eyes of Jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him You have acted foolishly in this matter from now on there will be wars against you
10 However Asa became offended at the seer and put him in prison because he was enraged at him over this And Asa began to mistreat others among the people at that same time 11 Now the history of Asa from beginning to end is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel
12 In the 39th year of his reign Asa developed an ailment in his feet until he became very sick and even in his sickness he turned not to Jehovah but to the healers 13 Then Asa was laid to rest with his forefathers he died in the 41st year of his reign 14 So they buried him in the grand burial place that he had excavated for himself in the City of David and they laid him on a bier that had been filled with balsam oil and different sorts of ingredients mixed into a specially made ointment Further they made an extraordinarily great funeral burning for him
