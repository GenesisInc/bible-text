1 At the end of 20 years during which Solomon built the house of Jehovah and his own house 2 Solomon rebuilt the cities that Hiram had given Solomon and settled Israelites there 3 Furthermore Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it 4 Then he built up Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities that he had built in Hamath 5 He also built up Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon fortified cities with walls gates and bars 6 and Baalath as well as all of Solomons storage cities all the chariot cities the cities for the horsemen and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion
7 As for all the people who were left from the Hittites the Amorites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites who were not part of Israel 8 their descendants who were left in the land—those whom the Israelites had not exterminated—were conscripted by Solomon for forced labor until this day 9 But Solomon did not make any of the Israelites slaves for his work for they were his warriors the chiefs of his adjutants and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen 10 There were 250 chiefs of the deputies of King Solomon the foremen over the people
11 Solomon also brought Pharaohs daughter up from the City of David to the house that he had built for her for he said Although she is my wife she should not dwell in the house of King David of Israel for the places to which the Ark of Jehovah has come are holy
12 Then Solomon offered up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he had built in front of the porch 13 He followed the daily routine and made offerings according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths the new moons and the appointed festivals three times in the year—the Festival of Unleavened Bread the Festival of Weeks and the Festival of Booths 14 Further he appointed the divisions of the priests for their services according to the rule of his father David and the Levites for their posts of duty to praise and to minister in the presence of the priests according to the daily routine and the gatekeepers in their divisions for the different gates for such was the commandment of David the man of the true God 15 And they did not deviate from the kings commandment to the priests and the Levites concerning any matter or concerning the storehouses 16 So Solomons work was all well-organized from the day the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid until it was finished So the house of Jehovah was completed
17 It was then that Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom 18 Hiram sent him ships and experienced seamen by means of his own servants They went with Solomons servants to Ophir and took from there 450 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon
