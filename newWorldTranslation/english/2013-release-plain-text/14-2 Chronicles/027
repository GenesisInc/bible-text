1 Jotham was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem His mothers name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok 2 He kept doing what was right in Jehovahs eyes just as his father Uzziah had done except that he did not invade the temple of Jehovah But the people were still acting ruinously 3 He built the upper gate of Jehovahs house and he did much building on the wall of Ophel 4 He also built cities in the mountainous region of Judah and he built fortified places and towers in the wooded areas 5 He waged war against the king of the Ammonites and eventually prevailed against them so that the Ammonites gave him in that year 100 silver talents 10000 cor measures of wheat and 10000 of barley The Ammonites also paid this to him in the second and third years 6 So Jotham kept growing strong for he established his ways before Jehovah his God
7 As for the rest of the history of Jotham all his wars and his ways it is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah 8 He was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem 9 Then Jotham was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in the City of David And his son Ahaz became king in his place
