1 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem he immediately congregated the house of Judah and Benjamin 180000 trained warriors to fight against Israel in order to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam 2 Then the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of the true God saying 3 Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon the king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin 4 This is what Jehovah says You must not go up and fight against your brothers Each of you return to his house for I have caused this to happen So they obeyed the word of Jehovah and returned and did not go against Jeroboam
5 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built fortified cities in Judah 6 Thus he built up Bethlehem Etam Tekoa 7 Beth-zur Soco Adullam 8 Gath Mareshah Ziph 9 Adoraim Lachish Azekah 10 Zorah Aijalon and Hebron fortified cities that were in Judah and Benjamin 11 Further he reinforced the fortified places and put commanders in them and supplied them with food and oil and wine 12 and he supplied all the different cities with large shields and lances he reinforced them to a very great degree And Judah and Benjamin remained his
13 And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel took their stand with him coming out of all their territories 14 The Levites left their pastures and their possession and came to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had dismissed them from serving as priests to Jehovah 15 Jeroboam then appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goatlike demons and for the calves that he had made 16 And those from all the tribes of Israel who had their heart set on seeking Jehovah the God of Israel followed them to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their forefathers 17 For three years they strengthened the kingship of Judah and supported Rehoboam the son of Solomon for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years
18 Then Rehoboam took as his wife Mahalath the daughter of Davids son Jerimoth and of Abihail the daughter of Jesses son Eliab 19 In time she bore him sons Jeush Shemariah and Zaham 20 After her he married Maacah the granddaughter of Absalom In time she bore him Abijah Attai Ziza and Shelomith 21 Rehoboam loved Maacah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his other wives and concubines for he took 18 wives and 60 concubines and he became father to 28 sons and 60 daughters 22 So Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as head and leader among his brothers for he intended to make him king 23 However he acted with understanding and sent some of his sons to all the regions of Judah and Benjamin to all the fortified cities and gave them abundant provisions and acquired many wives for them
