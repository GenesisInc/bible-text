1 Josiah held a Passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem and they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice on the 14th day of the first month 2 He assigned the priests to their duties and encouraged them to carry out their service of the house of Jehovah 3 Then he said to the Levites the instructors of all Israel those who were holy to Jehovah Put the holy Ark in the house that Solomon the son of David the king of Israel built you are no longer to carry it on your shoulders Now serve Jehovah your God and his people Israel 4 And prepare yourselves by your paternal houses according to your divisions following what was written by King David of Israel and by his son Solomon 5 Stand in the holy place grouped by the paternal houses of your brothers the rest of the people with a corresponding group of the paternal house of the Levites 6 Slaughter the Passover sacrifice and sanctify yourselves and make preparation for your brothers to carry out the word of Jehovah through Moses
7 Josiah contributed flocks to the people male lambs and young male goats for the Passover sacrifices for all who were present a total of 30000 as well as 3000 cattle These were from the kings own property 8 His princes also made a contribution as a voluntary offering for the people the priests and the Levites Hilkiah Zechariah and Jehiel the leaders of the house of the true God gave to the priests 2600 Passover sacrifices and 300 cattle 9 Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel along with Hashabiah Jeiel and Jozabad the chiefs of the Levites contributed to the Levites 5000 Passover sacrifices and 500 cattle
10 The service was prepared and the priests stood at their places and the Levites by their divisions as the king had commanded 11 They slaughtered the Passover sacrifices and the priests sprinkled the blood they received from them while the Levites were skinning the animals 12 Next they prepared the burnt offerings so as to distribute them to the rest of the people who were grouped by paternal house so that they could be presented to Jehovah as it is written in the book of Moses and they did the same with the cattle 13 They cooked the Passover offering over the fire according to the custom and they cooked the holy offerings in pots cauldrons and pans after which they brought it quickly to all the rest of the people 14 Then they made preparations for themselves and for the priests because the priests the descendants of Aaron were offering up the burnt sacrifices and the fat pieces until nightfall so the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests the descendants of Aaron
15 And the singers the sons of Asaph were at their positions by the commandment of David Asaph Heman and Jeduthun the visionary of the king and the gatekeepers were at the different gates There was no need for them to leave their service because their brothers the Levites made preparations for them 16 So all the service of Jehovah was prepared on that day to hold the Passover and to offer up the burnt offerings on the altar of Jehovah according to the order of King Josiah
17 The Israelites who were present held the Passover at that time and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days 18 There had never been held a Passover like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet nor had any of the other kings of Israel held a Passover like that held by Josiah the priests the Levites all Judah and Israel who were present and the inhabitants of Jerusalem 19 This Passover was held in the 18th year of Josiahs reign
20 After all of this when Josiah had prepared the temple King Necho of Egypt came up to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates Then Josiah went out against him 21 So he sent messengers to him saying What does this have to do with you O king of Judah I am not coming against you today but my fight is against another house and God says that I should hurry For your own sake refrain from opposing God who is with me or he will bring you to ruin 22 However Josiah would not turn away from him but he disguised himself to fight against him and would not listen to the words of Necho which were from the mouth of God So he came to fight in the Plain of Megiddo
23 And the archers shot King Josiah and the king said to his servants Get me out of here for I am severely wounded 24 So his servants took him out of the chariot and had him ride in his second war chariot and brought him to Jerusalem Thus he died and was buried in the tomb of his forefathers and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned Josiah 25 And Jeremiah chanted over Josiah and all the male and female singers keep singing about Josiah in their dirges down to this day and a decision was made that they should be sung in Israel and they are written among the dirges
26 As for the rest of the history of Josiah and his deeds of loyal love in keeping with what is written in the Law of Jehovah 27 and what he did from beginning to end they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah
