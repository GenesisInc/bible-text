1 After these things and these acts of faithfulness King Sennacherib of Assyria came and invaded Judah He besieged the fortified cities intent on breaking through and capturing them
2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to wage war against Jerusalem 3 he decided after consulting with his princes and his warriors to stop up the waters of the springs outside the city and they gave him their support 4 Many people were gathered together and they stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land saying Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water
5 Furthermore with determination he rebuilt the entire broken-down wall and raised towers on it and outside he made another wall He also repaired the Mound of the City of David and he made a large number of weapons and shields 6 He then appointed military chiefs over the people and assembled them at the public square of the city gate and encouraged them saying 7 Be courageous and strong Do not be afraid or be terrified because of the king of Assyria and all the multitude with him for there are more with us than there are with him 8 With him is an arm of flesh but with us is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles And the people were strengthened by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah
9 After this while King Sennacherib of Assyria was at Lachish with all his imperial might he sent his servants to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah of Judah and to all the Judeans in Jerusalem saying
10 This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says In what are you trusting that you remain in Jerusalem while it is besieged 11 Is not Hezekiah misleading you and handing you over to die by famine and thirst saying Jehovah our God will rescue us from the hand of the king of Assyria 12 Is this not the same Hezekiah who removed your Gods high places and His altars and then said to Judah and Jerusalem You should bow down before one altar and on it you should make your sacrifices smoke 13 Do you not know what I and my forefathers did to all the peoples of the lands Were the gods of the nations of the lands able to rescue their land from my hand 14 Who among all the gods of these nations that my forefathers devoted to destruction was able to rescue his people from my hand so that your God should be able to rescue you from my hand 15 Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this Do not put faith in him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to rescue his people from my hand and from the hand of my forefathers How much less then will your own God rescue you from my hand
16 His servants said even more against Jehovah the true God and against Hezekiah his servant 17 He also wrote letters to insult Jehovah the God of Israel and to speak against him saying Like the gods of the nations of the lands who could not rescue their people from my hand so the God of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand 18 They kept calling loudly in the language of the Jews to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to make them afraid and to terrify them in order to capture the city 19 They spoke against the God of Jerusalem the same way as against the gods of the peoples of the earth which are the work of mans hands 20 But King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz kept praying about this and crying out to the heavens for help
21 Then Jehovah sent an angel and wiped out every mighty warrior leader and chief in the camp of the king of Assyria so that he went back to his own land in disgrace He later entered the house of his god and there some of his own sons struck him down with the sword 22 So Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of King Sennacherib of Assyria and from the hand of all others and gave them rest on every side 23 And many brought gifts to Jehovah at Jerusalem and choice things to King Hezekiah of Judah and he was greatly respected by all the nations after that
24 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death and he prayed to Jehovah who answered him and gave him a sign 25 But Hezekiah did not respond appreciatively to the good done to him for his heart became haughty bringing indignation against him and against Judah and Jerusalem 26 However Hezekiah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Jehovahs indignation did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah
27 And Hezekiah came to have vast riches and glory and he made storehouses for himself for silver gold precious stones balsam oil shields and for all the desirable articles 28 He also made storage places for the produce of grain and new wine and oil as well as stalls for all the different kinds of livestock and stalls for the flocks 29 He also acquired cities for himself and an abundance of livestock flocks and herds for God gave him very many possessions 30 It was Hezekiah who stopped up the upper source of the waters of Gihon and directed them straight down to the west to the City of David and Hezekiah was successful in every work of his 31 However when the spokesmen of the princes of Babylon were sent to ask him about the sign that had occurred in the land the true God left him alone to put him to the test to get to know all that was in his heart
32 As for the rest of the history of Hezekiah and his acts of loyal love they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel 33 Then Hezekiah was laid to rest with his forefathers and they buried him in the ascent to the burial places of the sons of David and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death And his son Manasseh became king in his place
