1 In the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea Herod was district ruler of Galilee Philip his brother was district ruler of the country of Ituraea and Trachonitis and Lysanias was district ruler of Abilene 2 in the days of chief priest Annas and of Caiaphas Gods declaration came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness
3 So he went into all the country around the Jordan preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins 4 just as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet A voice of one crying out in the wilderness Prepare the way of Jehovah Make his roads straight 5 Every valley must be filled up and every mountain and hill leveled the crooked ways must become straight and the rough ways smooth 6 and all flesh will see the salvation of God
7 So he began to say to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him You offspring of vipers who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath 8 Therefore produce fruits that befit repentance Do not start saying to yourselves We have Abraham as our father For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones 9 Indeed the ax is already lying at the root of the trees Every tree then that does not produce fine fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire
10 And the crowds were asking him What then should we do 11 In reply he said to them Let the man who has two garments share with the man who has none and let the one who has something to eat do the same 12 Even tax collectors came to be baptized and they said to him Teacher what should we do 13 He said to them Do not demand anything more than the tax rate 14 Also those in military service were asking him What should we do And he said to them Do not harass anybody or accuse anybody falsely but be satisfied with your provisions
15 Now the people were in expectation and all of them were reasoning in their hearts about John May he perhaps be the Christ 16 John gave the answer saying to all I for my part baptize you with water but the one stronger than I am is coming the lace of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie He will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire 17 His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor completely and to gather the wheat into his storehouse but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out
18 He also gave many other exhortations and continued declaring good news to the people 19 But Herod the district ruler because of being reproved by John concerning Herodias the wife of his brother and concerning all the wicked deeds that Herod had done 20 added this also to all those deeds He locked John up in prison
21 Now when all the people were baptized Jesus too was baptized As he was praying the heaven was opened up 22 and the holy spirit in bodily form like a dove came down upon him and a voice came out of heaven You are my Son the beloved I have approved you
23 When Jesus began his work he was about 30 years old being the son as the opinion was of Joseph son of Heli 24 son of Matthat son of Levi son of Melchi son of Jannai son of Joseph 25 son of Mattathias son of Amos son of Nahum son of Esli son of Naggai 26 son of Maath son of Mattathias son of Semein son of Josech son of Joda 27 son of Joanan son of Rhesa son of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel son of Neri 28 son of Melchi son of Addi son of Cosam son of Elmadam son of Er 29 son of Jesus son of Eliezer son of Jorim son of Matthat son of Levi 30 son of Symeon son of Judas son of Joseph son of Jonam son of Eliakim 31 son of Melea son of Menna son of Mattatha son of Nathan son of David 32 son of Jesse son of Obed son of Boaz son of Salmon son of Nahshon 33 son of Amminadab son of Arni son of Hezron son of Perez son of Judah 34 son of Jacob son of Isaac son of Abraham son of Terah son of Nahor 35 son of Serug son of Reu son of Peleg son of Eber son of Shelah 36 son of Cainan son of Arpachshad son of Shem son of Noah son of Lamech 37 son of Methuselah son of Enoch son of Jared son of Mahalaleel son of Cainan 38 son of Enosh son of Seth son of Adam son of God
