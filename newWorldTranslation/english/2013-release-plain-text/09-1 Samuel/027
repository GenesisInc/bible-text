1 However David said in his heart One day I will perish by Sauls hand The best thing for me is to escape to the land of the Philistines then Saul will give up looking for me in all the territory of Israel and I will escape from his hand 2 So David rose up with the 600 men who were with him and went over to Achish the son of Maoch the king of Gath 3 David stayed with Achish in Gath he and his men each man with his household With David were his two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the Carmelite Nabals widow 4 When report was made to Saul that David had run away to Gath he stopped searching for him
5 Then David said to Achish If I have found favor in your eyes let them give me a place in one of the cities of the countryside so that I may live there Why should your servant live in the royal city with you 6 So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day That is why Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah down to this day
7 The length of time that David lived in the countryside of the Philistines was a year and four months 8 David would go up with his men to raid the Geshurites the Girzites and the Amalekites for they were inhabiting the land that extended from Telam as far as Shur and down to the land of Egypt 9 When David would attack the land he preserved neither man nor woman alive but he took the flocks herds donkeys camels and clothing after which he would return to Achish 10 Then Achish would ask Where did you make a raid today David would reply Against the south of Judah or Against the south of the Jerahmeelites or Against the south of the Kenites 11 David did not spare alive any man or woman to be brought to Gath saying That they may not tell them about us and say This is what David did And that was his practice the whole time he lived in the countryside of the Philistines 12 So Achish believed David saying to himself He has certainly become a stench among his people Israel so he will always be my servant
