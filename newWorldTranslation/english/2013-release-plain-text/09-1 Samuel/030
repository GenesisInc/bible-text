1 When David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day the Amalekites had made a raid on the south and on Ziklag and they had attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire 2 They had taken captive the women and all who were in it from the smallest to the greatest They had not killed anyone but they had carried them off and gone on their way 3 When David and his men came to the city they found it burned down and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been carried off captive 4 So David and the men with him began weeping loudly until they had no strength left to weep 5 Davids two wives had also been carried off captive Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite 6 David was very distressed because the men were talking of stoning him for all the men had become very bitter over the loss of their sons and daughters But David strengthened himself by Jehovah his God
7 David then said to Abiathar the priest the son of Ahimelech Please bring the ephod here So Abiathar brought the ephod to David 8 David inquired of Jehovah Should I chase after this marauder band Will I overtake them At this He said to him Go in pursuit for you will certainly overtake them and you will make the rescue
9 David immediately set out with the 600 men who were with him and they went on as far as the Wadi Besor where some of the men stayed behind 10 David kept up the chase with 400 men but the 200 men who were too tired to cross the Wadi Besor stayed behind
11 They found an Egyptian man in the field and took him to David They gave him food to eat and water to drink 12 as well as a slice of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins After he ate he regained his strength for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights 13 David now asked him To whom do you belong and where are you from to which he said I am an Egyptian attendant a slave of an Amalekite man but my master left me because I got sick three days ago 14 We made a raid on the south of the Cherethites and on the territory of Judah and on the south of Caleb and Ziklag we burned with fire 15 At this David said to him Will you lead me down to this marauder band He replied If you swear to me by God that you will not put me to death and that you will not hand me over to my master I will lead you down to this marauder band
16 So he led him down to where they were spread out all over the land eating and drinking and celebrating because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah 17 Then David struck them down from the morning darkness until the following evening not a man escaped except 400 men who fled on camels 18 David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken and David rescued his two wives 19 Nothing of theirs was missing from the smallest to the greatest They recovered their sons and daughters and the spoil David recovered everything that they had taken 20 So David took all the flocks and the herds which they drove before their own livestock They said This is Davids spoil
21 Then David came to the 200 men who had been too tired to go along with David and who had stayed behind by the Wadi Besor and they came out to meet David and the people with him When David came near to the men he asked them how they were 22 However every bad and worthless man among those who had gone with David said Since they did not go with us we will not give them any of the spoil that we recovered except that each one may take his wife and his sons and go away 23 But David said You must not do this my brothers with what Jehovah has given us He protected us and gave into our hand the marauder band that came against us 24 Who would agree with you on this The share of the one who went down into the battle will be the same as the share of the one who sat by the baggage All will have a share together 25 And from that day forward he kept it set as a regulation and a rule for Israel down to this day
26 When David returned to Ziklag he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah who were his friends saying Here is a gift for you from the spoil of Jehovahs enemies 27 He sent it to those who were in Bethel to those in Ramoth of the Negeb to those in Jattir 28 to those in Aroer to those in Siphmoth to those in Eshtemoa 29 to those in Racal to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites to those in the cities of the Kenites 30 to those in Hormah to those in Borashan to those in Athach 31 to those in Hebron and to all the places that David and his men had frequented
