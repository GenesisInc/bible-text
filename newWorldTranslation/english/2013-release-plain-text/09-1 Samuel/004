1 And the word of Samuel went out to all Israel
Then Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle they camped beside Ebenezer and the Philistines were encamped at Aphek 2 The Philistines drew up in battle formation to meet Israel but the battle went badly and Israel was defeated by the Philistines who struck down about 4000 men from the battle line in the field 3 When the people returned to the camp the elders of Israel said Why did Jehovah allow us to be defeated today by the Philistines Let us take the ark of Jehovahs covenant with us from Shiloh so that it may be with us and save us from the hand of our enemies 4 So the people sent men to Shiloh and they carried from there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of armies who sits enthroned above the cherubs The two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were also there with the ark of the covenant of the true God
5 As soon as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp all the Israelites broke out into loud shouting so that the earth shook 6 When the Philistines heard the sound of the shouting they said Why is there such loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews Finally they learned that the Ark of Jehovah had come into the camp 7 The Philistines became afraid for they said God has come into the camp So they said Too bad for us for nothing like this has ever happened before 8 Too bad for us Who will save us from the hand of this majestic God This is the God who struck Egypt with every sort of slaughter in the wilderness 9 Be courageous and act like men you Philistines so that you may not serve the Hebrews just as they have served you Act like men and fight 10 So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated and each one fled to his tent The slaughter was very great on Israels side 30000 foot soldiers fell 11 Moreover the Ark of God was captured and the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas died
12 A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and arrived at Shiloh on that day with his garments ripped apart and dirt on his head 13 When the man arrived Eli was sitting on the seat by the roadside watching because his heart was trembling over the Ark of the true God The man went into the city to report the news and the whole city began crying out 14 When Eli heard the sound of the outcry he asked What does the sound of this turmoil mean The same man hurried in and reported the news to Eli 15 Now Eli was 98 years old and his eyes stared straight ahead and he could not see 16 Then the man said to Eli I am the one who came from the battle line Just today I fled from the battle line At this he asked What happened my son 17 So the bearer of the news related Israel has fled from the Philistines and there was a great defeat among the people also your own two sons Hophni and Phinehas have died and the Ark of the true God has been captured
18 At the moment he mentioned the Ark of the true God Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate and his neck was broken and he died for he was old and heavy He had judged Israel for 40 years 19 His daughter-in-law the wife of Phinehas was pregnant and close to giving birth When she heard the report that the Ark of the true God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband had died she doubled over and unexpectedly went into labor and gave birth 20 As she was dying the women standing by her said Do not be afraid for you have given birth to a son She did not answer and did not pay attention to it 21 But she named the boy Ichabod saying Glory has gone away from Israel into exile  referring to the capture of the Ark of the true God and what happened to her father-in-law and her husband 22 She said Glory has gone away from Israel into exile because the Ark of the true God has been captured
