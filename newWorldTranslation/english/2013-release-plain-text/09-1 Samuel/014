1 One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the attendant carrying his weapons Come and let us cross over to the Philistine outpost on the other side But he did not tell his father 2 Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree in Migron and there were about 600 men with him 3 And Ahijah the son of Ahitub the brother of Ichabod the son of Phinehas the son of Eli the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh was carrying the ephod And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone 4 Now between the passages that Jonathan was trying to cross over to reach the outpost of the Philistines there was a toothlike crag on one side and a toothlike crag on the other side the name of the one was Bozez and the name of the other was Seneh 5 The one crag was a pillar on the north facing Michmash and the other was on the south facing Geba
6 So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer Come and let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men Perhaps Jehovah will act in our behalf for nothing can hinder Jehovah from saving by many or by few 7 At this his armor-bearer said to him Do whatever your heart impels you to do Turn wherever you wish and I will follow you wherever your heart impels you 8 Then Jonathan said We will cross over to those men and reveal our presence to them 9 If they say to us Stand still until we come to you we will stand where we are and not go up to them 10 But if they say Come up against us we will go up because Jehovah will give them into our hand This will be our sign
11 Then both of them revealed their presence to the outpost of the Philistines The Philistines said Look The Hebrews are coming out from the holes where they have been hiding 12 So the men of the outpost said to Jonathan and his armor-bearer Come up to us and we will teach you a lesson At once Jonathan said to his armor-bearer Follow me for Jehovah will give them into the hand of Israel 13 And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet and his armor-bearer was behind him and the Philistines began to fall before Jonathan and his armor-bearer was putting them to death behind him 14 In the first attack that Jonathan and his armor-bearer made they struck down about 20 men within about half the plowing line in an acre of field
15 Then terror spread in the field camp and among all the people of the outpost and even the raiding parties were terrified The earth began quaking and a terror from God ensued 16 Sauls watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin saw that the turmoil was spreading in every direction
17 Saul said to the people with him Take a count please and see who has left us When they took the count they saw that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there 18 Saul now said to Ahijah Bring the Ark of the true God near For the Ark of the true God was with the Israelites at that time 19 And while Saul was speaking to the priest the turmoil in the camp of the Philistines was growing greater and greater Then Saul said to the priest Stop what you are doing 20 So Saul and all the people with him assembled and went into the battle where they found that the Philistines had turned their swords against one another and the confusion was very great 21 Also the Hebrews who had previously sided with the Philistines and who had come up with them into the camp were going over to Israel under Saul and Jonathan 22 All the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountainous region of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled and they too joined in pursuing them in the battle 23 So Jehovah saved Israel on that day and the battle extended as far as Beth-aven
24 But the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day for Saul had put the people under this oath Cursed is the man who eats any food before the evening and until I have taken vengeance on my enemies So none of the people ate any food
25 And all the people came into the forest and there was honey on the ground 26 When the people came into the forest they saw the honey dripping but no one would put his hand to his mouth because they feared the oath 27 But Jonathan had not heard his father put the people under an oath so he stretched out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb When he drew his hand back to his mouth his eyes brightened 28 At this one of the people said Your father put the people under a strict oath saying Cursed is the man who eats food today That is why the people are so tired 29 However Jonathan said My father has brought great trouble on the land Look at how my eyes brightened because I tasted this little bit of honey 30 How much better if the people had eaten freely today from the spoil of their enemies that they found For then the slaughter of the Philistines would have been even greater
31 On that day they kept striking down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon and the people became very tired 32 So the people began rushing greedily at the spoil and they took sheep and cattle and calves and slaughtered them on the ground and they ate the meat along with the blood 33 So it was reported to Saul Look The people are sinning against Jehovah by eating meat with the blood At this he said You have acted faithlessly Roll a large stone to me immediately 34 Saul then said Spread out among the people and say to them Each of you must bring his bull and his sheep and slaughter them here and then eat them Do not sin against Jehovah by eating meat with the blood So each of them brought his bull with him that night and slaughtered it there 35 And Saul built an altar to Jehovah This was the first altar he built to Jehovah
36 Saul later said Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light We will not leave a single survivor To this they said Do whatever seems good in your eyes Then the priest said Let us approach the true God here 37 And Saul inquired of God Should I go down after the Philistines Will you give them into the hand of Israel But God did not answer him on that day 38 So Saul said Come here all you chiefs of the people and find out what sin has been committed today 39 For as surely as Jehovah is alive who rescued Israel even if it turns out to be Jonathan my son he must die But none of the people would answer him 40 Then he said to all Israel You will be on one side and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side At this the people said to Saul Do whatever seems good in your eyes
41 Saul then said to Jehovah O God of Israel answer with the Thummim Then Jonathan and Saul were selected and the people went free 42 Saul now said Cast lots to decide between me and my son Jonathan And Jonathan was selected 43 Then Saul said to Jonathan Tell me what have you done So Jonathan told him I merely tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff in my hand Here I am I am ready to die
44 At this Saul said Thus may God do and may he add to it if you do not die Jonathan 45 But the people said to Saul Should Jonathan dieâ€”the one who brought this great victory to Israel It is unthinkable As surely as Jehovah is alive not even a single hair of his head should fall to the ground for it was with God that he acted this day With that the people rescued Jonathan and he did not die
46 So Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines and the Philistines went to their own territory
47 Saul secured the kingship over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against the Moabites the Ammonites the Edomites the kings of Zobah and the Philistines and wherever he went he defeated them 48 And he fought bravely and conquered the Amalekites and rescued Israel from the hand of their plunderers
49 The sons of Saul were Jonathan Ishvi and Malchi-shua And he had two daughters the name of the older one was Merab and the name of the younger one Michal 50 The name of Sauls wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz The name of the chief of his army was Abner the son of Ner the uncle of Saul 51 Kish was the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel
52 There was fierce warfare with the Philistines all the days of Saul When Saul saw any strong or courageous man he would recruit him into his service
