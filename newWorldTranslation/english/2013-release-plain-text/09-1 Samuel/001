1 Now there was a man of Ramathaim-zophim of the mountainous region of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham the son of Elihu the son of Tohu the son of Zuph an Ephraimite 2 He had two wives one was named Hannah and the other was named Peninnah Peninnah had children but Hannah had no children 3 That man went up from his city year after year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of armies in Shiloh That is where the two sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas served as priests to Jehovah
4 One day when Elkanah offered a sacrifice he gave portions to his wife Peninnah as well as to all her sons and her daughters 5 but to Hannah he gave a special portion because Hannah was the one he loved but Jehovah had not given her children 6 Moreover her rival wife taunted her relentlessly in order to upset her because Jehovah had not given her children 7 That is what she would do year after year whenever Hannah went up to the house of Jehovah her rival would taunt her so much that she would weep and not eat 8 But her husband Elkanah said to her Hannah why do you weep and why do you not eat and why are you so sad Am I not better to you than ten sons
9 Then Hannah got up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh At the time Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of Jehovah 10 Hannah was extremely bitter and she began to pray to Jehovah and to weep uncontrollably 11 And she made this vow O Jehovah of armies if you look upon the affliction of your servant and remember me and you do not forget your servant and give to your servant a male child I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life and no razor will touch his head
12 While she prayed for a long time before Jehovah Eli was watching her mouth 13 Hannah was speaking in her heart only her lips were trembling but her voice was not heard So Eli thought she was drunk 14 Eli said to her How long will you stay drunk Stop drinking your wine 15 At this Hannah answered No my lord I am a woman under great stress I have not drunk wine or anything alcoholic but I am pouring out my soul before Jehovah 16 Do not take your servant for a worthless woman for I have been speaking until now out of my great anguish and distress 17 Then Eli answered Go in peace and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him 18 To this she said Let your servant find favor in your eyes And the woman went on her way and ate and her face was no longer downcast
19 Then they got up early in the morning and bowed before Jehovah after which they returned to their house in Ramah Elkanah had sexual relations with his wife Hannah and Jehovah gave attention to her 20 Within a year Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son and named him Samuel because as she said it is from Jehovah that I have asked him
21 In time Elkanah went up with all his household to offer the yearly sacrifice to Jehovah and to present his vow offering 22 But Hannah did not go up for she said to her husband As soon as the boy is weaned I will bring him then he will appear before Jehovah and remain there from then on 23 Elkanah her husband then said to her Do what you think is best Stay at home until you wean him May Jehovah carry out what you have said So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she weaned him
24 As soon as she had weaned him she took him up to Shiloh along with a three-year-old bull one ephah of flour and a large jar of wine and she came to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh and brought the young boy with her 25 Then they slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to Eli 26 With that she said Pardon me my lord As surely as you live my lord I am the woman who was standing with you in this place to pray to Jehovah 27 It was for this boy that I prayed and Jehovah granted my petition that I asked of him 28 I in turn now lend him to Jehovah For all his days he is lent to Jehovah
And he bowed down there to Jehovah
