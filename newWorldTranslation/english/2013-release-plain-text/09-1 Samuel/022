1 So David went from there escaping to the cave of Adullam When his brothers and his fathers entire house heard of it they went down there to him 2 And all those who were in trouble and in debt and who had a grievance gathered to him and he became their chief There were about 400 men with him
3 David later went from there to Mizpeh in Moab and said to the king of Moab Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me 4 So he left them with the king of Moab and they stayed with him the whole time that David was in the stronghold
5 In time Gad the prophet said to David Do not stay in the stronghold Go from there into the land of Judah So David left and went into the forest of Hereth
6 Saul heard that David and the men with him had been found Saul was then sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the high place with his spear in his hand and all his servants were stationed around him 7 Then Saul said to his servants stationed around him Listen please you Benjaminites Will the son of Jesse also give fields and vineyards to all of you Will he appoint all of you as chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds 8 All of you have conspired against me No one informed me when my own son made a covenant with the son of Jesse Not one of you has sympathy for me and informs me that my own son has incited my own servant against me to ambush me as is now the case
9 Then Doeg the Edomite who was stationed there over the servants of Saul answered I saw the son of Jesse come to Nob to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub 10 And he inquired of Jehovah for him and gave him provisions He even gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine 11 At once the king sent for Ahimelech son of Ahitub the priest and all the priests of his fathers house who were in Nob So all of them came to the king
12 Saul now said Listen please you son of Ahitub to which he replied Here I am my lord 13 Saul said to him Why have you conspired against me you and the son of Jesse by giving him bread and a sword and by making an inquiry of God for him He opposes me and waits in ambush as is now the case 14 At this Ahimelech answered the king Who among all your servants is as trustworthy as David He is the kings son-in-law and a chief over your bodyguard and honored in your house 15 Was today the first time I inquired of God for him What you are saying is unthinkable on my part Do not let the king hold anything against his servant and against my fathers entire house for your servant did not know a single thing about any of this
16 But the king said You will surely die Ahimelech you along with all your fathers house 17 With that the king said to the guards stationed around him Turn and kill the priests of Jehovah because they have sided with David They knew that he was a runaway and they did not inform me But the kings servants did not want to lift their hands to assault the priests of Jehovah 18 Then the king said to Doeg You turn and assault the priests Immediately Doeg the Edomite went and assaulted the priests himself He killed on that day 85 men wearing the linen ephod 19 He also struck Nob the city of the priests with the sword man as well as woman child as well as infant bull donkey and sheep he put to the sword
20 However one son of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub whose name was Abiathar escaped and ran away to follow David 21 Abiathar told David Saul has killed the priests of Jehovah 22 At this David said to Abiathar I knew on that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would be sure to tell Saul I am personally responsible for the death of everyone in your fathers house 23 Stay with me Do not be afraid for whoever seeks your life seeks my life you are under my protection
