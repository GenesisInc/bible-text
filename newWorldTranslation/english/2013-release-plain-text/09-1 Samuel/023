1 In time David was told The Philistines are fighting against Keilah and they are raiding the threshing floors 2 So David inquired of Jehovah Should I go and strike down these Philistines Jehovah said to David Go strike down the Philistines and rescue Keilah 3 But the men of David said to him Look We are afraid while here in Judah how much more so if we go to Keilah against the battle line of the Philistines 4 So David inquired once again of Jehovah Jehovah now answered him Rise up go down to Keilah because I will give the Philistines into your hand 5 So David went with his men to Keilah and fought against the Philistines he carried off their livestock and struck them down with a great slaughter and David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah
6 Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech ran away to David at Keilah he had an ephod with him 7 Saul was told David has come to Keilah Then Saul said God has handed him over to me for he has trapped himself by entering a city with gates and bars 8 So Saul summoned all the people to war to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men 9 When David learned that Saul was plotting against him he said to Abiathar the priest Bring the ephod here 10 Then David said O Jehovah the God of Israel your servant has indeed heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me 11 Will the leaders of Keilah surrender me into his hand Will Saul come down as your servant has heard O Jehovah the God of Israel please tell your servant To this Jehovah said He will come down 12 David asked Will the leaders of Keilah surrender me and my men into Sauls hand Jehovah replied They will surrender you
13 At once David rose up with his men about 600 in number and they left Keilah and moved about wherever they could When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah he did not go out after him 14 David stayed in the wilderness in places difficult to approach in the mountainous region of the wilderness of Ziph Saul searched for him constantly but Jehovah did not give him into his hand 15 David was aware that Saul had gone out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh
16 Jonathan the son of Saul now went out to David at Horesh and he helped him find strength in Jehovah 17 He said to him Do not be afraid for my father Saul will not find you you will be king over Israel and I will become second to you and my father Saul also knows that 18 Then the two of them made a covenant before Jehovah and David stayed in Horesh and Jonathan went to his home
19 The men of Ziph later went up to Saul at Gibeah and said Is not David hiding near us in the places difficult to approach at Horesh on the hill of Hachilah which is south of Jeshimon 20 Whenever it pleases you to come down O king come and we will surrender him into the hand of the king 21 At this Saul said May you be blessed by Jehovah for you have shown compassion to me 22 Please go and try to find out exactly where he is and who saw him there for I have been told that he is very cunning 23 Carefully ascertain where all his hiding places are and return to me with the evidence I will then go with you and if he is in the land I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah
24 So they left and went to Ziph ahead of Saul while David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon 25 Then Saul came with his men to look for him When David was told he at once went down to the crag and stayed in the wilderness of Maon When Saul heard this he chased after David into the wilderness of Maon 26 As Saul came to one side of the mountain David and his men were on the other side of the mountain David was hurrying to get away from Saul but Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them 27 But a messenger came to Saul saying Come quickly for the Philistines have made a raid on the land 28 At that Saul stopped chasing after David and went to confront the Philistines That is why that place was named the Crag of the Divisions
29 Then David made his way up from there and stayed in the places difficult to approach at En-gedi
