1 Saul later spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants about putting David to death 2 Since Sauls son Jonathan was very fond of David Jonathan told David My father Saul wants to have you put to death Please be on your guard in the morning and go to a secret place and remain hidden 3 I will go out and stand next to my father in the field where you will be I will talk about you to my father and if I learn anything I will be sure to tell you
4 So Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul He said to him The king should not sin against his servant David for he has not sinned against you and what he has done for you has benefited you 5 He risked his life to strike down the Philistine so that Jehovah brought about a great victory for all Israel You saw it and you were overjoyed So why should you sin against innocent blood in having David put to death for no reason 6 Saul listened to Jonathan and Saul swore As surely as Jehovah is living he will not be put to death 7 Afterward Jonathan called David and told him all these things So Jonathan brought David to Saul and he continued to serve him as before
8 In time war broke out again and David went out and fought against the Philistines and struck them down with a great slaughter and they fled from before him
9 And a bad spirit from Jehovah came upon Saul when he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand while David was playing music on the harp 10 Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear but he eluded Saul who drove the spear into the wall David fled and escaped during that night 11 Saul later sent messengers to Davids house to watch it and to kill him in the morning but Davids wife Michal told him If you do not escape tonight tomorrow you will be a dead man 12 Immediately Michal let David down through the window so that he could run away and escape 13 Michal took the teraphim statue and placed it on the bed and she put a net of goat hair at the place of his head and she covered it with a garment
14 Saul now sent messengers to take David but she said He is sick 15 So Saul sent the messengers to see David and told them Bring him to me on his bed to have him put to death 16 When the messengers came in there was the teraphim statue on the bed and a net of goat hair where his head would have been 17 Saul said to Michal Why did you trick me like this and send my enemy away so that he could escape Michal replied to Saul He said to me Send me away or I will kill you
18 Now David had run away and escaped and he came to Samuel at Ramah He told him all that Saul had done to him Then he and Samuel went away and they stayed in Naioth 19 In time it was reported to Saul Look David is in Naioth in Ramah 20 At once Saul sent messengers to seize David When they saw the elderly ones of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing and presiding over them the spirit of God came to be upon Sauls messengers and they began behaving as prophets as well
21 When they told it to Saul he immediately sent other messengers and they too began behaving as prophets So Saul sent messengers again a third group and they too began behaving as prophets 22 Finally he also went to Ramah When he reached the great cistern that is in Secu he asked Where are Samuel and David They replied There in Naioth in Ramah 23 While Saul was on his way from there to Naioth in Ramah the spirit of God came upon him as well and he walked along behaving as a prophet until he came into Naioth in Ramah 24 He also stripped off his garments and he too behaved as a prophet before Samuel and he lay there naked all that day and all that night That is why they say Is Saul also among the prophets
