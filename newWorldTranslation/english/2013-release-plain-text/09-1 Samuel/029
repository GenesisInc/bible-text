1 The Philistines assembled all their armies at Aphek while the Israelites were camping by the spring in Jezreel 2 And the lords of the Philistines were passing by with their hundreds and their thousands and David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish 3 But the princes of the Philistines said Why are these Hebrews here Achish replied to the princes of the Philistines This is David the servant of King Saul of Israel who has been with me for a year or more I have not found any fault in him from the day he deserted to me until today 4 But the princes of the Philistines became indignant at him and they said to him Make the man go back Let him return to the place where you assigned him Do not let him go down with us into the battle so that he will not turn against us during the battle For what better way to put himself in favor with his lord than with the heads of our men 5 Is this not the David about whom they sang when they danced saying
Saul has struck down his thousands And David his tens of thousands
6 So Achish summoned David and said to him As surely as Jehovah is living you are upright and I am pleased to have you go on the campaign with my army for I have not found any fault with you from the day you came to me until today But the lords do not trust you 7 So return in peace and do not do anything to displease the lords of the Philistines 8 However David said to Achish Why what have I done What fault have you found in your servant from the day that I came to you until today Why should I not come with you and fight against the enemies of my lord the king 9 Achish answered David From my standpoint you have been as good as an angel of God But the princes of the Philistines have said Do not let him go up with us into the battle 10 Now get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you rise up and leave early in the morning as soon as it is light
11 So David and his men rose up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines and the Philistines went up to Jezreel
