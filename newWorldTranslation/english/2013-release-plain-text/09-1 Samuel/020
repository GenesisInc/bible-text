1 Then David ran away from Naioth in Ramah However he came to Jonathan and said What have I done What is my offense and how have I sinned against your father for him to seek my life 2 At this Jonathan said to him It is unthinkable You will not die Look My father will not do anything great or small without disclosing it to me Why should my father hide this matter from me This will not happen 3 But David swore further and said Your father surely knows that I have found favor in your eyes and would say Do not let Jonathan know this or he will be upset But as surely as Jehovah is living and as surely as you are living there is only a step between me and death
4 Then Jonathan said to David Whatever you say I will do for you 5 David said to Jonathan Tomorrow is the new moon and I am certainly expected to sit with the king to eat you must send me away and I will hide in the field until the evening on the third day 6 If your father misses me at all then say David begged me for permission to go quickly to his city Bethlehem because there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family 7 If his response is That is fine  it means peace to your servant But if he becomes angry you can be sure that he is determined to harm me 8 Show loyal love to your servant for you have brought your servant into Jehovahs covenant with you But if I am guilty put me to death yourself Why turn me over to your father
9 To this Jonathan said It is unthinkable to suggest that about you If I learn that my father is determined to harm you would I not tell you 10 Then David said to Jonathan Who will tell me whether your father gives you a harsh answer 11 Jonathan said to David Come let us go out into the field So both of them went out into the field 12 And Jonathan said to David Let Jehovah the God of Israel be a witness that I will sound out my father about this time tomorrow or by the third day If he is favorably disposed toward David will I not then send you word and disclose it to you 13 But if my father intends to harm you may Jehovah do that and more to Jonathan if I do not disclose it to you and send you away in peace May Jehovah be with you just as he was with my father 14 And will you not show me the loyal love of Jehovah while I am alive and even when I die 15 Never withdraw your loyal love from my household even when Jehovah wipes out all the enemies of David from the face of the earth 16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David saying Jehovah will require it and call Davids enemies to account 17 So Jonathan had David swear again by his love for him for he loved him as he loved himself
18 Jonathan then said to him Tomorrow is the new moon and you will be missed for your seat will be vacant 19 By the third day you will be missed even more and you must go to the place where you hid the other day and stay near the stone here 20 I will then shoot three arrows to one side of it as though I were shooting at a target 21 When I send the attendant I will say Go find the arrows If I say to the attendant Look The arrows are on this side of you get them  then you may come back for as surely as Jehovah is living it means everything is peaceful for you and there is no danger 22 But if I should say to the boy Look The arrows are beyond you  then go for Jehovah has sent you away 23 As for the promise that we have made you and I may Jehovah be between us forever
24 So David hid in the field When the new moon came the king took his seat at the meal to eat 25 The king was sitting in his usual seat by the wall Jonathan was facing him and Abner was sitting at Sauls side but Davids place was vacant 26 Saul did not say anything that day for he said to himself Something has happened so that he is not clean Yes he must be unclean 27 And the day after the new moon on the second day Davids place continued vacant Saul then said to Jonathan his son Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal either yesterday or today 28 Jonathan answered Saul David begged me for permission to go to Bethlehem 29 He said Please permit me to go because we have a family sacrifice in the city and my own brother summoned me So if I have found favor in your eyes please let me slip away to see my brothers That is why he has not come to the kings table 30 Then Saul became enraged with Jonathan and he said to him You son of a rebellious woman do you think I do not know that you are choosing to side with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother 31 As long as the son of Jesse is alive on the earth you and your kingship will not be firmly established So now send someone to bring him to me for he must die
32 However Jonathan said to Saul his father Why should he be put to death What has he done 33 At that Saul hurled the spear at him to strike him so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death 34 Jonathan immediately rose up from the table in the heat of anger and he did not eat any food on the second day after the new moon for he was upset over David and his own father had humiliated him
35 In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointment with David and a young attendant was with him 36 And he said to his attendant Please run and find the arrows that I shoot The attendant ran and Jonathan shot the arrow beyond him 37 When the attendant reached the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow Jonathan called out to the attendant Is not the arrow beyond you 38 Jonathan called out to the attendant Hurry Go quickly Do not delay And Jonathans attendant picked up the arrows and came back to his master 39 The attendant did not understand anything about the matter only Jonathan and David knew what was meant 40 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his attendant and told him Go take them to the city
41 When the attendant left David rose up from a place nearby that was to the south Then he fell with his face to the ground and bowed three times and they kissed each other and wept for each other but David wept the most 42 Jonathan said to David Go in peace since we have both sworn in the name of Jehovah saying May Jehovah be between you and me and between your offspring and my offspring forever
Then David rose up and left and Jonathan went back to the city
