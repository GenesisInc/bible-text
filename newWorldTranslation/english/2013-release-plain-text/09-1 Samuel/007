1 So the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the Ark of Jehovah up into the house of Abinadab on the hill and they sanctified his son Eleazar to guard the Ark of Jehovah
2 A long time elapsed 20 years in all from the day of the Arks coming to Kiriath-jearim and all the house of Israel began to seek after Jehovah 3 Samuel then said to all the house of Israel If you are returning to Jehovah with all your heart put away the foreign gods and the Ashtoreth images from among you and direct your heart unswervingly to Jehovah and serve only him and he will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines 4 At that the Israelites got rid of the Baals and the Ashtoreth images and served only Jehovah
5 Then Samuel said Gather all Israel together at Mizpah and I will pray to Jehovah in your behalf 6 So they gathered together at Mizpah and they drew water and poured it out before Jehovah and kept a fast on that day There they said We have sinned against Jehovah And Samuel began serving as judge over the Israelites in Mizpah
7 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered together at Mizpah the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel When the Israelites heard of it they were afraid because of the Philistines 8 So the Israelites said to Samuel Do not stop calling to Jehovah our God to help us and to save us from the hand of the Philistines 9 Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah and Samuel called to Jehovah for help in behalf of Israel and Jehovah answered him 10 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering the Philistines advanced for battle against Israel Jehovah now caused it to thunder loudly on that day against the Philistines and He threw them into confusion and they were defeated before Israel 11 At that the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines striking them down as far as south of Beth-car 12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Jeshanah and named it Ebenezer for he said Until now Jehovah has helped us 13 Thus the Philistines were subdued and they did not come again into the territory of Israel and the hand of Jehovah continued against the Philistines all the days of Samuel 14 Also the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were returned to Israel from Ekron to Gath and Israel recovered their territory from the hand of the Philistines
There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites
15 Samuel kept on judging Israel throughout his life 16 Each year he traveled in a circuit to Bethel Gilgal and Mizpah and he judged Israel in all these places 17 But he would return to Ramah because his house was there and there he also judged Israel He built an altar there to Jehovah
