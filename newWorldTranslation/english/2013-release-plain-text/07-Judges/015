1 After a while in the days of the wheat harvest Samson went to visit his wife bringing a young goat He said I wish to go in to my wife in the bedroom But her father did not allow him to go in 2 Her father said I thought You must surely hate her So I gave her to your groomsman Is not her younger sister more attractive than she is Please take her instead 3 However Samson said to them This time I cannot be blamed by the Philistines for harming them
4 So Samson went and caught 300 foxes Then he took torches turned the foxes tail to tail and put one torch between each pair of tails 5 Then he set fire to the torches and sent the foxes out into the fields of standing grain of the Philistines He set on fire everything from sheaf to standing grain as well as the vineyards and the olive groves
6 The Philistines asked Who did this They were told It was Samson the son-in-law of the Timnite because he took his wife and gave her to his groomsman At that the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire 7 Then Samson said to them If this is how you act I will not quit until I take revenge on you 8 Then he struck them down one after the other with a great slaughter after which he went down and stayed in a cave of the crag Etam
9 Later the Philistines came up and camped in Judah and were tramping about in Lehi 10 Then the men of Judah said Why have you come up against us to which they answered We have come up to capture Samson to do to him just as he did to us 11 So 3000 men of Judah went down to the cave of the crag Etam and said to Samson Do you not know that the Philistines are ruling over us So why have you done this to us He said to them As they did to me so I did to them 12 But they said to him We have come to capture you and to hand you over to the Philistines Then Samson said Swear to me that you yourselves will not assault me 13 They said to him No we will only tie you and hand you over to them but we will not put you to death
So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the crag 14 When he came to Lehi the Philistines shouted triumphantly at meeting him Then Jehovahs spirit empowered him and the ropes on his arms became like linen threads that were scorched with fire and his fetters melted off his hands 15 He now found a fresh jawbone of a male donkey he reached out and grabbed it and struck down 1000 men with it 16 Then Samson said
With the jawbone of a donkeyâ€”one heap two heaps
With the jawbone of a donkey I struck down 1000 men
17 When he finished speaking he threw the jawbone away and called that place Ramath-lehi 18 Then he became very thirsty and he called on Jehovah and said It was you who gave this great salvation into the hand of your servant But now am I to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised 19 So God split open a hollow that was in Lehi and water flowed from it When he drank his spirit returned and he revived That is why he named the place En-hakkore which is in Lehi to this day
20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines for 20 years
