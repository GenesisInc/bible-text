1 Again the Israelites did what was bad in Jehovahs eyes and Jehovah gave them into the hand of the Philistines for 40 years
2 Meanwhile there was a man of Zorah of the family of the Danites whose name was Manoah His wife was barren and childless 3 In time Jehovahs angel appeared to the woman and said to her Look you are barren and childless But you will conceive and give birth to a son 4 Now be careful not to drink wine or anything alcoholic and do not eat anything unclean 5 Look You will conceive and give birth to a son and no razor should touch his head because the child will be a Nazirite of God from birth and he will take the lead in saving Israel out of the hand of the Philistines
6 Then the woman went and told her husband A man of the true God came to me and his appearance was like an angel of the true God very awe-inspiring I did not ask him where he was from nor did he tell me his name 7 But he said to me Look You will conceive and give birth to a son Now do not drink wine or anything alcoholic and do not eat anything unclean because the child will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death
8 Manoah pleaded with Jehovah and said Pardon me Jehovah Please let the man of the true God whom you just sent come again to instruct us about what we should do with the child who will be born 9 So the true God listened to Manoah and the angel of the true God came again to the woman while she was sitting in the field her husband Manoah was not with her 10 The woman quickly ran and told her husband Look The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me
11 Then Manoah got up and went with his wife He came to the man and said to him Are you the man who spoke to my wife He said I am 12 Then Manoah said May your words come true What will be the childs manner of life and what will be his work 13 So Jehovahs angel said to Manoah Your wife should keep herself from everything that I mentioned to her 14 She should not eat anything that the grapevine produces she should not drink wine or anything alcoholic and she should not eat anything unclean Everything that I commanded her let her observe
15 Manoah now said to Jehovahs angel Please stay and let us prepare a young goat for you 16 But Jehovahs angel said to Manoah If I stay I will not eat your food but if you wish to present a burnt offering to Jehovah you may offer it up Manoah did not know that he was Jehovahs angel 17 Then Manoah said to Jehovahs angel What is your name so that we may honor you when your word comes true 18 However Jehovahs angel said to him Why are you asking about my name seeing that it is a wonderful one
19 Then Manoah took the young goat and the grain offering and offered them on the rock to Jehovah And He was doing something amazing while Manoah and his wife were looking on 20 As the flame ascended from the altar heavenward Jehovahs angel ascended in the flame from the altar while Manoah and his wife were looking on At once they fell with their faces to the ground 21 Jehovahs angel did not appear again to Manoah and his wife Then Manoah realized that he was Jehovahs angel 22 Manoah then said to his wife We are sure to die because it is God whom we have seen 23 But his wife said to him If Jehovah wanted to put us to death he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hand he would not have shown us all these things and he would not have told us any of these things
24 The woman later gave birth to a son and named him Samson and as the boy grew Jehovah continued to bless him 25 In time Jehovahs spirit started to impel him in Mahaneh-dan between Zorah and Eshtaol
