1 These are the nations that Jehovah allowed to remain so that they could test all those of Israel who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan 2 this was so that succeeding generations of Israelites would experience war those who had not experienced such things before 3 the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites the Sidonians and the Hivites inhabiting Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath 4 They served as a means of testing Israel to determine whether Israel would obey Jehovahs commandments that he had given their fathers through Moses 5 So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites the Hittites the Amorites the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites 6 They would take their daughters as wives and their own daughters they gave to their sons and they began serving their gods
7 So the Israelites did what was bad in Jehovahs eyes and they forgot Jehovah their God and were serving the Baals and the sacred poles 8 At this Jehovahs anger blazed against Israel and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim the king of Mesopotamia The Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim for eight years 9 When the Israelites called to Jehovah for help Jehovah raised up a savior to rescue the Israelites Othniel the son of Kenaz the younger brother of Caleb 10 The spirit of Jehovah came upon him and he became the judge of Israel When he went out to battle Jehovah gave Cushan-rishathaim the king of Mesopotamia into his hand so that he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim 11 After that the land had rest for 40 years Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died
12 And once again the Israelites began doing what was bad in Jehovahs eyes So Jehovah let Eglon the king of Moab prevail over Israel because they did what was bad in Jehovahs eyes 13 Furthermore he brought against them the Ammonites and the Amalekites They attacked Israel and captured the city of palm trees 14 The Israelites served Eglon the king of Moab for 18 years 15 Then the Israelites called to Jehovah for help so Jehovah raised up for them a savior Ehud the son of Gera a Benjaminite who was left-handed In time the Israelites sent tribute through him to Eglon the king of Moab 16 Meanwhile Ehud made for himself a two-edged sword a cubit long and he strapped it underneath his garment on his right thigh 17 He then presented the tribute to Eglon the king of Moab Now Eglon was a very fat man
18 When Ehud finished presenting the tribute he sent away the people who had carried the tribute 19 But after reaching the carved images at Gilgal he himself went back and said I have a secret message for you O king So the king said Silence With that all his attendants left him 20 So Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber Then Ehud said I have a message from God for you So he rose up from his throne 21 Then Ehud drew the sword from his right thigh with his left hand and plunged it into his belly 22 The handle went in after the blade and the fat closed in over the blade for he did not draw the sword out of his belly and the fecal matter came out 23 Ehud went out through the porch closing the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locking them 24 After he left the servants returned and saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked So they said He must be relieving himself in the cool interior room 25 They kept waiting until they were embarrassed but when they saw that he was still not opening the doors of the roof chamber they took the key and opened them and saw their lord fallen to the floor dead
26 Ehud escaped while they were lingering and he passed by the carved images and made it safely to Seirah 27 When he arrived he sounded the horn in the mountainous region of Ephraim and the Israelites went down out of the mountainous region with him at their head 28 Then he said to them Follow me because Jehovah has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand So they followed him and captured the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and they did not allow anyone to cross 29 At that time they struck down about 10000 Moabites all strong and valiant men not a single one escaped 30 So Moab was subdued on that day under Israels hand and the land had rest for 80 years
31 After him was Shamgar the son of Anath who struck down 600 Philistine men with a cattle goad he too saved Israel
