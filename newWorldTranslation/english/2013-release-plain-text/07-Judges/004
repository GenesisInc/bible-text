1 But after Ehud died the Israelites again did what was bad in Jehovahs eyes 2 So Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin the king of Canaan who reigned in Hazor The chief of his army was Sisera who lived in Harosheth of the nations 3 The Israelites cried out to Jehovah because Jabin had 900 war chariots with iron scythes and he harshly oppressed the Israelites for 20 years
4 Now Deborah a prophetess the wife of Lappidoth was judging Israel at that time 5 She used to sit under Deborahs palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the mountainous region of Ephraim the Israelites would go up to her for judgment 6 She sent for Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali and said to him Has not Jehovah the God of Israel given the command Go and march to Mount Tabor and take 10000 men of Naphtali and Zebulun with you 7 I will bring to you Sisera the chief of Jabins army along with his war chariots and his troops to the stream of Kishon and I will give him into your hand
8 At this Barak said to her If you go with me I will go but if you do not go with me I will not go 9 To this she said I will certainly go with you However the campaign you are going on will not bring you glory for it will be into the hand of a woman that Jehovah will give Sisera Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh 10 Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh and 10000 men followed his steps Deborah also went up with him
11 Incidentally Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites the descendants of Hobab Moses father-in-law and his tent was pitched near the big tree in Zaanannim which is at Kedesh
12 They reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor 13 At once Sisera assembled all his war chariots—900 chariots with iron scythes—and all the troops that were with him from Harosheth of the nations to go to the stream of Kishon 14 Deborah now said to Barak Rise up for this is the day that Jehovah will give Sisera into your hand Is Jehovah not going out before you And Barak descended from Mount Tabor with 10000 men following him 15 Then Jehovah threw Sisera and all his war chariots and all the army into confusion before the sword of Barak Finally Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot 16 Barak chased after the war chariots and the army as far as Harosheth of the nations So Siseras whole army fell by the sword not even one remained
17 But Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite 18 Then Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him Come in my lord come in here Do not be afraid So he went into her tent and she covered him with a blanket 19 Then he said to her Give me please a little water to drink for I am thirsty So she opened a skin bottle of milk and gave him a drink after which she again covered him 20 He told her Stand at the entrance of the tent and if anybody comes and asks you Is there a man here say No
21 But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent pin and a hammer in her hand Then while he was fast asleep and exhausted she stealthily approached him and drove the pin through his temples and beat it into the ground and he died
22 Barak went there in pursuit of Sisera and Jael now came out to meet him and said Come and I will show you the man you are looking for He went in with her and saw Sisera lying dead with the tent pin through his temples
23 So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the Israelites 24 The hand of the Israelites came down harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan until they destroyed Jabin the king of Canaan
