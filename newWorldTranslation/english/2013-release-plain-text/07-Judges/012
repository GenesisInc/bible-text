1 Then the men of Ephraim were summoned and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah Why did you not call us to go with you when you crossed over to fight against the Ammonites We will burn your house down with you in it 2 But Jephthah said to them Along with my people I was engaged in a great conflict with the Ammonites I did call to you for help but you did not save me from their hand 3 When I saw that you would not save me then I decided to risk my life and go against the Ammonites and Jehovah handed them over to me So why have you come today to fight against me
