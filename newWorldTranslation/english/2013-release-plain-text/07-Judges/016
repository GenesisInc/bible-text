1 One time Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute there and he went in to her 2 The Gazites were told Samson has come here So they surrounded him and lay in ambush for him all night long in the city gate They stayed quiet the whole night saying to themselves When daylight comes we will kill him
3 However Samson kept lying there until midnight Then he got up at midnight and grabbed the doors of the city gate and the two side posts and pulled them out along with the bar He put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that faces Hebron
4 After that he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah 5 So the lords of the Philistines approached her and said Trick him and find out what gives him such great strength and how we can overpower him and tie him and subdue him For this we will each give you 1100 silver pieces
6 Delilah later said to Samson Please tell me where your great power comes from and what can be used to tie you and subdue you 7 Samson said to her If they tie me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried out I will grow as weak as an ordinary man 8 So the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried out and she tied him with them 9 Now they set an ambush in the inner room and she called out to him The Philistines are upon you Samson At that he tore apart the bowstrings just as easily as a thread of flax comes apart when it touches fire The secret of his power did not become known
10 Then Delilah said to Samson Look You have fooled me and told me lies Now tell me please what can be used to tie you 11 So he said to her If they tie me up with new ropes that have not been used for work I will grow as weak as an ordinary man 12 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them and called out The Philistines are upon you Samson All the while the ambush was set in the inner room At that he tore them off his arms like threads
13 After that Delilah said to Samson Up until now you have fooled me and told me lies Tell me what can be used to tie you Then he said to her If you weave the seven braids of my head with the warp thread 14 So she fixed them with a pin and called out to him The Philistines are upon you Samson So he woke up from his sleep and pulled out the loom pin and the warp thread
15 She now said to him How can you say I love you  when your heart is not with me These three times you have fooled me and have not told me the source of your great power 16 Because day after day she kept nagging him and pressuring him he was weary to the point of dying 17 So he finally opened his heart to her saying A razor has never touched my head because I am a Nazirite of God from birth If I am shaved my power will leave me and I will grow weak and become like all other men
18 When Delilah saw that he had opened his heart to her she immediately summoned the Philistine lords saying Come up this time for he has opened his heart to me So the Philistine lords came up to her bringing the money with them 19 She made him fall asleep on her knees then she called the man and had him shave off the seven braids of his head After that she began to have control over him for his power was leaving him 20 Now she called out The Philistines are upon you Samson He woke up from his sleep and said I will go out as at other times and shake myself free But he did not know that Jehovah had left him 21 So the Philistines seized him and bored his eyes out Then they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with two copper fetters and he became a grinder of grain in the prison 22 But the hair of his head started to grow back again after he had been shaved
23 The Philistine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate for they were saying Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand 24 When the people saw him they praised their god and said Our god has given into our hand our enemy the one who devastated our land and killed so many of us
25 Because their heart was cheerful they said Call Samson to provide us some amusement So they called Samson out of the prison to entertain them they made him stand between the pillars 26 Then Samson said to the boy holding him by the hand Let me feel the pillars that support the house so that I can lean against them 27 Incidentally the house was full of men and women All the Philistine lords were there and on the roof there were about 3000 men and women who were looking on while Samson provided amusement
28 Samson now called out to Jehovah Sovereign Lord Jehovah remember me please and strengthen me please just this once O God and let me take revenge on the Philistines for one of my two eyes
29 Then Samson braced himself against the two middle pillars that supported the house and he leaned on them with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other 30 Samson called out Let me die with the Philistines Then he pushed with all his might and the house fell on the lords and all the people in it So he killed more at his death than he had killed during his life
31 Later his brothers and all his fathers family came down to take him back They brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father He had judged Israel for 20 years
