1 On that day Deborah along with Barak the son of Abinoam sang this song
 2 Because of the unbound hair in Israel Because of the peoples volunteering Praise Jehovah
 3 Listen you kings Give ear you rulers
To Jehovah I will sing
I will sing praises to Jehovah Israels God
 4 Jehovah when you went out from Seir When you marched out of the territory of Edom The earth shook and the heavens poured The clouds poured down water
 5 Mountains melted before the face of Jehovah Even Sinai before the face of Jehovah Israels God
 6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath In the days of Jael the roads were deserted Travelers kept to the back roads
 7 The villagers in Israel were no more They were no more until I Deborah rose up Until I arose as a mother in Israel
 8 They chose new gods Then there was war in the gates
A shield could not be seen nor a lance Among 40000 in Israel
 9 My heart is with the commanders of Israel Who went as volunteers with the people
Praise Jehovah
10 You riders on tawny donkeys You who sit on fine carpets And you who walk on the road Consider
11 The voices of the water distributors were heard at the watering places There they were recounting the righteous acts of Jehovah The righteous acts of his villagers in Israel
Then Jehovahs people went down to the gates
12 Awake awake O Deborah
Awake awake sing a song
Rise up Barak Lead your captives away you son of Abinoam
13 Then those who were left came down to the nobles Jehovahs people came down to me against the mighty
14 Out of Ephraim was their origin those in the valley They are following you O Benjamin among your peoples
From Machir the commanders went down And from Zebulun those who bear the recruiters staff
15 The princes in Issachar were with Deborah As was Issachar so was Barak
Into the valley plain he was sent on foot
Among the divisions of Reuben there was intense heart-searching
16 Why did you sit down between the two saddlebags Listening to them playing their pipes for the flocks
For the divisions of Reuben there was intense heart-searching
17 Gilead remained beyond the Jordan And Dan why did he stay with the ships
Asher sat idle at the seashore And by his harbors he remained
18 Zebulun was a people who risked their lives to the point of death Naphtali also on the open heights
19 Kings came they fought The kings of Canaan then foughtIn Taanach by the waters of Megiddo
No spoil of silver did they take
20 From heaven the stars fought From their orbits they fought against Sisera
21 The torrent of Kishon washed them away The ancient torrent the torrent of Kishon
You trampled down the powerful O my soul
22 Then the hooves of horses poundedAs his stallions galloped furiously
23 Curse Meroz  said the angel of Jehovah Yes curse its inhabitants For they did not come to the assistance of Jehovah To the assistance of Jehovah with the mighty ones
24 Most blessed of women is JaelThe wife of Heber the Kenite She is most blessed of women living in tents
25 He asked for water she gave him milk
In a majestic banquet bowl she offered curdled milk
26 With her hand she reached for the tent pin Her right hand for the workmans mallet
And she hammered Sisera she crushed his head And she smashed and pierced his temples
27 Between her feet he collapsed he fell and lay still Between her feet he collapsed and fell Where he collapsed there he fell defeated
28 From the window a woman looked out Siseras mother peered out from the lattice Why is his chariot delayed in coming
Why are the hoofbeats of his chariots so late
29 The wisest of her noble ladies would answer her Yes she too would repeat to herself 30 They must be dividing the spoil they found A girl two girls to every warrior Spoil of dyed cloth for Sisera spoil of dyed cloth An embroidered garment dyed cloth two embroidered garmentsFor the necks of the plunderers
31 So let all your enemies perish O Jehovah But let those who love you be like the sun rising in its glory
And the land had rest for 40 years
