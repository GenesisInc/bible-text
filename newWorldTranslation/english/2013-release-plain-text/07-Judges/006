1 But the Israelites again did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah so Jehovah gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years 2 The hand of Midian dominated over Israel Because of Midian the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains in the caves and in the places difficult to approach 3 If Israel sowed seed Midian and Amalek and the Easterners would attack them 4 They would camp against them and ruin the produce of the land all the way to Gaza and they left nothing for Israel to eat and no sheep or bull or donkey 5 For they would come up with their livestock and tents as numerous as the locusts and they and their camels could not be numbered and they would come into the land to destroy it 6 So Israel became greatly impoverished on account of Midian and the Israelites called to Jehovah for help
7 When the Israelites called to Jehovah for help because of Midian 8 Jehovah sent to the Israelites a prophet who said to them This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says I brought you up from Egypt and thus brought you out of the house of slavery 9 So I rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from all your oppressors and drove them out from before you and gave you their land 10 And I said to you I am Jehovah your God You must not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling But you did not obey me
11 Later Jehovahs angel came and sat under the big tree that was in Ophrah which belonged to Joash the Abi-ezrite His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from Midian 12 Jehovahs angel appeared to him and said Jehovah is with you you mighty warrior 13 At this Gideon said to him Pardon me my lord but if Jehovah is with us why has all of this come upon us Where are all his wonderful acts that our fathers related to us saying Did Jehovah not bring us up out of Egypt Now Jehovah has deserted us and given us into Midians hand 14 Jehovah faced him and said Go with the strength you have and you will save Israel out of Midians hand Is it not I who send you 15 Gideon answered him Pardon me Jehovah How can I save Israel Look My clan is the least in Manasseh and I am the most insignificant in my fathers house 16 But Jehovah said to him Because I will be with you you will strike down Midian as if they were one man
17 Then he said to him If now I have found favor in your eyes show me a sign that you are the one speaking with me 18 Please do not depart from here until I return with my gift and set it before you So he said I will stay here until you return 19 And Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and made unleavened bread from an ephah of flour He put the meat in the basket and the broth in the cooking pot then he brought them out to him and served them under the big tree
20 The angel of the true God now said to him Take the meat and the unleavened bread and place them on the big rock there and pour out the broth And he did so 21 Then Jehovahs angel stretched out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread and fire flared up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread Jehovahs angel then vanished from his sight 22 Gideon now realized that it was Jehovahs angel
At once Gideon said Alas Sovereign Lord Jehovah for I have seen Jehovahs angel face-to-face 23 But Jehovah said to him Peace be with you Have no fear you will not die 24 So Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah and it is called Jehovah-shalom down to this day It is still in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites
25 That night Jehovah said to him Take the young bull that belongs to your father the second young bull that is seven years old and tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father and cut down the sacred pole next to it 26 After you build an altar to Jehovah your God on top of this stronghold with the row of stones take the second young bull and offer it as a burnt offering on the pieces of wood from the sacred pole that you cut down 27 So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did just as Jehovah told him But he feared the household of his father and the men of the city too much to do it by day so he did it at night
28 When the men of the city got up early the next morning they saw that the altar of Baal had been pulled down and the sacred pole beside it had been cut down and the second young bull had been offered up on the altar that had been built 29 They asked one another Who did this After they investigated they said Gideon the son of Joash did this 30 So the men of the city said to Joash Bring your son out that he may die because he pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the sacred pole next to it 31 Joash then said to all those who confronted him Do you have to defend Baal Do you have to save him Whoever defends him should be put to death this morning If he is a god let him defend himself since someone pulled down his altar 32 And he called Gideon Jerubbaal on that day saying Let Baal defend himself for someone has pulled down his altar
33 All Midian and Amalek and the Easterners joined forces and they crossed over into the Valley of Jezreel and camped 34 Then Jehovahs spirit came upon Gideon and he sounded the horn and the Abi-ezrites rallied behind him 35 He sent out messengers through all of Manasseh and they too rallied behind him He also sent out messengers through Asher Zebulun and Naphtali and they came up to meet him
36 Then Gideon said to the true God If you are saving Israel by means of me just as you have promised 37 here I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor If there is dew on the fleece only but all the ground around it is dry then I will know that you will save Israel by means of me just as you have promised 38 And that is how it happened When he rose up early the next day and wrung the fleece he squeezed off enough dew from the fleece to fill a large banquet bowl with water 39 However Gideon said to the true God Do not let your anger burn against me but let me ask just once more Let me please make just one more test with the fleece Please let the fleece alone be dry while there is dew all over the ground 40 So that is what God did that night only the fleece was dry and there was dew all over the ground
