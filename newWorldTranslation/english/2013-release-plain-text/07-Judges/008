1 Then the men of Ephraim said to him What have you done to us Why did you not call us when you went to fight against Midian And they quarreled bitterly with him 2 But he said to them What have I done compared with you Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abi-ezer 3 It was into your hand that God gave Midians princes Oreb and Zeeb and what have I done compared with you When he spoke this way they calmed down
4 Gideon then came to the Jordan and crossed it He and the 300 men with him were tired but they kept up the pursuit 5 So he said to the men of Succoth Please give loaves of bread to the people following me for they are tired and I am chasing after Zebah and Zalmunna the kings of Midian 6 But the princes of Succoth said Are the palms of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand so that we should give bread to your army 7 At this Gideon said Just for that when Jehovah gives Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand I will give you a thrashing with the thorns and the briars of the wilderness 8 And he went up from there to Penuel and made the same request but the men of Penuel gave him the same answer as the men of Succoth 9 So he said also to the men of Penuel When I return in peace I will pull down this tower
10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their armies about 15000 men These were all who remained of the entire army of the Easterners for 120000 men armed with swords had fallen 11 Gideon continued up by the way of the tent dwellers east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the camp which was off guard 12 When Zebah and Zalmunna fled he pursued and captured the two Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna throwing the whole camp into a panic
13 Gideon the son of Joash then returned from the war by way of the pass that goes up to Heres 14 En route he captured and interrogated a young man from Succoth So the young man wrote out for him the names of the princes and elders of Succoth 77 men 15 With that he went to the men of Succoth and said Here are Zebah and Zalmunna about whom you taunted me saying Are the palms of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand so that we should give bread to your exhausted men 16 Then he took the elders of the city and with thorns and briars of the wilderness he taught the men of Succoth a lesson 17 And he pulled down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city
18 He asked Zebah and Zalmunna What sort of men did you kill in Tabor To this they said They were like you each one looked like the son of a king 19 At that he said They were my brothers the sons of my mother As surely as Jehovah lives if you had spared their lives I would not have to kill you 20 Then he said to Jether his firstborn Get up kill them But the young man did not draw his sword he was afraid for he was still a young man 21 So Zebah and Zalmunna said Get up yourself and slay us for a man is judged by his mightiness So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna and took the crescent-shaped ornaments that were on the necks of their camels
22 Later the men of Israel said to Gideon Rule over us you and your son and your grandson as well for you saved us out of the hand of Midian 23 But Gideon said to them I will not rule over you nor will my son rule over you Jehovah is the one who will rule over you 24 Gideon continued Let me make one request of you that each of you give me a nose ring from his spoil For they had gold nose rings because they were Ishmaelites 25 They replied We will surely give them With that they spread out a robe and each man threw a nose ring from his spoil on it 26 The weight of the gold nose rings that he had requested amounted to 1700 gold shekels besides the crescent-shaped ornaments the pendants the purple wool garments worn by the kings of Midian and the necklaces from the camels
27 Gideon made it into an ephod and exhibited it in his city Ophrah and all Israel committed spiritual prostitution with it there and it served as a snare to Gideon and to his household
28 Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and they did not challenge them again and the land had rest for 40 years in the days of Gideon
29 So Jerubbaal the son of Joash returned to his home and stayed there
30 Gideon became father to 70 sons for he had many wives 31 His concubine in Shechem also bore him a son and he named him Abimelech 32 And Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites
33 As soon as Gideon died the Israelites again committed spiritual prostitution with the Baals and they appointed Baal-berith as their god 34 The Israelites did not remember Jehovah their God who had rescued them from the hand of all their enemies around them 35 nor did they show loyal love toward the household of Jerubbaal that is Gideon in return for all the good that he had done for Israel
