1 In those days there was no king in Israel And in those days the tribe of the Danites was looking for an inheritance to dwell in because until then they had not received an inheritance among the tribes of Israel
2 The Danites sent five men from among their family capable men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and to explore it They said to them Go explore the land When they came to the mountainous region of Ephraim to the house of Micah they spent the night there 3 While they were near the house of Micah they recognized the voice of the young Levite man so they went over to him and asked Who brought you here What are you doing in this place What is keeping you here 4 He replied to them Thus and so Micah did for me and he hired me to serve as priest for him 5 Then they said to him Please ask God whether our journey will be successful 6 The priest said to them Go in peace Jehovah is with you on your journey
7 So the five men went on and came to Laish They saw how the people in it were dwelling in self-reliance in the manner of the Sidonians They were quiet and unsuspecting and no oppressive conqueror was in the land to disturb them They were far away from the Sidonians and they had no dealings with anyone else
8 When they returned to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol their brothers said to them How did it go 9 They replied Let us go up against them for we have seen that the land is very good Why are you hesitant Do not delay to go in to take possession of the land 10 When you arrive you will find an unsuspecting people and the land is spacious God has given it into your hand a place where there is no lack of anything on the earth
11 Then 600 men armed for battle from the family of the Danites departed from Zorah and Eshtaol 12 They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah That is why that place which is west of Kiriath-jearim is called Mahaneh-dan to this day 13 They went from there to the mountainous region of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah
14 Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish said to their brothers Did you know that there are in these houses an ephod teraphim statues a carved image and a metal statue Think about what you should do 15 So they stopped there and came to the house of the young Levite man at the house of Micah and asked how he was 16 All the while the 600 men of Dan armed for battle stood at the entrance of the gate 17 The five men who had gone to spy out the land went inside to take the carved image the ephod the teraphim statues and the metal image The priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed for battle 18 They went into the house of Micah and took the carved image the ephod the teraphim statues and the metal image The priest said to them What are you doing 19 But they said to him Be quiet Put your hand over your mouth and come with us to be a father and a priest for us Which is betterâ€”for you to be a priest to the house of one man or to become a priest to a tribe and family in Israel 20 So the priest was satisfied and he took the ephod the teraphim statues and the carved image and went off with the people
21 Then they turned to go on their way putting the children the livestock and the valuable things ahead of them 22 They had gone some distance away from the house of Micah when the men who lived in the houses near the house of Micah gathered together and caught up with the Danites 23 When they cried out to the Danites they turned to face them and said to Micah What is the matter Why have you been gathered together 24 So he said You have taken my gods that I made and you have gone off with the priest too What do I have left How then can you ask me What is the matter with you 25 The Danites replied Do not raise your voice against us otherwise angry men may assault you and that would cost you your life and the lives of your household 26 So the Danites went on their way and Micah seeing that they were stronger than he was turned and went back to his house
27 After they took what Micah had made as well as his priest they went to Laish to a people quiet and unsuspecting They struck them down with the sword and burned the city with fire 28 There was no one to rescue it for it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone else and it was in the valley plain that belonged to Beth-rehob Then they rebuilt the city and settled in it 29 Furthermore they named the city Dan after the name of their father Dan who was born to Israel But Laish was the citys former name 30 After that the Danites set up the carved image for themselves and Jonathan the son of Gershom the son of Moses and his sons became priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day that the inhabitants of the land went into exile 31 And they set up the carved image that Micah had made and it remained there all the days that the house of the true God was in Shiloh
