1 After Abimelech Tola the son of Puah the son of Dodo a man of Issachar rose up to save Israel He lived in Shamir in the mountainous region of Ephraim 2 He judged Israel for 23 years Then he died and was buried in Shamir
3 After him Jair the Gileadite rose up and judged Israel for 22 years 4 He had 30 sons who rode on 30 donkeys and they had 30 cities which to this day are called Havvoth-jair they are in the land of Gilead 5 After that Jair died and was buried in Kamon
6 Again the Israelites did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and they began to serve the Baals the Ashtoreth images the gods of Aram the gods of Sidon the gods of Moab the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines They abandoned Jehovah and did not serve him 7 Then Jehovahs anger blazed against Israel and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites 8 So they crushed and greatly oppressed the Israelites in that yearâ€”for 18 years they oppressed all the Israelites on the side of the Jordan that had been the land of the Amorites in Gilead 9 The Ammonites would also cross the Jordan to fight against Judah and Benjamin and the house of Ephraim and Israel was greatly distressed 10 Then the Israelites called to Jehovah for help saying We have sinned against you for we abandoned our God and served the Baals
11 But Jehovah said to the Israelites Did I not save you from Egypt and from the Amorites the Ammonites the Philistines 12 the Sidonians Amalek and Midian when they oppressed you When you cried out to me I saved you out of their hand 13 But you abandoned me and served other gods That is why I will not save you again 14 Go to the gods whom you have chosen and call for help Let them save you in your time of distress 15 But the Israelites said to Jehovah We have sinned Do to us whatever is good in your eyes Only save us please this day 16 And they removed the foreign gods from their midst and served Jehovah so that he could no longer tolerate Israels suffering
17 In time the Ammonites were called together and they pitched camp in Gilead So the Israelites gathered together and pitched camp in Mizpah 18 The people and the princes of Gilead said to one another Who will take the lead in fighting against the Ammonites Let him become the chief over all the inhabitants of Gilead
