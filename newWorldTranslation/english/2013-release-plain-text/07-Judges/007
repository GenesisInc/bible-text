1 Then Jerubbaal that is Gideon and all the people with him rose early and encamped at the Spring of Harod while the camp of Midian was north of him at the hill of Moreh in the valley plain 2 Jehovah now said to Gideon There are too many people with you for me to give Midian into their hand Otherwise Israel might brag about itself against me and say My own hand saved me 3 Now please announce in the presence of the people Whoever is afraid and trembling let him return home So Gideon put them to the test With that 22000 of the people returned home and 10000 remained
4 Still Jehovah said to Gideon There are yet too many people Have them go down to the water so that I may test them for you there When I say to you This one will go with you  he will go with you but when I say to you This one will not go along with you  he will not go along 5 So he took the people down to the water
Then Jehovah said to Gideon Separate everyone who laps up the water with his tongue just as a dog laps from those who bend down on their knees to drink 6 The number of those lapping up the water putting their hand to their mouth was 300 men The rest of the people bent down on their knees to drink
7 Jehovah now said to Gideon I will save you with the 300 men who lapped the water and I will give Midian into your hand But let all the other people go back home 8 So after they took the provisions and the horns from the people he sent all the other men of Israel back home and he kept only the 300 men The camp of Midian was below him in the valley plain
9 During that night Jehovah said to him Get up attack the camp for I have given it into your hand 10 But if you are afraid to attack go down to the camp with Purah your attendant 11 Listen to what they say and afterward you will have the courage to attack the camp At that he and Purah his attendant went down to the edge of the encamped army
12 Now Midian and Amalek and all the Easterners covered the valley plain like a swarm of locusts and their camels were without number as many as the grains of sand on the seashore 13 Gideon now came and there was a man relating a dream to his companion and he said This is the dream I had There was a round loaf of barley bread rolling into the camp of Midian It came to a tent and struck it so hard that it collapsed Yes it turned the tent upside down and the tent fell flat 14 At this his companion said This can only be the sword of Gideon the son of Joash a man of Israel God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand
15 As soon as Gideon heard him relate the dream and its interpretation he bowed down to worship After that he returned to the camp of Israel and said Get up for Jehovah has given the camp of Midian into your hand 16 Then he divided the 300 men into three bands and gave all of them horns and large empty jars with torches inside the jars 17 Then he said to them Watch me and do exactly what I do When I come to the edge of the camp you should do just as I do 18 When I blow the horn I and all who are with me you also must blow the horns all around the camp and shout For Jehovah and for Gideon
19 Gideon and the 100 men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the start of the middle night watch just after the sentries were posted They blew the horns and smashed the large water jars that were in their hands 20 So the three bands blew the horns and shattered the large jars They held the torches in their left hands and blew the horns in their right hands and they called out The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon 21 All the while each man stood in his place all around the camp and the whole army ran away shouting as they fled 22 The 300 continued to blow the horns and Jehovah turned the sword of each one against the other throughout the camp and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah on to Zererah as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah by Tabbath
23 And the men of Israel were called together from Naphtali Asher and all of Manasseh and they chased after Midian 24 Gideon sent messengers into all the mountainous region of Ephraim saying Go down to attack Midian and capture the access to the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan 25 They also captured the two princes of Midian Oreb and Zeeb they killed Oreb on the rock of Oreb and they killed Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb They kept on pursuing Midian and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon in the region of the Jordan
