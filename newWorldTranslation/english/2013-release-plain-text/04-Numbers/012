1 Now Miriam and Aaron began to speak against Moses because of the Cushite wife he had married for he had taken a Cushite wife 2 They were saying Is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken Has he not also spoken through us And Jehovah was listening 3 Now the man Moses was by far the meekest of all the men on the face of the earth
4 Jehovah suddenly said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam Go out the three of you to the tent of meeting So the three of them went out 5 And Jehovah came down in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam Both of them went forward 6 He then said Hear my words please If there was a prophet of Jehovah among you I would make myself known to him in a vision and I would speak to him in a dream 7 But it is not that way with my servant Moses He is being entrusted with all my house 8 Face-to-face I speak to him openly not by riddles and the appearance of Jehovah is what he sees Why then did you not fear to speak against my servant against Moses
9 So Jehovahs anger burned against them and he departed from them 10 The cloud moved away from over the tent and look Miriam was struck with leprosy as white as snow Then Aaron turned toward Miriam and he saw that she was struck with leprosy 11 Immediately Aaron said to Moses I beg you my lord Please do not hold this sin against us We have acted foolishly in what we have done 12 Please do not let her continue like someone dead whose flesh is half eaten away at birth 13 And Moses began to cry out to Jehovah saying O God please heal her Please
14 Jehovah replied to Moses If her father would spit directly in her face would she not be humiliated for seven days Let her be quarantined for seven days outside the camp and afterward she may be brought back in 15 So Miriam was quarantined outside the camp for seven days and the people did not break camp until Miriam was brought back in 16 Then the people departed from Hazeroth and began camping in the wilderness of Paran
