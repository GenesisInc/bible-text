1 Jehovah now spoke to Moses saying 2 Send out men to spy out the land of Canaan which I am giving to the Israelites You are to send out one man from each ancestral tribe each one a chieftain among them
3 So Moses sent them out from the wilderness of Paran at the order of Jehovah All the men were heads of the Israelites 4 These are their names of the tribe of Reuben Shammua the son of Zaccur 5 of the tribe of Simeon Shaphat the son of Hori 6 of the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of Jephunneh 7 of the tribe of Issachar Igal the son of Joseph 8 of the tribe of Ephraim Hoshea the son of Nun 9 of the tribe of Benjamin Palti the son of Raphu 10 of the tribe of Zebulun Gaddiel the son of Sodi 11 of the tribe of Joseph for the tribe of Manasseh Gaddi the son of Susi 12 of the tribe of Dan Ammiel the son of Gemalli 13 of the tribe of Asher Sethur the son of Michael 14 of the tribe of Naphtali Nahbi the son of Vophsi 15 of the tribe of Gad Geuel the son of Machi 16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land And Moses gave the name Joshua to Hoshea the son of Nun
17 When Moses was sending them to spy out the land of Canaan he said to them Go up there into the Negeb and then go up into the mountainous region 18 You must see what kind of land it is and whether the people who are dwelling in it are strong or weak few or many 19 and whether the land is good or bad and whether the cities they are dwelling in are encampments or fortifications 20 And find out whether the land is rich or poor and whether there are trees in it or not You must be courageous and take some of the fruitage of the land Now it was the season of the first ripe grapes
21 So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob to Lebo-hamath 22 When they went up into the Negeb they came to Hebron where Ahiman Sheshai and Talmai the Anakim were living Incidentally Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan of Egypt 23 When they came to the Valley of Eshcol there they cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes which two of the men had to carry on a bar as well as some of the pomegranates and figs 24 They called that place the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster that the Israelites cut down from there
25 At the end of 40 days they returned from spying out the land 26 So they came back to Moses and Aaron and all the assembly of the Israelites in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh They brought back a report to all the assembly and showed them the fruitage of the land 27 This is what they reported to Moses We entered the land into which you sent us and it is indeed flowing with milk and honey and this is its fruitage 28 Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong and the fortified cities are very great We also saw the Anakim there 29 The Amalekites are dwelling in the land of the Negeb and the Hittites the Jebusites and the Amorites are dwelling in the mountainous region and the Canaanites are dwelling by the sea and along the Jordan
30 Then Caleb tried to calm the people as they stood before Moses by saying Let us go up immediately and we are sure to take possession of it because we can surely conquer it 31 But the men who went up with him said We are not able to go up against the people because they are stronger than we are 32 And they kept on giving the Israelites a bad report about the land that they had spied out saying The land that we passed through to spy out is a land that devours its inhabitants and all the people whom we saw in it are men of extraordinary size 33 And there we saw the Nephilim the sons of Anak who are from the Nephilim and in comparison we seemed like grasshoppers both to us and to them
