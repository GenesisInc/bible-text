1 Then Balaam said to Balak Build on this spot seven altars and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me 2 Balak immediately did just as Balaam had said And Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar 3 Balaam then said to Balak Stay here by your burnt offering and I will go Perhaps Jehovah will get in touch with me Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you So he went to a barren hill
4 Then God got in touch with Balaam who said to Him I set the seven altars in rows and I offered up a bull and a ram on each altar 5 Jehovah put this word in the mouth of Balaam Return to Balak and this is what you are to say 6 So he returned and saw that Balak and all the princes of Moab were standing by his burnt offering 7 Then he spoke this proverbial saying
Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram From the mountains of the east
Do come to curse Jacob for me
Yes come to denounce Israel
 8 How could I put a curse on those whom God has not cursed
And how could I denounce those whom Jehovah has not denounced
 9 From the top of the rocks I see them And from the hills I see them
As a people they dwell there alone They do not count themselves among the nations
10 Who can number the dust particles of JacobOr count even the fourth part of Israel
Let me die the death of the upright And let my end be like theirs
11 Balak then said to Balaam What have you done to me I brought you to put a curse on my enemies and here you have done nothing but bless them 12 He answered Must I not speak whatever Jehovah puts in my mouth
13 Balak said to him Please come with me to another place from which you can see them You will see only a part of them you will not see them all Put a curse on them for me from there 14 So he took him to the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar 15 So Balaam said to Balak Stay here by your burnt offering while I get in touch with Him over there 16 And Jehovah got in touch with Balaam and put this word in his mouth Return to Balak and this is what you are to say 17 So he came to him and saw that he was waiting by his burnt offering and the princes of Moab were with him Balak asked him What has Jehovah said 18 Then he spoke this proverbial saying
Get up Balak and listen
Hear me O son of Zippor
19 God is not a mere man who tells lies Nor a son of man who changes his mind
When he says something will he not do it
When he speaks will he not carry it out
20 Look I have been taken to bless Now He has blessed and I cannot reverse it
21 He does not tolerate any magical power against Jacob And he does not allow any trouble against Israel
Jehovah his God is with them And he is loudly hailed as king among them
22 God is bringing them out of Egypt
He is like the horns of a wild bull for them
23 For there are no omens of doom against Jacob Nor any divination against Israel
At this time it may be said about Jacob and Israel
Look at what God has done
24 Here is a people who will rise up like a lion And like the lion it will raise itself up
It will not lie down until it eats preyAnd drinks the blood of the slain ones
25 Balak then said to Balaam If on the one hand you cannot put any curse on him then on the other hand you should not bless him either 26 Balaam answered Balak Did I not say to you I will do all that Jehovah says
27 Balak said to Balaam Please come and let me take you to yet another place Perhaps it will be right in the eyes of the true God for you to put a curse on him for me from there 28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which looks toward Jeshimon 29 Then Balaam said to Balak Build seven altars on this spot and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me 30 So Balak did just as Balaam had said and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar
