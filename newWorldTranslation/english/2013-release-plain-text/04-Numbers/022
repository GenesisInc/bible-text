1 Then the Israelites departed and camped on the desert plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho 2 Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites 3 and Moab became very frightened of the people because they were so many indeed Moab felt sick with fear because of the Israelites 4 So Moab said to the elders of Midian Now this congregation will devour all our surroundings just as a bull devours the grass in the field
Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time 5 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor which is by the River in his native land He summoned him saying Look A people has come out of Egypt Look They have covered the face of the earth and they are dwelling right in front of me 6 Now please come and curse this people for me for they are mightier than I am Perhaps I can defeat them and drive them out of the land for I well know that the one whom you bless is blessed and the one whom you curse is cursed
7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian traveled with the fee for divination in their hands and went to Balaam and conveyed to him Balaks message 8 At that he said to them Spend the night here and I will bring back to you whatever word Jehovah speaks to me So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam
9 Then God came to Balaam and said Who are these men with you 10 Balaam said to the true God Balak the son of Zippor the king of Moab has sent me a message saying 11 Look The people who are coming out of Egypt are covering the face of the earth Now come and put a curse on them for me Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out 12 But God said to Balaam You must not go with them You must not curse the people for they are blessed
13 Balaam got up in the morning and said to the princes of Balak Go to your land for Jehovah has refused to let me go with you 14 So the princes of Moab departed and returned to Balak and said Balaam has refused to come with us
15 However Balak again sent princes more numerous and more distinguished than the first group 16 They came to Balaam and said to him This is what Balak the son of Zippor has said Please do not let anything hinder you from coming to me 17 for I will honor you greatly and I will do anything you tell me to do So come please and curse this people for me 18 But Balaam answered the servants of Balak If Balak were to give me his own house full of silver and gold I could not do anything beyond the order of Jehovah my God whether small or great 19 But please stay here tonight also so that I may learn what else Jehovah will tell me
20 Then God came to Balaam by night and said to him If these men have come to summon you go along with them But you may speak only the words that I tell you to say 21 So Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab
22 But Gods anger blazed because he was going and Jehovahs angel stationed himself in the road to resist him Now Balaam was riding on his donkey and two of his attendants were with him 23 And when the donkey saw Jehovahs angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand it tried to turn off the road into the field But Balaam began to beat the donkey to make it return to the road 24 Then Jehovahs angel stood in a narrow path between two vineyards with stone walls on both sides 25 When the donkey saw Jehovahs angel it began to squeeze itself against the wall and it jammed Balaams foot against the wall and Balaam began beating it again
26 Jehovahs angel now passed by again and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or to the left 27 When the donkey saw Jehovahs angel it lay down under Balaam so Balaam became furious and kept beating the donkey with his staff 28 Finally Jehovah caused the donkey to speak and it said to Balaam What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times 29 Balaam replied to the donkey It is because you have made a fool of me If only I had a sword in my hand I would kill you 30 Then the donkey said to Balaam Am I not your donkey that you have ridden on all your life until today Have I ever treated you this way before He replied No 31 Then Jehovah uncovered Balaams eyes and he saw Jehovahs angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand At once he bowed low and prostrated himself on his face
32 Then Jehovahs angel said to him Why have you beaten your donkey these three times Look I myself came out to offer resistance because your way is in defiance of my will 33 The donkey saw me and tried to turn away from me these three times Supposing it had not turned away from me By now I would have killed you and let the donkey live 34 Balaam said to Jehovahs angel I have sinned because I did not know that it was you standing in the road to meet me And now if it is bad in your eyes I will go back 35 But Jehovahs angel said to Balaam Go with the men but you may speak only the words that I tell you So Balaam continued going with the princes of Balak
36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come he immediately went out to meet him at the city of Moab which is on the bank of the Arnon on the border of the territory 37 Balak said to Balaam Did I not send for you Why did you not come to me Did you think I am not able to honor you greatly 38 Balaam replied to Balak Well I have come to you now But will I be allowed to say anything I can only speak words that God puts in my mouth
39 So Balaam went with Balak and they came to Kiriath-huzoth 40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent some to Balaam and the princes who were with him 41 In the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal from there he could see all the people
