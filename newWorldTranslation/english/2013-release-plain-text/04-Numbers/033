1 These were the stages of the journey of the people of Israel when they went out of the land of Egypt by their companies under the direction of Moses and Aaron 2 Moses kept recording the departure places by the stages of their journey at the order of Jehovah and these were their stages from one departure place to another 3 They departed from Rameses in the first month on the 15th day of the month On the very day after the Passover the Israelites went out with confidence before the eyes of all the Egyptians 4 Meanwhile the Egyptians were burying all the firstborn whom Jehovah had struck down among them for Jehovah had executed judgments on their gods
5 So the Israelites departed from Rameses and camped at Succoth 6 Then they departed from Succoth and camped at Etham which is on the edge of the wilderness 7 Next they departed from Etham and turned back toward Pihahiroth which is in view of Baal-zephon and they camped before Migdol 8 After that they departed from Pihahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea to the wilderness and kept marching a three-day journey in the wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah
9 Then they departed from Marah and came to Elim Now in Elim there were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees so they camped there 10 Next they departed from Elim and camped by the Red Sea 11 After that they departed from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin 12 Then they departed from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah 13 Later they departed from Dophkah and camped at Alush 14 They next departed from Alush and camped at Rephidim where there was no water for the people to drink 15 After that they departed from Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai
16 They departed from the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah 17 Then they departed from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth 18 After that they departed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah 19 Next they departed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez 20 Then they departed from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah 21 They departed from Libnah and camped at Rissah 22 Next they departed from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah 23 Then they departed from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher

37 Later they departed from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor on the frontier of the land of Edom 38 And Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the order of Jehovah and died there in the 40th year after the Israelites left the land of Egypt in the fifth month on the first of the month 39 Aaron was 123 years old at his death on Mount Hor
40 Now the king of Arad the Canaanite who was dwelling in the Negeb in the land of Canaan heard about the coming of the Israelites
41 In time they departed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah 42 After that they departed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon 43 Next they departed from Punon and camped at Oboth 44 Then they departed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim on the border of Moab 45 Later they departed from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad 46 After that they departed from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim 47 Then they departed from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim before Nebo 48 Finally they departed from the mountains of Abarim and camped on the desert plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho 49 They continued camping along the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim on the desert plains of Moab
50 Jehovah spoke to Moses on the desert plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho saying 51 Speak to the Israelites and tell them You are crossing the Jordan into the land of Canaan 52 You must drive away all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their carvings of stone and all their metal statues and you should demolish all their sacred high places 53 And you will take possession of the land and dwell in it because I will certainly give you the land as a possession 54 You must apportion the land by lot as a possession among your families To the larger group you should increase his inheritance and to the smaller group you should reduce his inheritance Everyones inheritance will be where his lot falls You will receive your property as an inheritance by the tribes of your fathers
55 If though you do not drive the inhabitants of the land away from before you those whom you allow to remain will be as irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides and they will harass you in the land where you will dwell 56 And I will do to you what I intended to do to them
