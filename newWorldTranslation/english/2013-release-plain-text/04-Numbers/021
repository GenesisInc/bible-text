1 When the Canaanite king of Arad who dwelled in the Negeb heard that Israel had come by the way of Atharim he attacked Israel and carried away some of them as captives 2 So Israel made this vow to Jehovah If you give this people into my hand I will without fail devote their cities to destruction 3 So Jehovah listened to Israels voice and gave the Canaanites over to them and they devoted them and their cities to destruction Therefore they named the place Hormah
4 As they continued their journey from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea in order to go around the land of Edom the people became weary of the journey 5 And the people kept speaking against God and Moses saying Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness There is no food and no water and we have come to hate this contemptible bread 6 So Jehovah sent poisonous serpents among the people and they kept biting the people so that many Israelites died
7 So the people came to Moses and said We have sinned by speaking against Jehovah and against you Intercede with Jehovah so that he may remove the serpents from us And Moses interceded on behalf of the people 8 Then Jehovah said to Moses Make a replica of a poisonous snake and put it on a pole Then when anyone has been bitten he will have to look at it in order to keep alive 9 Moses at once made a serpent of copper and put it on the pole and whenever a serpent had bitten a man and he looked at the copper serpent he survived
10 After that the Israelites departed and camped in Oboth 11 Then they departed from Oboth and camped in Iye-abarim in the wilderness that faces Moab toward the east 12 From there they departed and camped by the Valley of Zered 13 From there they departed and camped in the region of the Arnon which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab between Moab and the Amorites 14 That is why the book of the Wars of Jehovah speaks of Vaheb in Suphah and the valleys of Arnon 15 and the descent of the valleys which extends toward the settlement of Ar and adjoins the border of Moab
16 Next they went on to Beer This is the well about which Jehovah said to Moses Gather the people and let me give them water
17 At that time Israel sang this song
Spring up O wellâ€”Respond to it
18 The well that princes dug that nobles of the people excavated With a commanders staff and with their own staffs
Then they went from the wilderness on to Mattanah 19 from Mattanah on to Nahaliel and from Nahaliel on to Bamoth 20 They went from Bamoth on to the valley that is in the territory of Moab on top of Pisgah which overlooks Jeshimon
21 Israel now sent messengers to Sihon the king of the Amorites saying 22 Let us pass through your land We will not turn aside into a field or a vineyard We will not drink water from any well We will march on the Kings Road until we pass through your territory 23 But Sihon did not allow Israel to pass through his territory Instead Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness and came to Jahaz and began fighting with Israel 24 But Israel defeated him with the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok near the Ammonites because Jazer borders the territory of the Ammonites
25 So Israel took all these cities and they began dwelling in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and all its dependent towns 26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites who had fought with the king of Moab and taken all his land from him as far as the Arnon 27 That is what gave rise to the taunting proverbial saying
Come to Heshbon
Let the city of Sihon be built and firmly established
28 For a fire came out of Heshbon a flame from the town of Sihon
It has consumed Ar of Moab the lords of the high places of the Arnon
29 Woe to you Moab You will be destroyed O people of Chemosh
He makes his sons fugitives and his daughters captives of Sihon the king of the Amorites
30 Let us shoot at them Heshbon will be destroyed as far as Dibon Let us desolate it as far as Nophah Fire will spread as far as Medeba
31 So Israel began to dwell in the land of the Amorites 32 Moses then sent some men to spy on Jazer They captured its dependent towns and drove out the Amorites who were there 33 After that they turned and went up by way of Bashan And Og the king of Bashan came out with all his people to meet them in battle at Edrei 34 Jehovah said to Moses Do not be afraid of him for I will give him and all his people and his land into your hand and you will do to him just as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon 35 So they kept striking him down along with his sons and all his people until none of his people survived and they took possession of his land
