1 When Israel was dwelling in Shittim the people started to commit sexual immorality with the daughters of Moab 2 The women invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods and the people began to eat and to bow down to their gods 3 So Israel joined in worship of the Baal of Peor and Jehovah became enraged with Israel 4 Jehovah said to Moses Take all the leaders of these people and hang them up before Jehovah in broad daylight that the burning anger of Jehovah may turn back from Israel 5 Then Moses said to the judges of Israel Each one of you should kill his men who joined in worship of the Baal of Peor
6 But just then there came one of the Israelites bringing near to his brothers a Midianite woman before the eyes of Moses and of all the assembly of the Israelites while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting 7 When Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it he immediately rose up from the midst of the assembly and took a spear in his hand 8 Then he went after the man of Israel into the tent and pierced both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her genital parts At that the scourge on the Israelites was halted 9 Those who died from the scourge amounted to 24000
10 Then Jehovah said to Moses 11 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest has turned my wrath away from the people of Israel because he tolerated no rivalry at all toward me among them So I have not exterminated the Israelites in my insistence on exclusive devotion 12 Therefore say I am giving him my covenant of peace 13 And it will serve as the covenant of a lasting priesthood for him and his offspring after him because he tolerated no rivalry toward his God and he made atonement for the people of Israel
14 Incidentally the name of the Israelite man who was put to death along with the Midianitess was Zimri the son of Salu a chieftain of a paternal house of the Simeonites 15 The name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Cozbi the daughter of Zur he was a leader of the clans of a paternal house in Midian
16 Jehovah later said to Moses 17 Harass the Midianites and strike them down 18 because they have been harassing you with their cunning dealings against you in the affair of Peor and of Cozbi the daughter of a chieftain of Midian their sister who was put to death in the day of the scourge over the affair of Peor
