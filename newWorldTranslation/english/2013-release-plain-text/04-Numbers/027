1 Then the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher the son of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph approached The names of his daughters were Mahlah Noah Hoglah Milcah and Tirzah 2 They stood before Moses Eleazar the priest the chieftains and all the assembly at the entrance of the tent of meeting and said 3 Our father died in the wilderness but he was not among the group who banded together against Jehovah the supporters of Korah but he died for his own sin and he did not have any sons 4 Why should the name of our father be lost from his family because he had no son Give us a possession among our fathers brothers 5 So Moses presented their case before Jehovah
6 Jehovah then said this to Moses 7 The daughters of Zelophehad are correct You should by all means give them the possession as an inheritance among their fathers brothers and transfer their fathers inheritance to them 8 And tell the Israelites If a man dies without having a son you must then cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter 9 And if he has no daughter you will give his inheritance to his brothers 10 And if he has no brothers you will give his inheritance to his fathers brothers 11 And if his father has no brothers you will give his inheritance to the closest blood relative in his family and he will take possession of it This will serve as a statute by judicial decision for the Israelites just as Jehovah has commanded Moses
12 Then Jehovah said to Moses Go up into this mountain of Abarim and view the land that I will give the Israelites 13 When you have seen it you will also be gathered to your people just as Aaron your brother was 14 because when the assembly was quarreling with me in the wilderness of Zin you rebelled against my order to sanctify me before them by means of the waters These are the waters of Meribah at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin
15 Then Moses said to Jehovah 16 Let Jehovah the God of the spirit of all people appoint over the assembly a man 17 who will go out and come in before them and who will lead them out and bring them in so that Jehovahs assembly may not become like sheep that have no shepherd 18 So Jehovah said to Moses Take Joshua the son of Nun a man in whom there is spirit and lay your hand on him 19 Then stand him before Eleazar the priest and before all the assembly and you must commission him before their eyes 20 You are to confer some of your authority on him so that all the assembly of the Israelites may listen to him 21 He will stand before Eleazar the priest who will inquire in his behalf by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah At his order they will go out and at his order they will come in he and all the Israelites with him and all the assembly
22 So Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded him He took Joshua and stood him before Eleazar the priest and before all the assembly 23 and he laid his hands on him and commissioned him just as Jehovah had spoken through Moses
