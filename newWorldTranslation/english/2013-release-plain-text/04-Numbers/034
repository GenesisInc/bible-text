1 And Jehovah spoke further to Moses saying 2 Give these instructions to the Israelites When you go into the land of Canaan this is the land that will fall to you as an inheritance the land of Canaan according to its boundaries
3 Your southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin alongside Edom and your south boundary on the east will be from the extremity of the Salt Sea 4 Your boundary will change direction to pass south of the ascent of Akrabbim and continue to Zin and its end will be south of Kadesh-barnea Then it will extend to Hazar-addar and continue to Azmon 5 The boundary will change direction at Azmon to the Wadi of Egypt and its end will be at the Sea
6 Your western boundary will be the Great Sea and the coast This will become your western boundary
7 Now this will be your northern boundary From the Great Sea you will mark your boundary out to Mount Hor 8 From Mount Hor you will mark out the boundary to Lebo-hamath and the end of the boundary will be at Zedad 9 And the boundary will extend to Ziphron and its end will be Hazar-enan This will become your northern boundary
10 Then you should mark as your boundary on the east from Hazar-enan to Shepham 11 The boundary will extend from Shepham to Riblah to the east of Ain and the border will go down and cross the eastern slope of the Sea of Chinnereth 12 The border will extend to the Jordan and its end will be the Salt Sea This will be your land and the boundaries surrounding it
13 So Moses instructed the Israelites saying This is the land that you will apportion as your possession by lot just as Jehovah has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes 14 For the tribe of the Reubenites by their paternal house the tribe of the Gadites by their paternal house and the half tribe of Manasseh have already taken their inheritance 15 The two and a half tribes have already taken their inheritance east of the region of the Jordan by Jericho toward the sunrising
16 Jehovah spoke further to Moses saying 17 These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you to possess Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun 18 And you will take one chieftain out of each tribe to divide the land as your inheritance 19 These are the names of the men of the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of Jephunneh 20 of the tribe of the sons of Simeon Shemuel the son of Ammihud 21 of the tribe of Benjamin Elidad the son of Chislon 22 of the tribe of the sons of Dan a chieftain Bukki the son of Jogli 23 of the sons of Joseph from the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a chieftain Hanniel the son of Ephod 24 from the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a chieftain Kemuel the son of Shiphtan 25 of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a chieftain Elizaphan the son of Parnach 26 of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a chieftain Paltiel the son of Azzan 27 of the tribe of the sons of Asher a chieftain Ahihud the son of Shelomi 28 of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a chieftain Pedahel the son of Ammihud 29 These are the ones whom Jehovah commanded to distribute the land to the Israelites in the land of Canaan
