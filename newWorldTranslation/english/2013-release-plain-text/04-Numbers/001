1 And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting on the first day of the second month in the second year of their coming out of the land of Egypt He said 2 Take a census of the whole assembly of the Israelites individually according to their families according to their paternal houses according to the count of the names of all the males 3 You and Aaron are to register by their companies all those from 20 years old and up who can serve in the army in Israel
4 Take with you one man from each tribe each one is to be a head of his paternal house 5 These are the names of the men who will stand with you of Reuben Elizur the son of Shedeur 6 of Simeon Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai 7 of Judah Nahshon the son of Amminadab 8 of Issachar Nethanel the son of Zuar 9 of Zebulun Eliab the son of Helon 10 of the sons of Joseph from Ephraim Elishama the son of Ammihud from Manasseh Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur 11 of Benjamin Abidan the son of Gideoni 12 of Dan Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai 13 of Asher Pagiel the son of Ochran 14 of Gad Eliasaph the son of Deuel 15 of Naphtali Ahira the son of Enan 16 These are the ones summoned from the assembly They are the chieftains of the tribes of their fathers the heads of the thousands of Israel

47 But the Levites were not registered in among them by the tribe of their fathers 48 So Jehovah told Moses 49 Only the tribe of Levi you are not to register and you should not include the number of them along with the other Israelites 50 You should appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony and over all its utensils and over everything that belongs to it They will carry the tabernacle and all its utensils and they will minister at it and they are to camp around the tabernacle 51 Whenever the tabernacle is to be moved the Levites should take it down and when the tabernacle is to be reassembled the Levites should set it up and any unauthorized person who comes near should be put to death
52 Each Israelite should set up his tent in his assigned camp each man according to his three-tribe division by their companies 53 And the Levites should encamp around the tabernacle of the Testimony so that no indignation may arise against the assembly of the Israelites and the Levites must be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the Testimony
54 The people of Israel did all that Jehovah had commanded Moses They did just so
