1 When Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel he did not go away again to search for omens of doom but he turned his face to the wilderness 2 When Balaam raised his eyes and saw Israel encamped by his tribes then the spirit of God came upon him 3 He then spoke this proverbial saying
The saying of Balaam the son of Beor And the saying of a man whose eyes have been opened 4 The saying of the one hearing the word of God Who saw a vision of the Almighty Who has bowed down with his eyes uncovered
 5 How beautiful are your tents O Jacob Your tabernacles O Israel
 6 Like the valleys they have extended a long way Like gardens by the river Like aloes that Jehovah has planted Like cedars by the waters
 7 Water keeps trickling from his two leather buckets And his seed is sown by many waters
His king also will be greater than Agag And his kingdom will be exalted
 8 God is bringing him out of Egypt He is like the horns of a wild bull for them
He will consume the nations his oppressors And their bones he will gnaw and he will shatter them with his arrows
 9 He has crouched down he has lain down like the lion And like a lion who dares rouse him
Those blessing you are blessed And those cursing you are cursed
10 Then Balak became furious with Balaam Balak scornfully clapped his hands together and said to Balaam It was to put a curse on my enemies that I called you but now you have done nothing but bless them these three times 11 Now go home immediately I intended to honor you greatly but look Jehovah has deprived you of honor
12 Balaam replied to Balak Did I not say to the messengers you sent 13 If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold I could not of my own will do anything beyond the order of Jehovah whether good or bad I will only speak what Jehovah will tell me 14 And now I am going away to my people Come and let me advise you what this people will do to your people in the future 15 So he spoke this proverbial saying
The saying of Balaam the son of Beor And the saying of a man whose eyes have been opened 16 The saying of the one hearing the word of God And the one having the knowledge of the Most High A vision of the Almighty he sawWhile bowing down with his eyes uncovered
17 I will see him but not now I will behold him but not soon
A star will come out of Jacob And a scepter will rise out of Israel
And he will certainly break apart the forehead of MoabAnd the skull of all the sons of tumult
18 And Edom will become a possession Yes Seir the possession of his enemies While Israel is displaying his courage
19 And out of Jacob one will be subduing And he will destroy any survivor from the city
20 When he saw Amalek he continued his proverbial saying
Amalek was the first of the nations But in the end he will perish
21 When he saw the Kenites he continued his proverbial saying
Secure is your dwelling and set on the crag is your abode
22 But someone will burn Kain down
How long before Assyria carries you away captive
23 And he continued his proverbial saying
Woe Who will survive when God does this
24 Ships will come from the coast of Kittim And they will afflict Assyria And they will afflict Eber
But he too will utterly perish
25 Then Balaam got up and went and returned to his place Balak also went his own way
