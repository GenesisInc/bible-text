1 Jehovah then told Moses 2 Take vengeance for the Israelites on the Midianites Afterward you will be gathered to your people
3 So Moses spoke to the people saying Equip men from among you for battle against Midian and to execute Jehovahs vengeance on Midian 4 You should send 1000 of each tribe of all the tribes of Israel into the army 5 So from the thousands of Israel 1000 were assigned from each tribe 12000 equipped for battle
6 Then Moses sent them out 1000 from each tribe to the army along with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest for the army who had the holy utensils and the signal trumpets in his hand 7 They waged war against Midian just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and they killed every male 8 Along with the others slain they killed the kings of Midian namely Evi Rekem Zur Hur and Reba the five kings of Midian They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword 9 But the Israelites carried off captive the women and children of Midian They also plundered all their domestic animals all their livestock and all their possessions 10 And all their cities in which they had settled and all their encampments they burned with fire 11 And they took all the spoil and all the plunder both humans and animals 12 Then they brought the captives the plunder and the spoil to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the assembly of the Israelites to the camp in the desert plains of Moab near the Jordan at Jericho
13 Then Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chieftains of the assembly went out to meet them outside the camp 14 But Moses grew indignant at the appointed men of the combat forces the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds who were coming in from the military expedition 15 Moses said to them Have you preserved all the females alive 16 Look They are the ones who by Balaams word induced the Israelites to commit unfaithfulness toward Jehovah over the affair of Peor so that the scourge came upon the assembly of Jehovah 17 Now you should kill every male among the children and kill every woman who has had sexual relations with a man 18 But you may keep alive all the young girls who have not had sexual relations with a man 19 And you should camp outside the camp seven days Every one of you who has killed someone and every one of you who has touched someone slain should purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day you and your captives 20 And you should purify from sin every garment every article of skin everything made of goat hair and every article of wood
21 Eleazar the priest then said to the men of the army who had gone into the battle This is the statute of the law that Jehovah commanded Moses 22 Only the gold the silver the copper the iron the tin and the lead 23 everything that can be processed with fire you should pass through the fire and it will be clean However it should also be purified by the water for cleansing Everything that cannot be processed with fire you should pass through the water 24 And you should wash your garments on the seventh day and be clean and then you may come into the camp
25 Jehovah then said this to Moses 26 Take an inventory of the plunder counting the captives both of humans and animals do this together with Eleazar the priest and the heads of the paternal houses of the assembly 27 Divide what was plundered into two parts to be shared between those in the army who took part in the battle and all the rest of the assembly 28 As a tax for Jehovah you should take from the soldiers who went out into the battle one soul out of every 500 of the people the herd the donkeys and the flock 29 You should take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as Jehovahs contribution 30 From the half given to the Israelites you should take one out of 50 of the people the herd the donkeys the flock and every sort of domestic animal and give them to the Levites who care for the responsibilities connected with Jehovahs tabernacle
31 So Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses 32 The spoils the rest of the plunder that the people of the expedition had taken amounted to 675000 of the flock 33 72000 of the herd 34 and 61000 donkeys 35 The women who had not had sexual relations with a man amounted to 32000 women 36 The half that was the share of those who went out into the battle amounted to 337500 of the flock 37 The tax for Jehovah from the flock amounted to 675 38 And there were 36000 of the herd and the tax on them for Jehovah was 72 39 And there were 30500 donkeys and the tax on them for Jehovah was 61 40 And there were 16000 humans and the tax on them for Jehovah was 32 persons 41 Then Moses gave the tax as Jehovahs contribution to Eleazar the priest just as Jehovah had commanded Moses
42 From the half belonging to the Israelites which Moses had divided off from the portion that belonged to the men who waged war 43 that half of the flock amounted to 337500 44 and of the herd 36000 45 and of the donkeys 30500 46 and of the people 16000 47 Then Moses took from the half belonging to the Israelites one out of 50 of the people and of the animals and gave them to the Levites who cared for the responsibility of Jehovahs tabernacle just as Jehovah had commanded Moses
48 Then the appointed men who were of the thousands of the army the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds approached Moses 49 and they said to Moses Your servants have taken the count of the men of war who are under our command and not one has been reported missing from us 50 So let us each present what he has found as Jehovahs offering articles of gold ankle chains bracelets signet rings earrings and other jewelry in order to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah
51 So Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from them all the jewelry 52 All the gold of the contribution that they made to Jehovah amounted to 16750 shekels from the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds 53 The men of the army had each taken plunder for himself 54 Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a reminder for the people of Israel before Jehovah
