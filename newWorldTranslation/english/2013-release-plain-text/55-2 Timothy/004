1 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead and by his manifestation and his Kingdom 2 Preach the word be at it urgently in favorable times and difficult times reprove reprimand exhort with all patience and art of teaching 3 For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching but according to their own desires they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories 5 You though keep your senses in all things endure hardship do the work of an evangelizer fully accomplish your ministry
6 For I am already being poured out like a drink offering and the time for my releasing is imminent 7 I have fought the fine fight I have run the race to the finish I have observed the faith 8 From this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge will give me as a reward in that day yet not to me only but also to all those who have loved his manifestation
9 Do your utmost to come to me shortly 10 For Demas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things and he has gone to Thessalonica Crescens to Galatia Titus to Dalmatia 11 Only Luke is with me Bring Mark along with you for he is helpful to me in the ministry 12 But I have sent Tychicus off to Ephesus 13 When you come bring the cloak I left at Troas with Carpus and the scrolls especially the parchments
14 Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm Jehovah will repay him according to his deeds 15 You too should be on guard against him for he opposed our message to an excessive degree
16 In my first defense no one came to my side but they all forsook meâ€”may they not be held accountable 17 But the Lord stood near me and infused power into me so that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it and I was rescued from the lions mouth 18 The Lord will rescue me from every wicked work and will save me for his heavenly Kingdom To him be the glory forever and ever Amen
19 Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus
20 Erastus stayed in Corinth but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus 21 Do your utmost to arrive before winter
Eubulus sends you his greetings and so do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers
22 The Lord be with the spirit you show His undeserved kindness be with you
