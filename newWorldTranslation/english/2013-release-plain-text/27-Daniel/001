1 In the third year of the kingship of King Jehoiakim of Judah King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it 2 In time Jehovah gave King Jehoiakim of Judah into his hand along with some of the utensils of the house of the true God and he brought them to the land of Shinar to the house of his god He placed the utensils in the treasury of his god
3 Then the king ordered Ashpenaz his chief court official to bring some of the Israelites including those of royal and noble descent 4 They were to be youths without any defect of good appearance endowed with wisdom knowledge and discernment and capable of serving in the kings palace He was to teach them the writing and the language of the Chaldeans 5 Furthermore the king assigned to them a daily ration from the kings delicacies and from the wine he drank They were to be trained for three years and at the end of that time they were to enter the kings service
6 Now among them were some from the tribe of Judah Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah 7 And the principal court official assigned names to them he gave to Daniel the name Belteshazzar to Hananiah the name Shadrach to Mishael the name Meshach and to Azariah the name Abednego
8 But Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the kings delicacies or with the wine he drank So he asked the principal court official for permission not to defile himself in this way 9 And the true God caused the principal court official to show Daniel favor and mercy 10 But the principal court official said to Daniel I am afraid of my lord the king who has assigned your food and drink What if he should see you looking worse in appearance than the other youths of your age You would make me guilty before the king 11 But Daniel said to the guardian whom the principal court official had appointed over Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah 12 Please test your servants for ten days and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink 13 then compare our appearance with the appearance of the youths who are eating the kings delicacies and deal with your servants according to what you see
14 So he agreed to their proposal and tested them for ten days 15 At the end of ten days their appearance was better and healthier than all the youths who were eating the kings delicacies 16 So the guardian would take away their delicacies and their wine and give them vegetables 17 And the true God gave these four youths knowledge and insight into every kind of writing and wisdom and Daniel was given understanding in all sorts of visions and dreams
18 At the end of the time that the king had specified to bring them in the principal court official brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar 19 When the king spoke with them no one in the entire group was found to be like Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah and they continued to serve before the king 20 In every matter requiring wisdom and understanding that the king would ask them about he found them ten times better than all the magic-practicing priests and the conjurers in his entire realm 21 And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus
