1 So Jehovah said to Moses Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh A mighty hand will force him to send them away and a mighty hand will force him to drive them out of his land
2 Then God said to Moses I am Jehovah 3 And I used to appear to Abraham Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty but with regard to my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them 4 I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan the land in which they lived as foreigners 5 Now I myself have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians are enslaving and I remember my covenant
6 Therefore say to the Israelites I am Jehovah and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and rescue you from their slavery and I will reclaim you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments 7 And I will take you in as my people and I will be your God and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God who is bringing you out from under the burdens of Egypt 8 And I will bring you into the land that I swore with an oath to give to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I will give it to you as something to possess I am Jehovah
9 Moses later gave this message to the Israelites but they did not listen to Moses because of their discouragement and because of the harsh slavery
10 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses saying 11 Go in and tell Pharaoh Egypts king that he should send the Israelites away out of his land 12 However Moses replied to Jehovah Look The Israelites have not listened to me how will Pharaoh ever listen to me as I speak with difficulty 13 But Jehovah again told Moses and Aaron what commands to give to the Israelites and to Pharaoh Egypts king in order to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt

28 On that day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt 29 Jehovah told Moses I am Jehovah Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I am speaking to you 30 Then Moses said before Jehovah Look I speak with difficulty so how will Pharaoh ever listen to me
