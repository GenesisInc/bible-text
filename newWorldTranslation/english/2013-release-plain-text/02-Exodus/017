1 The entire assembly of the Israelites departed from the wilderness of Sin by stages according to the order of Jehovah and they camped at Rephidim But there was no water for the people to drink
2 So the people began quarreling with Moses and saying Give us water to drink But Moses said to them Why are you quarreling with me Why do you keep putting Jehovah to the test 3 But the people were very thirsty for water there and they kept murmuring against Moses and saying Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our sons and our livestock with thirst 4 Finally Moses cried out to Jehovah What should I do with this people A little longer and they will stone me
5 Then Jehovah said to Moses Go ahead of the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel and your rod with which you struck the Nile River Take it in your hand and walk on 6 Look I will be standing before you there on the rock in Horeb You must strike the rock and water will come out of it and the people will drink it Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel 7 So he named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarreling of the Israelites and because they put Jehovah to the test by saying Is Jehovah in our midst or not
8 Then the Amalekites came and fought against Israel in Rephidim 9 At this Moses said to Joshua Choose men for us and go out to fight against the Amalekites Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the rod of the true God in my hand 10 Then Joshua did just as Moses told him and he fought against the Amalekites And Moses Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill
11 As long as Moses kept his hands lifted up the Israelites prevailed but as soon as he would let down his hands the Amalekites prevailed 12 When the hands of Moses were heavy they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it Then Aaron and Hur one on each side supported his hands so that his hands remained steady until the sun set 13 Thus Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the sword
14 Jehovah now said to Moses Write this as a memorial in the book and repeat it to Joshua I will completely wipe out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens 15 Then Moses built an altar and named it Jehovah-nissi 16 saying Because his hand is against the throne of Jah Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation
