1 The word of Jehovah again came to me saying 2 Son of man turn your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them 3 You must say concerning the Ammonites Hear the word of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says Because you said Aha against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of Israel when it was laid desolate and against the house of Judah when they went into exile 4 therefore I am giving you to the people of the East as a possession They will set up their encampments within you and pitch their tents among you They will eat your fruitage and they will drink your milk 5 I will make Rabbah a pasture ground for camels and the land of the Ammonites a resting-place for the flock and you will have to know that I am Jehovah
6 For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says Because you clapped your hands and stamped your feet and you rejoiced over the land of Israel with such utter scorn 7 therefore I will stretch out my hand against you to give you to the nations as something to plunder I will cut you off from the peoples and destroy you from the lands I will annihilate you and you will have to know that I am Jehovah
8 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says Because Moab and Seir have said Look The house of Judah is like all the other nations  9 I am exposing Moabs flank at his frontier cities the beauty of his land Beth-jeshimoth Baal-meon and clear to Kiriathaim 10 I will give it along with the Ammonites as a possession to the people of the East so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations 11 And I will execute judgment in Moab and they will have to know that I am Jehovah
12 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says Edom has acted vengefully against the house of Judah and has incurred great guilt in taking revenge on them 13 therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says I will also stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it both man and livestock and I will make it desolate From Teman clear to Dedan they will fall by the sword 14 I will take vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel They will bring my anger and my wrath on Edom so that they experience my own vengeance  declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
15 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says Because of their unrelenting hostility the Philistines have maliciously sought to bring vengeance and destruction 16 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says Here I am stretching out my hand against the Philistines and I will cut off the Cherethites and will destroy the remaining inhabitants of the seacoast 17 I will execute on them great acts of vengeance with furious punishments and they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I bring my vengeance on them
