1 Now in the days when the judges administered justice a famine occurred in the land and a man went from Bethlehem in Judah to reside as a foreigner in the fields of Moab he along with his wife and his two sons 2 The mans name was Elimelech his wifes name was Naomi and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah And they came to the fields of Moab and remained there
3 After some time Elimelech Naomis husband died and she was left with her two sons 4 The men later married Moabite women one was named Orpah and the other was named Ruth They remained there for about ten years 5 Then the two sons Mahlon and Chilion also died and the woman was left without her two children and her husband 6 So she started out with her daughters-in-law to return from the fields of Moab for she had heard in Moab that Jehovah had turned his attention to his people by giving them food
7 She left the place where she had been living with both of her daughters-in-law As they were walking on the road to return to the land of Judah 8 Naomi said to both of her daughters-in-law Go return each of you to your mothers home May Jehovah show loyal love to you just as you have shown it to the men who have died and to me 9 May Jehovah grant that each of you finds security in the home of your husband Then she kissed them and they wept loudly 10 They kept saying to her No but we will go with you to your people 11 But Naomi said Return my daughters Why should you go with me Can I still give birth to sons who could become your husbands 12 Return my daughters Go for I have grown too old to marry Even if I could hope to find a husband tonight and could also bear sons 13 would you keep waiting for them until they could grow up Would you refrain from getting remarried for their sakes No my daughters I feel very bitter for you because the hand of Jehovah has turned against me
14 Again they wept loudly after which Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and departed But Ruth stuck with her 15 So Naomi said Look Your widowed sister-in-law has returned to her people and her gods Return with your sister-in-law
16 But Ruth said Do not plead with me to abandon you to turn back from accompanying you for where you go I will go and where you spend the night I will spend the night Your people will be my people and your God my God 17 Where you die I will die and there I will be buried May Jehovah do so to me and add to it if anything but death should separate me from you
18 When Naomi saw that Ruth insisted on going with her she stopped trying to convince her 19 And they both continued on their way until they came to Bethlehem As soon as they arrived in Bethlehem the whole city became stirred up over them and women were saying Is this Naomi 20 She would say to the women Do not call me Naomi Call me Mara for the Almighty has made life very bitter for me 21 I was full when I went but Jehovah made me return empty-handed Why should you call me Naomi when it is Jehovah who opposed me and the Almighty who caused me calamity
22 This is how Naomi returned from the fields of Moab along with her Moabite daughter-in-law Ruth They came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest
