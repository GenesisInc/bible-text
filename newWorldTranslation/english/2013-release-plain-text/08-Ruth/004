1 Now Boaz went up to the city gate and sat there And look the repurchaser whom Boaz had mentioned passed by At that Boaz said Come here and sit down So-and-so And he went over and sat down 2 Then Boaz took ten of the city elders and said Sit down here So they sat down
3 Boaz now said to the repurchaser Naomi who has returned from the fields of Moab must sell the plot of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech 4 So I thought I should disclose it to you and say Buy it in front of the inhabitants and the elders of my people If you will repurchase it repurchase it But if you will not repurchase it tell me so that I will know for you have the claim to repurchase it and I am next in line after you He replied I am willing to repurchase it 5 Then Boaz said On the day you buy the field from Naomi you must also buy it from Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the dead man in order to restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance 6 To this the repurchaser said I am unable to repurchase it for I may ruin my own inheritance Repurchase it for yourself with my right of repurchase because I am not able to repurchase it
7 Now this was the custom of former times in Israel concerning the right of repurchase and exchange to validate every sort of transaction A man had to remove his sandal and give it to the other party and this was the manner of confirming an agreement in Israel 8 So when the repurchaser said to Boaz Buy it for yourself  he removed his sandal 9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon 10 I am also acquiring Ruth the Moabitess the wife of Mahlon as a wife to restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance so that the name of the dead man will not be cut off from among his brothers and from the city gate of his home You are witnesses today
11 At this all the people who were in the city gate and the elders said We are witnesses May Jehovah grant the wife who is entering your house to be like Rachel and like Leah both of whom built the house of Israel May you prosper in Ephrathah and make a good name in Bethlehem 12 May your house become like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah through the offspring that Jehovah will give you by this young woman
13 So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife He had relations with her and Jehovah let her conceive and she gave birth to a son 14 Then the women said to Naomi Praised be Jehovah who has not left you without a repurchaser today May his name be proclaimed in Israel 15 He has restored your life and will sustain you in your old age because he has been born to your daughter-in-law who loves you and is better to you than seven sons 16 Naomi took the child and held him to her bosom and she cared for him 17 Then the neighbor women gave him a name They said A son has been born to Naomi  and they named him Obed He is the father of Jesse Davids father
18 Now this is the family line of Perez Perez became father to Hezron 19 Hezron became father to Ram Ram became father to Amminadab 20 Amminadab became father to Nahshon Nahshon became father to Salmon 21 Salmon became father to Boaz Boaz became father to Obed 22 Obed became father to Jesse and Jesse became father to David
