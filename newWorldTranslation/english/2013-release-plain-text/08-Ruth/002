1 Now Naomi had a relative on her husbands side who was very wealthy his name was Boaz and he was of the family of Elimelech
2 Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi Let me go out please to the fields and glean among the ears of grain behind whoever looks on me with favor So Naomi said to her Go my daughter 3 At that she went out and began to glean in the field behind the harvesters By chance she came upon a plot of land belonging to Boaz who was of the family of Elimelech 4 Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters Jehovah be with you And they replied Jehovah bless you
5 Boaz then asked the young man in charge of the harvesters To whom does this young woman belong 6 The young man in charge of the harvesters answered The young woman is a Moabitess who returned with Naomi from the fields of Moab 7 She asked Please may I glean and gather among the cut-off ears of grain left behind by the harvesters And she has been on her feet since she came this morning until just now when she sat in the shelter for a short rest
8 Then Boaz said to Ruth Listen my daughter Do not go away to glean in another field and do not go anywhere else stay close by my young women 9 Keep your eyes on the field that they harvest and go with them I have commanded the young men not to touch you When you are thirsty go to the water jars and drink from what the young men have drawn
10 At that she fell facedown and bowed down to the ground and said to him How have I found favor in your eyes and why have you taken notice of me when I am a foreigner 11 Boaz answered her A full report was made to me of all you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your relatives to go to a people whom you had not known before 12 May Jehovah reward you for what you have done and may there be a perfect wage for you from Jehovah the God of Israel under whose wings you have come to seek refuge 13 To this she said Let me find favor in your eyes my lord because you have comforted me and spoken reassuringly to your servant although I am not even one of your servants
14 Boaz said to her at mealtime Come here eat some of the bread and dip your piece in the vinegar So she sat down beside the harvesters He then handed her some roasted grain and she ate and was satisfied and she had something left over 15 When she got up to glean Boaz commanded his young men Let her glean even among the cut-off ears of grain and do not mistreat her 16 You should also be sure to pull out some ears of grain from the bundles for her and leave them behind for her to glean and do not say anything to stop her
17 So she continued to glean in the field until evening When she beat out what she had gleaned it came to about an ephah of barley 18 Then she took it and went into the city and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned Ruth also took out and gave to her the food that was left over after she had eaten her fill
19 Her mother-in-law then said to her Where did you glean today Where did you work May the one who took notice of you be blessed So she told her mother-in-law about whom she had worked with saying The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz 20 At that Naomi said to her daughter-in-law May he be blessed by Jehovah who has not failed in his loyal love toward the living and the dead Naomi continued The man is related to us He is one of our repurchasers 21 Then Ruth the Moabitess said He also told me Stay close by my young people until they have finished my entire harvest 22 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth It is better my daughter for you to go out with his young women than to be harassed in another field
23 So she stayed close to the young women of Boaz and gleaned until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest came to an end And she kept dwelling with her mother-in-law
