1 The war between the house of Saul and the house of David dragged on and David kept getting stronger and the house of Saul grew steadily weaker
2 Meanwhile sons were born to David in Hebron His firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam of Jezreel 3 His second was Chileab by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite and the third was Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur 4 The fourth was Adonijah the son of Haggith and the fifth was Shephatiah the son of Abital 5 The sixth was Ithream by Davids wife Eglah These were born to David in Hebron
6 While the war between the house of Saul and the house of David continued Abner kept strengthening his position in the house of Saul 7 Now Saul had had a concubine whose name was Rizpah the daughter of Aiah Ish-bosheth later said to Abner Why did you have relations with the concubine of my father 8 Abner grew very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said Am I a dogs head from Judah Until this very day I have shown loyal love toward the house of your father Saul and to his brothers and his friends and I have not betrayed you into the hand of David yet today you call me to account for an error concerning a woman 9 May God do so to Abner and add to it if I do not do for David just as Jehovah swore to him 10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan to Beer-sheba 11 He was not able to say one more word in reply to Abner for he was afraid of him
12 Abner immediately sent messengers to David saying To whom does the land belong He added Make a covenant with me and I will do whatever I can to turn all Israel to your side 13 To this he replied Good I will make a covenant with you The only thing I ask of you is that you do not try to see my face unless first you bring Michal Sauls daughter when you come to see me 14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Sauls son saying Give me my wife Michal to whom I became engaged for 100 foreskins of the Philistines 15 So Ish-bosheth sent to take her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish 16 But her husband kept walking with her weeping as he followed her as far as Bahurim Then Abner said to him Go return At that he returned
17 Meanwhile Abner sent word to the elders of Israel saying For some time you wanted to have David as king over you 18 Now act for Jehovah said to David By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies 19 Then Abner spoke to the people of Benjamin Abner also went to speak privately to David at Hebron to tell him what Israel and the whole house of Benjamin had agreed upon
20 When Abner came to David at Hebron with 20 men David held a feast for Abner and for the men with him 21 Then Abner said to David Let me go and gather all Israel together to my lord the king so that they may make a covenant with you and you will become king over all that you desire So David sent Abner off and he went his way in peace
22 Just then Davids servants and Joab returned from a raid bringing a great quantity of spoil back with them Abner was no longer with David in Hebron for he had sent him on his way in peace 23 When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived Joab was told Abner the son of Ner came to the king and he sent him off and he went his way in peace 24 So Joab went in to the king and said What have you done Here Abner came to you Why did you send him off so that he successfully got away 25 You know Abner the son of Ner He came here to fool you and to get to know your every move and to find out everything that you are doing
26 So Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah but David did not know anything about it 27 When Abner returned to Hebron Joab took him aside inside the gate to speak with him privately However there he stabbed him in the abdomen and he died this was for killing his brother Asahel 28 When David heard about it later he said I and my kingdom are forever innocent before Jehovah of the bloodguilt for Abner the son of Ner 29 May it turn back on the head of Joab and on the entire house of his father May Joabs house never be without a man suffering from a discharge or a leper or a man working at the spindle or one falling by the sword or one in need of food 30 So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had put Asahel their brother to death in the battle at Gibeon
31 Then David said to Joab and all the people with him Rip your garments apart and tie on sackcloth and wail over Abner King David himself was walking behind the funeral bier 32 They buried Abner in Hebron and the king wept loudly at Abners tomb and all the people gave way to weeping 33 The king chanted over Abner and said
Should Abner die the death of a senseless person
34 Your hands had not been bound And your feet were not in fetters
You fell like one falling before criminals
At that all the people wept over him again
35 Later all the people came to give David bread for consolation while it was still daytime but David swore May God do so to me and add to it if before the sun sets I taste bread or anything at all 36 All the people took notice and it pleased them Like everything that the king did it pleased all the people 37 So all the people and all Israel knew on that day that the king was not responsible for having Abner the son of Ner put to death 38 Then the king said to his servants Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel 39 Today I am weak although anointed as king and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too brutal for me May Jehovah repay the evildoer according to his own evil
