1 David then said Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I may show loyal love for the sake of Jonathan 2 Now there was a servant of the house of Saul named Ziba So they called him to David and the king asked him Are you Ziba He replied I am your servant 3 The king continued Is there anyone left of the house of Saul to whom I may extend Gods loyal love Ziba replied to the king There is still one son of Jonathan he is crippled in both feet 4 The king asked him Where is he Ziba replied to the king He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel at Lo-debar
5 King David immediately sent for him and took him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel at Lo-debar 6 When Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul came in to David he at once fell facedown and prostrated himself Then David said Mephibosheth to which he replied Here is your servant 7 David said to him Do not be afraid for I will certainly show loyal love to you for the sake of your father Jonathan and I will return to you all the land of Saul your grandfather and you will always dine at my table
8 At that he prostrated himself and said What is your servant that you have turned your attention to a dead dog like me 9 The king now sent for Ziba Sauls attendant and said to him Everything that belonged to Saul and to all his house I give to the grandson of your master 10 You will cultivate the land for him—you and your sons and your servants—and you will gather its produce to provide food for those who belong to the grandson of your master to eat But Mephibosheth the grandson of your master will always dine at my table
Now Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants 11 Then Ziba said to the king Your servant will do all that my lord the king commands his servant to do So Mephibosheth ate at Davids table like one of the sons of the king 12 Now Mephibosheth also had a young son named Mica and all those who lived in Zibas house became servants of Mephibosheth 13 And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem for he always ate at the table of the king and he was crippled in both feet
