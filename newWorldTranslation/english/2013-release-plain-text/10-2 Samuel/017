1 Ahithophel then said to Absalom Please let me choose 12000 men and rise up and chase after David tonight 2 I will come upon him when he is weary and powerless and I will throw him into a panic and all the people who are with him will flee and I will strike down only the king 3 Then I will bring all the people back to you The return of all the people depends on what happens with the man you are seeking Then all the people will be at peace 4 The proposal was just right in the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel
5 However Absalom said Please call Hushai the Archite as well and let us hear what he has to say 6 So Hushai came in to Absalom Then Absalom said to him This is the advice Ahithophel gave Should we act on his advice If not you tell us 7 At this Hushai said to Absalom The advice that Ahithophel gave is not good in this instance
8 Hushai continued You well know that your father and his men are mighty and they are desperate like a bear that has lost her cubs in the field Moreover your father is a warrior and he will not spend the night with the people 9 At this very moment he is hiding in one of the caves or in some other place and if he attacks first those hearing of it will say The people following Absalom have been defeated 10 Even the courageous man whose heart is like that of a lion will surely melt in fear for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and that the men with him are courageous 11 I give this advice Let all Israel be gathered to you from Dan to Beer-sheba as many as the grains of sand by the sea and you should lead them into the fight 12 We will come against him wherever he is found and we will come upon him just like the dew that falls on the ground and not one of them will survive not he nor any of the men with him 13 If he retreats into a city all Israel will carry ropes to that city and we will drag it down into the valley until not even a pebble is left
14 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than the advice of Ahithophel For Jehovah had determined to frustrate the sound advice of Ahithophel so that Jehovah could bring disaster on Absalom
15 Hushai later said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests This is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel and this is what I have advised 16 Now quickly send word to David and warn him Do not stay at the fords of the wilderness tonight but cross over without fail or the king and all the people with him may be wiped out
17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel so a servant girl went off and told them and they went to tell King David for they did not dare to be seen entering the city 18 However a young man saw them and told Absalom So the two of them quickly went off and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a well in his courtyard They went down into it 19 and the mans wife spread a covering over the top of the well and covered it with cracked grain no one knew about it 20 The servants of Absalom came to the woman at her house and asked Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan The woman replied They passed by toward the water Then the men searched for them but did not find them so they returned to Jerusalem
21 After the men were gone they came up out of the well and went and informed King David They said to him Rise up and quickly cross the water for this is what Ahithophel advised against you 22 Immediately David and all the people with him rose up and crossed the Jordan By daybreak there was no one left who had not crossed the Jordan
23 When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been acted on he saddled a donkey and went to his house in his hometown After he gave instructions to his household he hanged himself So he died and was buried in the burial place of his forefathers
24 Meanwhile David went to Mahanaim and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel 25 Absalom put Amasa in charge of the army in place of Joab Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Israelite who had relations with Abigail the daughter of Nahash the sister of Zeruiah Joabs mother 26 Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead
27 As soon as David came to Mahanaim Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 28 brought beds basins clay pots wheat barley flour roasted grain broad beans lentils parched grain 29 honey butter sheep and cheese They brought all of this out for David and the people with him to eat for they said The people are hungry and tired and thirsty in the wilderness
