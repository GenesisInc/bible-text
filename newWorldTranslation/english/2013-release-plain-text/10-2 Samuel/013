1 Now Davids son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar and Davids son Amnon fell in love with her 2 Amnon was so distressed that he became sick because of his sister Tamar for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible for Amnon to do anything to her 3 Now Amnon had a companion named Jehonadab the son of Shimeah Davids brother and Jehonadab was a very clever man 4 So he said to him Why are you the kings son so depressed every morning Why not tell me Amnon replied to him I am in love with Tamar the sister of my brother Absalom 5 Jehonadab replied to him Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick When your father comes to see you say to him Please let my sister Tamar come and serve me some food If she prepares the food given to the sick before my eyes I will eat it from her hand
6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick and the king came in to see him Then Amnon said to the king Please let my sister Tamar come in and bake two heart-shaped cakes before my eyes so that I may take food from her hand 7 At that David sent a message to Tamar at the house saying Please go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare food for him 8 So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon where he was lying down She took the dough and kneaded it into cakes before his eyes and cooked the cakes 9 Then she took the pan and served him But Amnon refused to eat and said Have everybody leave me So everybody left him
10 Amnon now said to Tamar Bring the food into the bedroom so that I may eat it from your hand So Tamar took the heart-shaped cakes that she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in the bedroom 11 When she brought them for him to eat he grabbed her and said Come lie down with me my sister 12 But she said to him No my brother Do not humiliate me for such a thing is not done in Israel Do not do this disgraceful thing 13 How could I live down my shame And you will be regarded as one of the disgraceful men in Israel Now speak please to the king for he will not withhold me from you 14 But he refused to listen to her and he overpowered her and humiliated her by raping her 15 Then Amnon began hating her with a very intense hatred so that his hatred for her became greater than the love he had felt for her Amnon said to her Get up go away 16 At this she said to him No my brother for sending me away now is worse than what you have done with me But he refused to listen to her
17 With that he called his young attendant and said Get this person out of my presence please and lock the door behind her 18 Now she was wearing a special robe for those were the garments that the virgin daughters of the king wore So his attendant led her outside and he locked the door behind her 19 Then Tamar put ashes on her head and she ripped apart the fine robe she was wearing and she kept her hands on her head and walked off crying out as she walked
20 At this her brother Absalom asked her Was it your brother Amnon who was with you And now keep silent my sister He is your brother Do not let your heart dwell on this matter Then Tamar lived in isolation at the house of her brother Absalom 21 When King David heard about all these things he became very angry But he would not hurt the feelings of Amnon his son because he loved him for he was his firstborn 22 And Absalom said nothing to Amnon either bad or good for Absalom hated Amnon because he had humiliated his sister Tamar
23 After two full years Absaloms sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor near Ephraim and Absalom invited all the sons of the king 24 So Absalom came in to the king and said Your servant is having his sheep sheared Please let the king and his servants go with me 25 But the king said to Absalom No my son If all of us go we will be a burden to you Although he kept urging him he did not consent to go but he blessed him 26 Absalom then said If not you please let my brother Amnon go with us The king replied to him Why should he go with you 27 But Absalom urged him so he sent Amnon and all the kings sons with him
28 Then Absalom ordered his attendants Watch and when Amnons heart is in a cheerful mood from the wine I will say to you Strike down Amnon You must then put him to death Do not be afraid Is it not I who command you Be strong and courageous 29 So Absaloms attendants did to Amnon exactly as Absalom had ordered then all the other sons of the king got up and each one mounted his mule and fled 30 While they were on the way the report reached David Absalom has struck down all the sons of the king and not one of them survived 31 At this the king got up and ripped his clothes apart and lay on the ground and all his servants were standing by with their garments ripped apart
32 However Jehonadab the son of Shimeah Davids brother said Do not let my lord think that they have killed all the young sons of the king for only Amnon has died This is by the order of Absalom who decided to do this from the day that Amnon humiliated his sister Tamar 33 Now do not let my lord the king pay attention to the report that says All the kings sons have died only Amnon has died
34 Meanwhile Absalom ran away Later the watchman raised his eyes and saw that there were many people coming from the road behind him next to the mountain 35 At this Jehonadab said to the king Look The kings sons have returned It is just as your servant said 36 As he finished speaking the kings sons came in weeping loudly also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly 37 But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud the king of Geshur David mourned his son for many days 38 After Absalom fled and went to Geshur he stayed there for three years
39 Finally King David longed to go to Absalom for he had become reconciled to the death of Amnon
