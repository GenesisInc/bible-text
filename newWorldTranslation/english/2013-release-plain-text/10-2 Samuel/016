1 When David had passed a little beyond the summit Ziba the attendant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him with a couple of saddled donkeys and on them were 200 loaves of bread 100 cakes of raisins 100 cakes of summer fruit and a large jar of wine 2 Then the king said to Ziba Why have you brought these things Ziba replied The donkeys are for the household of the king to ride the bread and the summer fruit are for the young men to eat and the wine is for those who get exhausted in the wilderness to drink 3 The king now said And where is the son of your master At this Ziba said to the king He is staying in Jerusalem for he said Today the house of Israel will give back the royal rule of my father to me 4 The king then said to Ziba Look Everything that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours Ziba replied I bow down before you May I find favor in your eyes my lord the king
5 When King David reached Bahurim a man of the family of Sauls house named Shimei the son of Gera came out shouting curses as he approached 6 He was throwing stones at David and at all the servants of King David as well as at all the people and the mighty men on his right and on his left 7 Shimei said as he cursed Get out get out you bloodguilty man You worthless man 8 Jehovah has brought back on you all the bloodguilt for the house of Saul in whose place you have ruled as king but Jehovah gives the kingship into the hand of Absalom your son Now calamity has overtaken you because you are a bloodguilty man
9 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king Let me go over please and take off his head 10 But the king said What do I have to do with you you sons of Zeruiah Let him curse me for Jehovah has said to him Curse David So who should say Why are you doing this 11 David then said to Abishai and all his servants Here my own son who came from my own body is seeking my life and how much more now a Benjaminite Leave him alone so that he may curse me for Jehovah told him to 12 Perhaps Jehovah will see my affliction and Jehovah will restore goodness to me instead of the curses shouted at me this day 13 With that David and his men kept going down the road while Shimei was walking alongside the mountain abreast of him shouting curses and throwing stones and a lot of dust
14 At length the king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted and they refreshed themselves
15 Meanwhile Absalom and all the men of Israel arrived in Jerusalem and Ahithophel was with him 16 When Hushai the Archite Davids friend came in to Absalom Hushai said to Absalom Long live the king Long live the king 17 At this Absalom said to Hushai Is this your loyal love toward your friend Why did you not go with your friend 18 So Hushai said to Absalom No I am on the side of the one who has been chosen by Jehovah this people and all the men of Israel I will stay with him 19 And again I say Whom should I serve Should it not be his son Just as I served your father so I will serve you
20 Absalom then said to Ahithophel Give me your advice What should we do 21 At that Ahithophel said to Absalom Have relations with your fathers concubines those whom he left behind to take care of the house Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father and those who support you will be strengthened 22 So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof and Absalom had relations with the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel
23 In those days the advice that Ahithophel gave was considered as the word of the true God That was how all the advice of Ahithophel was esteemed both by David and by Absalom
