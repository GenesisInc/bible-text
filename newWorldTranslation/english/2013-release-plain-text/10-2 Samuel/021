1 Now there was a famine in the days of David for three consecutive years so David consulted Jehovah and Jehovah said There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house because he put the Gibeonites to death 2 So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them Incidentally the Gibeonites were not Israelites but Amorites who remained and the Israelites had sworn to spare them but Saul sought to strike them down in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah 3 David said to the Gibeonites What should I do for you and how can I make atonement so that you will bless the inheritance of Jehovah 4 The Gibeonites said to him It is not a matter of silver or gold for us in connection with Saul and his household nor can we put any man to death in Israel At that he said Whatever you say I will do for you 5 They said to the king The man who exterminated us and schemed to annihilate us from living anywhere in the territory of Israelâ€” 6 let seven of his sons be given to us We will hang their dead bodies before Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul the chosen one of Jehovah The king then said I will hand them over
7 However the king showed compassion for Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul because of the oath made before Jehovah between David and Jonathan the son of Saul 8 So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah whom she bore to Saul and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite 9 Then he handed them over to the Gibeonites and they hung their dead bodies on the mountain before Jehovah All seven of them died together they were put to death in the first days of harvest at the start of the barley harvest 10 Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out on the rock from the start of harvest until rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies she did not allow the birds of the heavens to land on them by day nor the wild beasts of the field to come near by night
11 David was told what Sauls concubine Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had done 12 So David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the leaders of Jabesh-gilead who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hung them on the day that the Philistines struck down Saul on Gilboa 13 He brought the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan up from there and they also gathered the bones of the men who had been executed 14 Then they buried the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin in Zela in the tomb of Kish his father After they did everything that the king had commanded God listened to their entreaties for the land
15 Once again there was war between the Philistines and Israel So David and his servants went down and fought the Philistines but David became exhausted 16 A descendant of the Rephaim named Ishbi-benob whose copper spear weighed 300 shekels and who was armed with a new sword intended to strike David down 17 At once Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid and struck the Philistine down and put him to death At that time the men of David swore this oath to him You must not go out with us to battle anymore You must not extinguish the lamp of Israel
18 After this war broke out again with the Philistines at Gob At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph who was a descendant of the Rephaim
19 And war broke out again with the Philistines at Gob and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite struck down Goliath the Gittite whose spear had a shaft like the beam of loom workers
20 War broke out yet again at Gath where there was a man of extraordinary size with 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot 24 in all and he too was a descendant of the Rephaim 21 He kept taunting Israel So Jonathan the son of Shimei Davids brother struck him down
22 These four were descendants of the Rephaim in Gath and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants
