1 The anger of Jehovah again blazed against Israel when one incited David against them saying Go take a count of Israel and Judah 2 So the king said to Joab the chief of the army who was with him Please go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba and register the people so that I may know the number of the people 3 But Joab said to the king May Jehovah your God multiply the people 100 times and may the eyes of my lord the king see it but why does my lord the king want to do such a thing
4 But the kings word prevailed over Joab and the chiefs of the army So Joab and the chiefs of the army went out from before the king to register the people of Israel 5 They crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer to the right of the city in the middle of the valley toward the Gadites and on to Jazer 6 After that they went on to Gilead and the land of Tahtim-hodshi and continued to Dan-jaan and went around to Sidon 7 Then they went to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites and finally they ended up in the Negeb of Judah at Beer-sheba 8 Thus they went through all the land and came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and 20 days 9 Joab now gave to the king the number of the people who were registered Israel amounted to 800000 warriors armed with swords and the men of Judah were 500000
10 But Davids heart was struck with remorse after he had numbered the people David then said to Jehovah I have sinned greatly by doing this And now Jehovah please forgive your servants error for I have acted very foolishly 11 When David got up in the morning Jehovahs word came to Gad the prophet Davids visionary saying 12 Go and say to David This is what Jehovah says I am giving you three options Choose the one that I should bring on you 13 So Gad came in to David and told him Should seven years of famine come on your land Or should you flee for three months from your adversaries while they pursue you Or should there be three days of pestilence in your land Now consider carefully what I should reply to the One who sent me 14 So David said to Gad It is very distressing to me Let us fall please into the hand of Jehovah for his mercy is great but do not let me fall into the hand of man
15 Then Jehovah sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the designated time so that 70000 of the people from Dan to Beer-sheba died 16 When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it Jehovah felt regret over the calamity and he said to the angel bringing destruction among the people It is enough Now let your hand drop Jehovahs angel was close to the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite
17 When David saw the angel who was striking the people down he said to Jehovah I am the one who sinned and I am the one who did wrong but these sheepâ€”what have they done Let your hand please come against me and my fathers house
18 So Gad came in to David on that day and said to him Go up set up for Jehovah an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite 19 So David went up at the word of Gad as Jehovah had commanded 20 When Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants coming toward him Araunah immediately went out and bowed down to the king with his face to the ground 21 Araunah asked Why has my lord the king come to his servant David replied To buy from you the threshing floor in order to build an altar to Jehovah so that the scourge against the people may be halted 22 But Araunah said to David Let my lord the king take it and offer up what seems good to him Here are cattle for the burnt offering and the threshing sledge and the equipment of the cattle for the wood 23 All of this O king Araunah gives to the king Then Araunah said to the king May Jehovah your God show you favor
24 However the king said to Araunah No I must buy it from you for a price I will not offer up to Jehovah my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing So David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for 50 silver shekels 25 And David built an altar there to Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices Jehovah then responded to the entreaty for the land and the scourge against Israel was halted
