1 Now there was a troublemaker named Sheba the son of Bichri a Benjaminite He blew the horn and said We have no share in David and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse Everyone to his gods O Israel 2 At that all the men of Israel quit following David to follow Sheba the son of Bichri but the men of Judah stuck to their king from the Jordan to Jerusalem
3 When David came to his house at Jerusalem the king took the ten concubines he had left behind to take care of the house and he put them in a house under guard He supplied food to them but he did not have any relations with them They remained in confinement until the day of their death living as if they were widows even though they had a living husband
4 The king now said to Amasa Call the men of Judah together to me within three days and you also should be here 5 So Amasa went to call Judah together but he came later than the set time that had been appointed for him 6 Then David said to Abishai Sheba the son of Bichri may do us more harm than Absalom did Take the servants of your lord and chase after him so that he may not find fortified cities and escape from us 7 So the men of Joab the Cherethites the Pelethites and all the mighty men went out after him they left Jerusalem to chase after Sheba the son of Bichri 8 When they were near the great stone in Gibeon Amasa came to meet them Now Joab was wearing his battle clothing and he had a sword in its sheath strapped to his hip When he stepped forward the sword fell out
9 Joab said to Amasa Are you all right my brother Then with his right hand Joab took hold of Amasas beard as if to kiss him 10 Amasa was not on guard against the sword that was in Joabs hand and Joab stabbed him with it in the abdomen and his intestines spilled out on the ground He did not have to stab him again once was enough to kill him Then Joab and his brother Abishai chased after Sheba the son of Bichri
11 One of Joabs young men stood by him and was saying Whoever is on Joabs side and whoever belongs to David let him follow Joab 12 All the while Amasa was wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road When the man saw that all the people were stopping he moved Amasa from the road to the field Then he threw a garment over him because he saw that everyone was stopping when they came up to him 13 After he had removed him from the road all the men followed Joab to chase after Sheba the son of Bichri
14 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah The Bichrites gathered together and also went in after him
15 Joab and his men came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah and raised up a siege rampart against the city as it was standing within a rampart And all the men with Joab were undermining the wall to knock it down 16 And a wise woman called out from the city Listen men listen Please tell Joab Come here and let me speak to you 17 So he went near to her and the woman said Are you Joab He replied I am At this she said to him Listen to the words of your servant He said I am listening 18 She continued They would always say in the past Let them inquire in Abel and that was the end of the matter 19 I represent the peaceable and faithful ones of Israel You are seeking to destroy a city that is like a mother in Israel Why should you do away with the inheritance of Jehovah 20 Joab answered It is unthinkable for me to do away with it and destroy it 21 That is not the case at all Rather a man named Sheba the son of Bichri from the mountainous region of Ephraim has rebelled against King David If you hand over this one man I will withdraw from the city Then the woman said to Joab Look His head will be thrown over the wall to you
22 At once the wise woman went in to all the people and they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab At that he blew the horn and they dispersed from the city each one to his home and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king
23 Now Joab was in charge of all the army of Israel Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites 24 Adoram was over those conscripted for forced labor Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder 25 Sheva was the secretary Zadok and Abiathar were priests 26 And Ira the Jairite also became a chief minister for David
