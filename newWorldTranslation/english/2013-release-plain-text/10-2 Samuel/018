1 Then David numbered the men who were with him and placed over them chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds 2 And David sent one third of the men under the command of Joab one third under the command of Joabs brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite The king then said to the men I will also go out with you 3 But they said You must not go out for if we flee they would not care about us and if half of us would die they would not care about us because you are worth 10000 of us Therefore it would be better if you would send us help from the city 4 The king said to them Whatever seems best to you I will do So the king stood next to the city gate and all the men went out by hundreds and by thousands 5 Then the king gave Joab and Abishai and Ittai this order Deal gently with the young man Absalom for my sake All the men heard it when the king gave all the chiefs the order about Absalom
6 The men went out to the field to meet Israel and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim 7 There the people of Israel were defeated by the servants of David and a great slaughter took place on that dayâ€”20000 men 8 The battle spread through the whole region Furthermore the forest devoured more of the people than the sword did on that day
9 Absalom eventually found himself facing the servants of David Absalom was riding on a mule and the mule went under the thick branches of a large tree and his head got entangled in the big tree so that he was suspended in midair while the mule he had been riding kept going 10 Then someone saw it and told Joab Look I have seen Absalom hanging in a big tree 11 Joab replied to the man who told him If you saw it why did you not strike him down to the ground on the spot Then I would have gladly given you ten pieces of silver and a belt 12 But the man said to Joab Even if I were handed 1000 pieces of silver I could not lift my hand against the kings son for we heard the king order you and Abishai and Ittai Whoever you are watch over the young man Absalom 13 If I had disobeyed and taken his life it could never have remained hidden from the king and you would not have protected me 14 To this Joab said I am not going to waste any more time with you So he took three spikes in his hand and drove them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the midst of the big tree 15 Then ten attendants who carried Joabs weapons came and struck Absalom until he was dead 16 Joab now blew the horn and the men returned from chasing after Israel Joab called for them to halt 17 They took Absalom and threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up over him a very big heap of stones And all Israel fled to their homes
18 Now Absalom while he was alive had taken and set up for himself a pillar in the Valley of the King for he said I have no son to preserve the memory of my name So he named the pillar after himself and it is called Absaloms Monument to this day
19 Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said Let me run please and break the news to the king for Jehovah has given him justice by freeing him from his enemies 20 But Joab said to him You will not be a bearer of news this day You may break the news on another day but today you will not break the news because the kings own son has died 21 Then Joab said to a Cushite Go tell the king what you have seen At that the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran off 22 Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said once again to Joab Whatever happens please let me also run behind the Cushite However Joab said Why should you run my son when there is no news for you to tell 23 Still he said Whatever happens let me run So Joab said to him Run And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the district of the Jordan and he eventually overtook the Cushite
24 Now David was sitting between the two city gates and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall He looked up and saw a man running by himself 25 So the watchman called out and told the king The king said If he is by himself he has news to tell As he came steadily nearer 26 the watchman saw another man running The watchman then called to the gatekeeper Look Another man running by himself The king said This one is also bringing news 27 The watchman said I can see that the first man runs like Ahimaaz the son of Zadok  so the king said He is a good man and he comes with good news 28 Ahimaaz then called out to the king All is well With that he bowed to the king with his face to the ground Then he said May Jehovah your God be praised who has surrendered the men who rebelled against my lord the king
29 However the king said Is everything all right with the young man Absalom To this Ahimaaz said I saw the great commotion when Joab sent the kings servant and your servant but I did not know what it was 30 So the king said Step aside stand here At that he stepped aside and stood there
31 Then the Cushite arrived and the Cushite said Let my lord the king accept this news Today Jehovah has brought justice by freeing you from the hand of all those who rebelled against you 32 But the king said to the Cushite Is everything all right with the young man Absalom To this the Cushite said May all the enemies of my lord the king and all those who rebelled against you to harm you become like the young man
33 This disturbed the king and he went up to the roof chamber over the gateway and wept saying as he walked My son Absalom my son my son Absalom If only I had died instead of you Absalom my son my son
