1 In time all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said Look We are your own bone and flesh 2 In times past while Saul was our king you were the one who was leading Israel on its campaigns And Jehovah said to you You will shepherd my people Israel and you will become leader over Israel 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah Then they anointed David as king over Israel
4 David was 30 years old when he became king and he reigned for 40 years 5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah for 7 years and 6 months and in Jerusalem he reigned for 33 years over all Israel and Judah 6 And the king and his men set out for Jerusalem against the Jebusites who were inhabiting the land They taunted David You will never come in here Even the blind and the lame will drive you away They thought David will never get in here 7 However David captured the stronghold of Zion which is now the City of David 8 So David said on that day Those who attack the Jebusites should go through the water tunnel to strike down both the lame and the blind  who are hateful to David That is why it is said The blind and the lame will never enter the house 9 Then David took up residence in the stronghold and it was called the City of David and David began to build all around from the Mound inward 10 Thus David became greater and greater and Jehovah the God of armies was with him
11 King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David also cedar timbers woodworkers and stonemasons for building walls and they began to build a house for David 12 And David knew that Jehovah had firmly established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel
13 David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem after he came from Hebron and more sons and daughters were born to David 14 These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem Shammua Shobab Nathan Solomon 15 Ibhar Elishua Nepheg Japhia 16 Elishama Eliada and Eliphelet
17 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over Israel all the Philistines came up to search for David When David heard about it he went down to the stronghold 18 Then the Philistines came in and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim 19 David inquired of Jehovah saying Should I go up against the Philistines Will you give them into my hand At this Jehovah said to David Go up for I will surely give the Philistines into your hand 20 So David came to Baal-perazim and David struck them down there At that he said Jehovah has broken through my enemies before me like a breach made by waters That is why he named that place Baal-perazim 21 The Philistines abandoned their idols there and David and his men took them away
22 Later the Philistines came up once again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim 23 David inquired of Jehovah but He said Do not go directly up Instead go around behind them and come against them in front of the baca bushes 24 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baca bushes then act decisively for Jehovah will have gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines 25 So David did just as Jehovah commanded him and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer
