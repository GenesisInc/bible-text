1 After all these things Absalom acquired for himself a chariot and horses and 50 men to run before him 2 Absalom would rise up early and stand at the side of the road to the city gate Whenever any man had a legal case that was to come to the king for judgment Absalom would call him and say From what city are you and he would say Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel 3 Absalom would say to him See your claims are right and proper but there is no one from the king to hear your case 4 Absalom would say If only I were appointed judge in the land Then every man who has a legal case or judgment could come to me and I would see that he receives justice
5 And when a man came near to bow down to him Absalom would extend his hand and grab hold of him and kiss him 6 Absalom would do this to all the Israelites who would come in to the king for judgment so Absalom kept stealing the hearts of the men of Israel
7 At the end of four years Absalom said to the king Let me go please to Hebron to pay my vow that I made to Jehovah 8 For your servant made this solemn vow when I was dwelling in Geshur in Syria If Jehovah will bring me back to Jerusalem I will make an offering to Jehovah 9 So the king said to him Go in peace With that he rose up and went to Hebron
10 Absalom now sent spies through all the tribes of Israel saying As soon as you hear the sound of the horn announce Absalom has become king in Hebron 11 Now 200 men from Jerusalem had gone there with Absalom they were invited and went unsuspectingly unaware of what was happening 12 Further when he offered the sacrifices Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite Davids adviser from his city Giloh The conspiracy kept gaining momentum and the people who supported Absalom were growing in number
13 In time an informer came to David saying The heart of the men of Israel has turned to Absalom 14 At once David said to all his servants with him in Jerusalem Get up and let us run away for none of us will escape from Absalom Hurry for fear he may quickly overtake us and bring disaster on us and strike the city with the sword 15 The kings servants replied to the king Whatever my lord the king decides your servants are ready to do 16 So the king went out with all his household following him but the king left ten concubines to take care of the house 17 And the king continued on his way out with all the people following and they stopped at Beth-merhak
18 All his servants leaving with him and all the Cherethites the Pelethites and the Gittites 600 men who had followed him from Gath were passing by as the king reviewed them 19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite Why should you also go with us Go back and dwell with the new king for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your place 20 Yesterday you came so today should I make you wander with us to go when I must go and where I must go Go back and take your brothers with you and may Jehovah show you loyal love and faithfulness 21 But Ittai answered the king As surely as Jehovah is living and as surely as my lord the king is living wherever my lord the king may be whether for death or for life there your servant will be 22 At that David said to Ittai Go and cross over So Ittai the Gittite crossed over together with all his men and children
23 Everyone in the land was weeping loudly while all these people crossed over and the king was standing by the Kidron Valley all the people were crossing over to the road leading to the wilderness 24 Zadok was also there and with him were all the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of the true God and they set the Ark of the true God down and Abiathar went up while all the people completed crossing over from the city 25 But the king said to Zadok Take the Ark of the true God back to the city If I find favor in the eyes of Jehovah he will also bring me back and let me see it and its dwelling place 26 But if he should say I have found no pleasure in you  then let him do to me whatever seems good in his eyes 27 The king said to Zadok the priest Are you not a seer Return to the city in peace and take the two sons of you men with you Ahimaaz your own son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar 28 See I will linger by the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me 29 So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of the true God back to Jerusalem and they remained there
30 As David was going up the Mount of Olives he was weeping as he went up his head was covered and he was walking barefoot All the people with him also covered their heads and were weeping as they went up 31 David was then told Ahithophel is among those conspiring with Absalom At this David said Turn please the advice of Ahithophel into foolishness O Jehovah
32 When David came to the summit where people used to bow down to God Hushai the Archite was there to meet him with his robe ripped apart and dirt on his head 33 However David said to him If you go across with me you will be a load on me 34 But if you return to the city and you say to Absalom I am your servant O King I was the servant of your father in the past but now I am your servant  you can then frustrate the advice of Ahithophel for me 35 Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you You must tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests everything that you hear from the house of the king 36 Look There with them are their two sons Ahimaaz the son of Zadok and Jonathan the son of Abiathar and through them send to me everything that you hear 37 So Hushai Davids friend went into the city as Absalom was entering into Jerusalem
