1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah learned that the kings heart longed for Absalom 2 So Joab sent to Tekoa and summoned from there a clever woman and told her Act like you are in mourning please and put on garments of mourning and do not rub yourself with oil Behave like a woman who has been mourning over someone dead for a long time 3 Then go in and speak to the king like this With that Joab put the words in her mouth
4 The Tekoite woman went in to the king and fell with her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said Help me O king 5 The king replied to her What is the matter To this she said Alas I am a widow my husband is dead 6 And I your servant had two sons and the two of them fought with each other in the field There was no one to separate them and one struck the other down and killed him 7 Now the whole family has risen up against me your servant and they are saying Hand over the one who struck his brother so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed even if it means wiping out the heir They would extinguish the last glowing coal that I have left and leave to my husband neither a name nor a survivor on the surface of the earth
8 Then the king said to the woman Go to your home and I will issue an order regarding you 9 At this the Tekoite woman said to the king O my lord the king let the guilt be on me and on my fathers house while the king and his throne are innocent 10 The king then said If anyone speaks further to you bring him to me and he will never trouble you again 11 But she said Please let the king remember Jehovah your God so that the avenger of blood does not bring ruin and annihilate my son To this he said As surely as Jehovah is living not one of your sons hairs will fall to the ground 12 The woman now said Let your servant please speak a word to my lord the king So he said Speak
13 The woman said Why then have you thought to do something like this against the people of God When the king speaks this way he makes himself guilty for the king does not bring back his own banished son 14 We will surely die and be like waters that are poured out on the ground which cannot be recovered But God would not take away a life and he considers reasons why the banished one should not always be banished from him 15 I have come in to say this to my lord the king because the people made me afraid So your servant said Let me speak please to the king Perhaps the king will act on the request of his slave 16 The king may listen and rescue his slave from the hand of the man seeking to annihilate me and my only son from the inheritance God gave us 17 Then your servant said May the word of my lord the king please give me relief  for my lord the king is just like an angel of the true God in distinguishing what is good from what is bad May Jehovah your God be with you
18 The king now answered the woman Please do not hide from me anything I ask you The woman replied Let my lord the king speak please 19 The king then asked Did Joab put you up to all of this The woman answered As surely as you are living O my lord the king it is just as my lord the king says for it was your servant Joab who instructed me and put all these words in the mouth of your servant 20 Your servant Joab has done this to change the appearance of things but my lord has wisdom like that of the angel of the true God and knows all that is happening in the land
21 The king then said to Joab All right I will do this thing Go and bring back the young man Absalom 22 At this Joab fell with his face to the ground and prostrated himself and praised the king Joab said Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes O my lord the king because the king has acted on the request of his servant 23 Then Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem 24 However the king said Let him return to his own house but he may not see my face So Absalom returned to his own house and he did not see the face of the king
25 Now in all Israel no man was as highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no flaw in him 26 When he shaved his head—he had to shave it at the end of every year because it was so heavy for him—the hair of his head weighed 200 shekels by the royal stone weight 27 To Absalom were born three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar She was a very beautiful woman
28 And Absalom continued living in Jerusalem for two full years but he did not see the face of the king 29 So Absalom summoned Joab in order to send him to the king but Joab would not come to him Then he sent for him again a second time and he still refused to come 30 Finally he said to his servants Joabs plot of land is next to mine and he has some barley there Go and set it on fire So the servants of Absalom set the plot of land on fire 31 At this Joab got up and came to Absaloms house and said to him Why did your servants set my plot of land on fire 32 Absalom replied to Joab Look I sent this message to you Come and let me send you to the king to ask Why have I come from Geshur It would have been better for me to stay there Now let me see the face of the king and if there is guilt in me then he should put me to death
33 So Joab went in to the king and told him Then he called Absalom who came in to the king and prostrated himself before him falling with his face to the ground before the king Then the king kissed Absalom
