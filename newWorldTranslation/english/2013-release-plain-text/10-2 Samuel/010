1 Later the king of the Ammonites died and his son Hanun became king in his place 2 At that David said I will show loyal love toward Hanun the son of Nahash as his father showed loyal love toward me So David sent his servants to offer him comfort over the loss of his father But when Davids servants came into the land of the Ammonites 3 the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord Do you think that David is honoring your father by sending comforters to you Is it not to search through the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it that David has sent his servants to you 4 So Hanun took the servants of David and shaved off half their beards and cut their garments in half at their buttocks and sent them away 5 When David was told he at once sent men to meet them because the men had been deeply humiliated and the king told them Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back and then return
6 In time the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David so the Ammonites sent and hired Syrians of Beth-rehob and Syrians of Zobah 20000 foot soldiers and the king of Maacah with 1000 men and from Ishtob 12000 men 7 When David heard about it he sent Joab and the entire army including his mightiest warriors 8 And the Ammonites went out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of the city gate while the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob along with Ishtob and Maacah were by themselves in the open field
9 When Joab saw that the battle charges were coming against him from the front and the rear he chose some of the best troops in Israel and drew them up in battle formation to meet the Syrians 10 He put the rest of the men under the command of his brother Abishai in order to draw them up in battle formation to meet the Ammonites 11 Then he said If the Syrians become too strong for me then you must come to my rescue but if the Ammonites become too strong for you I will come to your rescue 12 We must be strong and courageous for our people and for the cities of our God and Jehovah will do what is good in his eyes
13 Then Joab and his men advanced to meet the Syrians in battle and they fled from before him 14 When the Ammonites saw that the Syrians had fled they fled from Abishai and went into the city After that Joab returned from the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem
15 When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel they regrouped 16 So Hadadezer sent for the Syrians in the region of the River and then they came to Helam with Shobach the chief of the army of Hadadezer leading them
17 When the report was made to David he immediately gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam The Syrians then drew up in battle formation to meet David and fought against him 18 But the Syrians fled from Israel and David killed 700 charioteers and 40000 horsemen of the Syrians and he struck down Shobach the chief of their army who died there 19 When all the kings the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel they promptly made peace with Israel and became their subjects and the Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore
