1 At the start of the year at the time when kings go on campaigns David sent Joab and his servants and the entire army of Israel to bring the Ammonites to ruin and they besieged Rabbah while David stayed in Jerusalem
2 One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the rooftop of the kings house From the rooftop he saw a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful 3 David sent someone to inquire about the woman and he reported Is this not Bath-sheba the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite 4 Then David sent messengers to bring her So she came in to him and he lay down with her This happened while she was purifying herself from her uncleanness Afterward she returned to her house
5 The woman became pregnant and she sent a message to David I am pregnant 6 At this David sent a message to Joab Send to me Uriah the Hittite So Joab sent Uriah to David 7 When Uriah came to him David asked him how Joab was getting along how the troops were getting along and how the war was going 8 David then said to Uriah Go down to your house and relax When Uriah left the kings house the kings courtesy gift was sent after him 9 However Uriah slept at the entrance of the kings house with all the other servants of his lord and he did not go down to his own house 10 So David was told Uriah did not go down to his own house At that David said to Uriah Have you not just returned from a journey Why did you not go down to your own house 11 Uriah replied to David The Ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in temporary shelters and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field So should I go into my own house to eat and drink and lie down with my wife As surely as you live and are alive I will not do this thing
12 Then David said to Uriah Stay here also today and tomorrow I will send you away So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem on that day and the following day 13 David then sent for him to come and eat and drink with him and he got him drunk But in the evening he went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his lord and he did not go down to his house 14 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah 15 He wrote in the letter Put Uriah in the front lines where the fighting is fiercest Then retreat from behind him so that he will be struck down and die
16 Joab had been carefully watching the city and he stationed Uriah where he knew there were mighty warriors 17 When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab some of Davids servants fell and Uriah the Hittite was among those who died 18 Joab now reported to David all the news about the war 19 He instructed the messenger When you finish speaking to the king about all the news of the war 20 the king may become angry and say to you Why did you have to go so near to the city to fight Did you not know that they would shoot from the top of the wall 21 Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth Was it not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from the top of the wall causing his death at Thebez Why did you have to go so close to the wall Then say Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died
22 So the messenger went and told David everything that Joab had sent him to tell 23 Then the messenger told David Their men overpowered us and they came out against us in the field but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate 24 And the archers were shooting at your servants from the top of the wall and some of the servants of the king died your servant Uriah the Hittite also died 25 At that David said to the messenger Say this to Joab Do not let this matter trouble you for the sword devours one as well as another Intensify your battle against the city and conquer it And encourage him
26 When Uriahs wife heard that her husband Uriah had died she began to mourn her husband 27 As soon as the mourning period was over David sent for her and brought her to his house and she became his wife and bore him a son But what David had done was very displeasing to Jehovah
