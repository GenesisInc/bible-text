1 These are the last words of David
The word of David the son of Jesse And the word of the man who was raised on high The anointed of the God of Jacob The pleasant singer of the songs of Israel
 2 The spirit of Jehovah spoke through me His word was on my tongue
 3 The God of Israel spoke To me the Rock of Israel said
When the one ruling over mankind is righteous Ruling in the fear of God 4 It is like the morning light when the sun shines A morning without clouds
It is like the brightness after the rain Making grass sprout from the earth
 5 Is not my house like that before God
For he has made an eternal covenant with me Arranged in every detail and secured
Because it means my complete salvation and all my delight Is that not why he makes it flourish
 6 But worthless men are all thrown away like thornbushes For they cannot be taken with the hand
 7 When a man touches them He should be fully armed with iron and the shaft of a spear And they should be completely burned up with fire in their place
8 These are the names of Davids mighty warriors Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite the head of the three He brandished his spear over 800 slain at one time 9 Next to him Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of Ahohi was among the three mighty warriors with David when they taunted the Philistines They had gathered there for the battle and when the men of Israel retreated 10 he stood his ground and kept striking down the Philistines until his arm grew weary and his hand became stiff from gripping the sword So Jehovah brought about a great victory on that day and the people returned behind him to strip the slain
11 Next to him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite The Philistines gathered together at Lehi where there was a plot of land full of lentils and the people fled because of the Philistines 12 But he took his stand in the middle of the field and defended it and kept striking down the Philistines so that Jehovah brought about a great victory
13 Three of the 30 headmen went down during the harvest to David at the cave of Adullam and a company of the Philistines was camped in the Valley of Rephaim 14 David was then in the stronghold and an outpost of the Philistines was in Bethlehem 15 Then David expressed his longing If only I could have a drink of the water from the cistern by the gate of Bethlehem 16 At that the three mighty warriors forced their way into the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the cistern by the gate of Bethlehem and brought it to David but he refused to drink it and poured it out to Jehovah 17 He said It is unthinkable on my part O Jehovah that I should do this Should I drink the blood of the men going at the risk of their lives So he refused to drink it These are the things that his three mighty warriors did
18 Abishai the brother of Joab the son of Zeruiah was the head of another three he brandished his spear over 300 slain and he had a reputation like the three 19 Although he was the most distinguished of the other three and he was their chief he did not attain to the rank of the first three
20 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a courageous man who performed many exploits in Kabzeel He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab and he descended into a waterpit on a snowy day and killed a lion 21 He also struck down an Egyptian man of extraordinary size Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptians hand and killed him with his own spear 22 These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did and he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors 23 Although he was distinguished even more than the thirty he did not attain to the rank of the three However David appointed him over his own bodyguard
24 Asahel the brother of Joab was among the thirty Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem 25 Shammah the Harodite Elika the Harodite 26 Helez the Paltite Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite 27 Abi-ezer the Anathothite Mebunnai the Hushathite 28 Zalmon the Ahohite Maharai the Netophathite 29 Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites 30 Benaiah a Pirathonite Hiddai of the wadis of Gaash 31 Abi-albon the Arbathite Azmaveth the Bar-humite 32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite the sons of Jashen Jonathan 33 Shammah the Hararite Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite 34 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the son of the Maacathite Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite 35 Hezro the Carmelite Paarai the Arbite 36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah Bani the Gadite 37 Zelek the Ammonite Naharai the Beerothite the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah 38 Ira the Ithrite Gareb the Ithrite 39 and Uriah the Hittiteâ€”37 in all
