1 The words of Amos who was among the sheep raisers from Tekoa which he received in vision concerning Israel in the days of King Uzziah of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash the king of Israel two years before the earthquake 2 He said
Jehovah will roar out of Zion And he will raise his voice out of Jerusalem
The pastures of the shepherds will mourn And the summit of Carmel will dry up
 3 This is what Jehovah says For three revolts of Damascus and for four I will not reverse it Because they threshed Gilead with iron threshing sledges
 4 So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazael And it will consume the fortified towers of Ben-hadad
 5 I will break the bars of Damascus I will destroy the inhabitants from Bikath-avenAnd the one ruling from Beth-eden And the people of Syria will go as exiles to Kir  says Jehovah
 6 This is what Jehovah says For three revolts of Gaza and for four I will not reverse it Because they took a whole group of exiles to hand them over to Edom
 7 So I will send a fire onto the wall of Gaza And it will consume her fortified towers
 8 I will destroy the inhabitants from Ashdod And the one ruling from Ashkelon I will turn my hand against Ekron And the remaining Philistines will perish  says the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
 9 This is what Jehovah says For three revolts of Tyre and for four I will not reverse it Because they handed over a whole group of exiles to Edom And because they did not remember the covenant of brothers
10 So I will send a fire onto the wall of Tyre And it will consume her fortified towers
11 This is what Jehovah says For three revolts of Edom and for four I will not reverse it Because he pursued his own brother with the sword And because he refused to show mercy In his anger he keeps tearing them apart relentlessly And he remains furious with them continually
12 So I will send a fire into Teman And it will consume the fortified towers of Bozrah
13 This is what Jehovah says For three revolts of the Ammonites and for four I will not reverse it Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead to widen out their own territory
14 So I will set fire to the wall of Rabbah And it will consume her fortified towers With a war cry in the day of battle With a tempest in the day of storm wind
15 And their king will go into exile together with his princes  says Jehovah
