1 Now as soon as Sanballat Tobiah Geshem the Arabian and the rest of our enemies were told that I had rebuilt the wall and that there were no gaps left in it although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates 2 Sanballat and Geshem immediately sent this message to me Come and let us set a time to meet together in the villages of the Valley Plain of Ono But they were scheming to harm me 3 So I sent messengers to them saying I am engaged in a great work and I am not able to go down Why should the work stop while I leave it to come to you 4 They sent me the same message four times and I gave them the same reply each time
5 Then Sanballat sent his attendant to me with the same message a fifth time with an open letter in his hand 6 There it was written Among the nations it has been heard and Geshem is also saying it that you and the Jews are scheming to rebel That is why you are building the wall and according to these reports you are to become their king 7 Also you have appointed prophets to proclaim about you throughout Jerusalem There is a king in Judah And now these things will be told to the king So come and let us discuss this together
8 However I sent him this reply None of the things you are saying have taken place you are making them up out of your own imagination 9 For they were all trying to frighten us saying Their hands will slacken in the work and it will not be done Now I pray strengthen my hands
10 Then I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel while he was confined there He said Let us set a time to meet at the house of the true God within the temple and let us close the doors of the temple for they are coming to kill you They are coming to kill you by night 11 But I said Should a man like me run away Can a man like me go into the temple and live I will not go in 12 Then I realized that God had not sent him but that Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him to speak this prophecy against me 13 He had been hired to frighten me and to cause me to sin so that they would have grounds to damage my reputation in order to reproach me
14 Do remember O my God Tobiah and Sanballat and these deeds and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were constantly trying to frighten me
15 So the wall was completed on the 25th day of Elul in 52 days
16 As soon as all our enemies heard of it and all the surrounding nations saw it they became greatly ashamed and they realized that it was with our Gods help that this work had been done 17 In those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah and Tobiah would reply to them 18 Many in Judah swore allegiance to him for he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah 19 Also they would constantly tell me good things about him and then report to him what I said Then Tobiah would send letters to frighten me
