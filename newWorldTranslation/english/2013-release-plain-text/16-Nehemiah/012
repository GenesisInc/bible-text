27 At the inauguration of the walls of Jerusalem they sought the Levites and brought them to Jerusalem from all the places they lived to celebrate the inauguration with rejoicing with songs of thanksgiving and with cymbals stringed instruments and harps 28 And the sons of the singers gathered together from the district from all around Jerusalem from the settlements of the Netophathites 29 from Beth-gilgal and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth for the singers had built settlements for themselves all around Jerusalem 30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves and they purified the people the gates and the wall
31 Then I brought the princes of Judah up on top of the wall Further I appointed two large thanksgiving choirs and processions and the one walked to the right on the wall toward the Gate of the Ash Heaps 32 Hoshaiah and half of the princes of Judah walked behind them 33 along with Azariah Ezra Meshullam 34 Judah Benjamin Shemaiah and Jeremiah 35 With them were some of the sons of the priests with the trumpets Zechariah son of Jonathan son of Shemaiah son of Mattaniah son of Micaiah son of Zaccur son of Asaph 36 and his brothers Shemaiah Azarel Milalai Gilalai Maai Nethanel Judah and Hanani with the musical instruments of David the man of the true God and Ezra the copyist went before them 37 At the Fountain Gate they went straight ahead up the Stairway of the City of David by the ascent of the wall above the House of David and on to the Water Gate to the east
38 The other thanksgiving choir walked in the opposite direction and I followed it with half of the people on the wall up over the Tower of the Ovens and on to the Broad Wall 39 and up over the Gate of Ephraim and on to the Gate of the Old City and on to the Fish Gate the Tower of Hananel the Tower of Meah and on to the Sheep Gate and they came to a halt at the Gate of the Guard

44 On that day men were appointed over the storehouses for the contributions the firstfruits and the tenths Into them they were to gather from the fields of the cities the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites for there was rejoicing in Judah because of the priests and the Levites who were ministering 45 And they began taking care of the duties of their God and the obligation of the purification as did the singers and the gatekeepers according to the instructions of David and his son Solomon 46 For long ago in the days of David and Asaph there were directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God 47 And during the days of Zerubbabel and during the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave portions to the singers and the gatekeepers according to the daily need They also set aside the portion for the Levites and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron
