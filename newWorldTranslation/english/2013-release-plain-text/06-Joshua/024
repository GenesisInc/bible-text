1 Joshua then assembled all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem and summoned the elders of Israel its heads its judges and its officers and they stood before the true God 2 Joshua said to all the people This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says It was on the other side of the River that your forefathers lived a long time ago—Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor—and they used to serve other gods
3 In time I took your forefather Abraham from the other side of the River and had him walk through all the land of Canaan and made his offspring many I gave him Isaac 4 then to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau Later to Esau I gave Mount Seir as his possession and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt 5 I later sent Moses and Aaron and I plagued Egypt with what I did among them and then I brought you out 6 When I was bringing your fathers out of Egypt and you came to the sea the Egyptians were chasing after your fathers with war chariots and cavalrymen as far as the Red Sea 7 They began to cry out to Jehovah so he placed a darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea over them and covered them and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt Then you dwelled in the wilderness many years
8 And I brought you to the land of the Amorites who were dwelling on the other side of the Jordan and they fought against you But I gave them into your hand so that you could take possession of their land and I annihilated them from before you 9 Then Balak son of Zippor the king of Moab rose up and fought against Israel So he summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you 10 But I would not listen to Balaam So he blessed you repeatedly and I rescued you from his hand
11 Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho And the leaders of Jericho the Amorites the Perizzites the Canaanites the Hittites the Girgashites the Hivites and the Jebusites fought against you but I gave them into your hand 12 So I sent the feeling of dejection ahead of you and it drove them out from before you—two kings of the Amorites It was not by your sword and not by your bow 13 Thus I gave you a land for which you had not toiled and cities that you had not built and you settled in them You are eating from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant
14 Therefore fear Jehovah and serve him with integrity and faithfulness and remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt and serve Jehovah 15 Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah choose for yourselves today whom you will serve whether the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling But as for me and my household we will serve Jehovah
16 At this the people answered It is unthinkable for us to abandon Jehovah and to serve other gods 17 It is Jehovah our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery and who performed these great signs before our eyes and who kept guarding us the entire way in which we walked and among all the peoples through whom we passed 18 Jehovah drove out all the peoples including the Amorites who lived in the land before us Therefore we too will serve Jehovah because he is our God
19 Then Joshua said to the people You are not able to serve Jehovah for he is a holy God he is a God who requires exclusive devotion He will not pardon your transgressions and your sins 20 If you abandon Jehovah and serve foreign gods he will also turn against you and exterminate you after doing good for you
21 But the people said to Joshua No but we will serve Jehovah 22 So Joshua said to the people You are witnesses against yourselves that of your own accord you have chosen for yourselves to serve Jehovah To this they said We are witnesses
23 Therefore remove the foreign gods that are among you and incline your hearts to Jehovah the God of Israel 24 The people said to Joshua We will serve Jehovah our God and we will obey his voice
25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day and established a regulation and a ruling for them in Shechem 26 Then Joshua wrote these words in the book of Gods Law and took a great stone and set it up under the large tree that is by the sanctuary of Jehovah
27 Joshua went on to say to all the people Look This stone will serve as a witness against us because it has heard everything Jehovah said to us and it will serve as a witness against you so that you may not deny your God 28 With that Joshua sent the people away each one to his inheritance
29 After these things Joshua the son of Nun the servant of Jehovah died at the age of 110 30 So they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah which is in the mountainous region of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash 31 Israel continued to serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had known all of Jehovahs deeds in behalf of Israel
32 The bones of Joseph which the Israelites had brought up out of Egypt were buried in Shechem in the portion of the field that Jacob had acquired from the sons of Hamor Shechems father for 100 pieces of money and it became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph
33 Also Eleazar the son of Aaron died So they buried him in the Hill of Phinehas his son which had been given to him in the mountainous region of Ephraim
