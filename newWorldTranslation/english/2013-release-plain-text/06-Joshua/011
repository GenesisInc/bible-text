1 As soon as Jabin king of Hazor heard of it he sent word to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of Shimron the king of Achshaph 2 the kings who were in the northern mountainous region those in the plains south of Chinnereth those in the Shephelah and on the slopes of Dor to the west 3 the Canaanites to the east and the west the Amorites the Hittites the Perizzites the Jebusites in the mountainous region and the Hivites at the base of Hermon in the land of Mizpah 4 So they came out with all their armies a vast multitude as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore together with very many horses and war chariots 5 All these kings agreed to meet and they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel
6 At this Jehovah said to Joshua Do not be afraid because of them for about this time tomorrow I am giving over all of them slain to Israel Their horses you must hamstring and their chariots you must burn in the fire 7 Joshua together with all the fighting men then launched a surprise attack against them along the waters of Merom 8 Jehovah gave them into Israels hand and they defeated them and pursued them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the Valley of Mizpeh to the east and they struck them down until no survivors remained 9 Joshua then did to them just as Jehovah had told him he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots in the fire
10 Moreover Joshua then returned and captured Hazor and struck down its king with the sword because Hazor had formerly been the head of all these kingdoms 11 They struck down everyone in it with the sword devoting them to destruction Not a breathing thing was left Then he burned Hazor in the fire 12 Joshua captured all the cities of these kings and defeated all their kings with the sword He devoted them to destruction just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded 13 However Israel did not burn any of the cities that stood on their mounds except Hazor it was the only one Joshua burned 14 All the spoil of these cities and the livestock the Israelites plundered for themselves But they struck every human with the sword until they had annihilated each one They did not let anyone who breathed remain 15 Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses his servant so Moses commanded Joshua and so Joshua did He left nothing undone of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses
16 Joshua conquered all this land the mountainous region all the Negeb all the land of Goshen the Shephelah the Arabah and the mountainous region of Israel and its Shephelah 17 from Mount Halak which goes up to Seir and as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the base of Mount Hermon and he captured all their kings and defeated them putting them to death 18 Joshua waged war with all these kings for quite some time 19 There was no city that made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites inhabiting Gibeon They conquered all the others by war 20 It was Jehovah who allowed their hearts to become stubborn so that they waged war against Israel in order for him to devote them to destruction without any favorable consideration They were to be annihilated just as Jehovah had commanded Moses
21 At that time Joshua wiped out the Anakim from the mountainous region from Hebron Debir Anab and all the mountainous region of Judah and all the mountainous region of Israel Joshua devoted them and their cities to destruction 22 There were no Anakim left in the land of the Israelites they remained only in Gaza in Gath and in Ashdod 23 So Joshua took control of all the land just as Jehovah had promised Moses and then Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel by their shares to be divided among their tribes And the land had rest from war
