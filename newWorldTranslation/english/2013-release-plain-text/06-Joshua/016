1 And the land that fell by lot to the descendants of Joseph was from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters east of Jericho through the wilderness going up from Jericho into the mountainous region of Bethel 2 It extended from Bethel belonging to Luz and continued to the boundary of the Archites at Ataroth 3 then it went down westward to the boundary of the Japhletites as far as the boundary of Lower Beth-horon and Gezer and it ended at the sea
4 So Josephs descendants Manasseh and Ephraim took possession of their land 5 The boundary of the descendants of Ephraim by their families was as follows The boundary of their inheritance to the east was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon 6 and the boundary extended to the sea Michmethath was on the north and the boundary went around east to Taanath-shiloh and it passed on the east to Janoah 7 Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah and reached to Jericho and extended to the Jordan 8 From Tappuah the boundary continued westward to the Wadi of Kanah and it ended at the sea This is the inheritance of the tribe of Ephraim by their families 9 the descendants of Ephraim also had enclave cities in the midst of the inheritance of Manasseh all the cities and their settlements
10 But they did not drive away the Canaanites who were dwelling in Gezer and the Canaanites continue to dwell among Ephraim to this day and have been subjected to forced labor
