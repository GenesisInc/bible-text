1 The heads of the paternal houses of the Levites now approached Eleazar the priest Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel 2 and they spoke to them in Shiloh in the land of Canaan saying Jehovah through Moses commanded that we be given cities in which to dwell along with their pastures for our livestock 3 So at the order of Jehovah the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pastures out of their own inheritance
4 The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites and the Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were given by lot 13 cities out of the tribe of Judah the tribe of Simeon and the tribe of Benjamin

7 For the Merarites by their families there were 12 cities out of the tribe of Reuben the tribe of Gad and the tribe of Zebulun
8 Thus the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pastures by lot just as Jehovah had commanded through Moses

41 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the Israelites were 48 cities together with their pastures 42 Each of these cities had its pastures all around it—this was the case for all these cities
43 So Jehovah gave Israel all the land that he had sworn to give to their forefathers and they took possession of it and settled in it 44 Furthermore Jehovah gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their forefathers and not one of all their enemies could stand against them Jehovah gave all their enemies into their hand 45 Not a promise failed out of all the good promises that Jehovah had made to the house of Israel all of them came true
