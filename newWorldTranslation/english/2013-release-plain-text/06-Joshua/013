1 Now Joshua had grown old and was advanced in years So Jehovah said to him You have grown old and are advanced in years but much of the land remains to be taken in possession 2 This is the land remaining all the regions of the Philistines and all the Geshurites 3 from the branch of the Nile that is east of Egypt up to the border of Ekron to the north which used to be considered Canaanite territory including that of the five lords of the Philistinesâ€”the Gazites the Ashdodites the Ashkelonites the Gittites and the Ekronites that of the Avvim 4 to the south all the land of the Canaanites Mearah which belongs to the Sidonians as far as Aphek to the border of the Amorites 5 the land of the Gebalites and all of Lebanon toward the east from Baal-gad at the base of Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath 6 all the inhabitants of the mountainous region from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim and all the Sidonians I will drive them out before the Israelites You have only to assign it to Israel as an inheritance just as I have commanded you 7 Now you must apportion this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh
8 With the other half tribe the Reubenites and the Gadites took their inheritance that Moses gave them on the east side of the Jordan just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had given them 9 from Aroer which is on the rim of the Arnon Valley and the city that is in the middle of the valley and all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon 10 and all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon up to the border of the Ammonites 11 also Gilead and the territory of the Geshurites and the Maacathites and all Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as Salecah 12 all the royal realm of Og in Bashan who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei He was one of the last of the Rephaim Moses defeated them and drove them out 13 But the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites and the Maacathites for Geshur and Maacath live in the midst of Israel to this day
14 It was only to the tribe of the Levites that he did not give an inheritance The offerings made by fire to Jehovah the God of Israel are their inheritance just as he promised them
15 Then Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the Reubenites by their families 16 and their territory was from Aroer which is on the rim of the Arnon Valley and the city in the middle of the valley and all the tableland by Medeba 17 Heshbon and all its towns on the tableland Dibon Bamoth-baal Beth-baal-meon 18 Jahaz Kedemoth Mephaath 19 Kiriathaim Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the mountain of the valley 20 Beth-peor the slopes of Pisgah Beth-jeshimoth 21 all the cities of the tableland and all the royal realm of King Sihon of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon Moses defeated him and the Midianite chieftains Evi Rekem Zur Hur and Reba vassals of Sihon who were dwelling in the land 22 Balaam the son of Beor the diviner was one whom the Israelites killed with the sword along with the rest who were slain 23 The boundary of the Reubenites was the Jordan and this territory was the inheritance of the Reubenites by their families with the cities and their settlements
24 Furthermore Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad the Gadites by their families 25 and their territory included Jazer and all the cities of Gilead and half of the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer which faces Rabbah 26 and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir 27 and in the valley Beth-haram Beth-nimrah Succoth and Zaphon the rest of the royal realm of King Sihon of Heshbon with the Jordan as the border from the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth on the east side of the Jordan 28 This was the inheritance of the Gadites by their families with the cities and their settlements
29 Further Moses gave an inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh to half of the tribe of Manasseh by their families 30 And their territory extended from Mahanaim and took in all of Bashan all the royal realm of King Og of Bashan and all the tent villages of Jair in Bashan 60 towns 31 And half of Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei the cities of the royal realm of Og in Bashan went to the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh to half of the sons of Machir by their families
32 These were the inheritances that Moses gave them on the desert plains of Moab beyond the Jordan east of Jericho
33 But to the tribe of the Levites Moses did not give an inheritance Jehovah the God of Israel is their inheritance just as he promised them
