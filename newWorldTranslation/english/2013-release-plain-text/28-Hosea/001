1 The word of Jehovah that came to Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash the king of Israel 2 When Jehovah started to speak his word through Hosea Jehovah said to Hosea Go marry a woman of prostitution and have children of prostitution because by prostitution the land has turned completely away from following Jehovah
3 So he went and married Gomer the daughter of Diblaim and she conceived and bore him a son
4 Then Jehovah said to him Name him Jezreel for in a little while I will hold an accounting against the house of Jehu for the acts of bloodshed of Jezreel and I will put an end to the royal rule of the house of Israel 5 In that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel
6 She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter And He told him Name her Lo-ruhamah for I will no longer show mercy to the house of Israel because I will certainly drive them away 7 But I will show mercy to the house of Judah and I will save them by Jehovah their God I will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen
8 After weaning Lo-ruhamah she conceived and gave birth to a son 9 Then He said Name him Lo-ammi because you are not my people and I will not be yours
10 And the number of the people of Israel will be like the grains of sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered And in the place where it was said to them You are not my people  it will be said to them The sons of the living God 11 And the people of Judah and of Israel will be gathered together into unity and will choose for themselves one head and go up out of the land for great will be the day of Jezreel
