1 When Israel was a boy I loved him And out of Egypt I called my son
 2 The more they called them The more they went away from them
They kept sacrificing to the Baal imagesAnd offering sacrifices to the graven images
 3 But it was I who taught Ephraim to walk taking them in my arms And they did not acknowledge that I had healed them
 4 With the ropes of men I kept drawing them with the cords of love And I was to them like one lifting a yoke from their jaws And I gently brought food to each one
 5 They will not return to the land of Egypt but Assyria will be their king Because they refused to return to me
 6 And a sword will whirl against his citiesAnd destroy his bars and devour them because of their schemes
 7 My people are bent on unfaithfulness to me
Though they called them upward no one rises up
 8 How can I give you up O Ephraim
How can I hand you over O Israel
How can I treat you like Admah
How can I make you like Zeboiim
I have had a change of heart At the same time my compassions are stirred
 9 I will not vent my burning anger
I will not destroy Ephraim again For I am God and not man The Holy One in your midst And I will not come against you in fury
10 They will walk after Jehovah and he will roar like a lion When he roars his sons will come trembling from the west
11 They will tremble like a bird when they come out of Egypt Like a dove out of the land of Assyria And I will settle them in their houses  declares Jehovah
12 Ephraim has surrounded me with lies And the house of Israel with deceit
But Judah still roams with God And he is faithful to the Most Holy One
