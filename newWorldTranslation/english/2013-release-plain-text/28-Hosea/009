1 Do not rejoice O Israel Do not act joyfully like the peoples
For by prostitution you have strayed from your God
You have loved the wages of a prostitute on every threshing floor of grain
 2 But the threshing floor and winepress will not feed them And new wine will fail her
 3 They will not continue dwelling in the land of Jehovah Instead Ephraim will return to Egypt And in Assyria they will eat what is unclean
 4 They will no longer pour out wine offerings to Jehovah Their sacrifices will not please him
They are like the bread of mourning All those eating it will defile themselves
For their bread is for themselves alone It will not come into the house of Jehovah
 5 What will you do in the day of meeting In the day of Jehovahs festival
 6 For look they will have to flee because of destruction
Egypt will gather them together and Memphis will bury them
Nettles will take possession of their precious things of silver And thornbushes will be in their tents
 7 The days of reckoning will come The days of retribution will come And Israel will know it
Their prophet will be a fool and the man of inspiration will go mad Because your error is abundant the animosity against you is abundant
 8 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God
But now all the ways of his prophets are as the traps of a birdcatcher There is animosity in the house of his God
 9 They have sunk deep into ruin as in the days of Gibeah
He will remember their error and punish their sins
10 Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel
Like the first of the early figs on a fig tree I saw your forefathers
But they went to Baal of Peor They dedicated themselves to the shameful thing And they became disgusting like the object of their love
11 Ephraims glory flies away like a bird There is no giving birth no pregnancy and no conception
12 Even if they raise children I will bereave them until no man is left Yes woe to them when I turn away from them
13 Ephraim planted in a pasture was to me like Tyre Now Ephraim must bring his sons out to the slaughter
14 Give them O Jehovah what you should give them A womb that miscarries and dry breasts
15 All their wickedness was in Gilgal for there I came to hate them
I will drive them away from my house because of their evil deeds
I will no longer love them All their princes are stubborn
16 Ephraim will be struck down
Their root will dry up and they will produce no fruit
Even if they give birth I will put to death their cherished offspring
17 My God will reject them For they have not listened to him And they will become fugitives among the nations
