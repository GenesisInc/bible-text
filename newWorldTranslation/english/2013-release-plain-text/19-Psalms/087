Of the sons of Korah A melody A song
87 His citys foundation is in the holy mountains
 2 Jehovah loves the gates of ZionMore than all the tents of Jacob
 3 Glorious things are being said about you O city of the true God Selah
 4 I will count Rahab and Babylon among those who know me Here are Philistia and Tyre together with Cush
It will be said This is one who was born there
 5 And about Zion it will be said
Each and every one was born in her
And the Most High will firmly establish her
 6 Jehovah will declare when recording the peoples
This is one who was born there Selah
 7 Singers and those performing circle dances will say
All my springs are in you
