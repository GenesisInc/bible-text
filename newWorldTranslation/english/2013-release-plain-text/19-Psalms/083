A song A melody of Asaph
83 O God do not be silent Do not keep quiet or still O Divine One
 2 For look your enemies are in an uproar Those who hate you act arrogantly
 3 With cunning they secretly plot against your people They conspire against your treasured ones
 4 They say Come let us annihilate them as a nation So that the name of Israel may be remembered no more
 5 They devise a unified strategy They have made an alliance against youâ€” 6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites Moab and the Hagrites 7 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek Philistia together with the inhabitants of Tyre
 8 Assyria too has joined them They give support to the sons of Lot Selah
 9 Do to them as you did to Midian As you did to Sisera and Jabin at the stream of Kishon
10 They were annihilated at En-dor They became manure for the ground
11 Make their nobles like Oreb and ZeebAnd their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna 12 For they said Let us take possession of the land where God dwells
13 O my God make them like a whirling thistle Like stubble blown about by the wind
14 Like a fire that burns up the forest Like a flame that scorches the mountains 15 So may you pursue them with your tempestAnd terrify them with your windstorm
16 Cover their faces with dishonor So that they may search for your name O Jehovah
17 May they be put to shame and be terrified forever May they be disgraced and perish 18 May people know that you whose name is Jehovah You alone are the Most High over all the earth
