A song A melody of David
108 My heart is steadfast O God
I will sing and make music with my whole being
 2 Do awake O stringed instrument you too O harp
I will awaken the dawn
 3 I will praise you among the peoples O Jehovah And I will sing praises to you among the nations
 4 For your loyal love is great as high as the heavens And your faithfulness up to the skies
 5 Be exalted above the heavens O God May your glory be over all the earth
 6 So that your loved ones may be rescued Save us with your right hand and answer me
 7 God has spoken in his holiness
I will exult I will give out Shechem as an inheritance And I will measure off the Valley of Succoth
 8 Gilead belongs to me as does Manasseh And Ephraim is the helmet for my head Judah is my commanders staff
 9 Moab is my washbasin
Over Edom I will throw my sandal
Over Philistia I will shout in triumph
10 Who will bring me to the fortified city
Who will lead me as far as Edom
11 Is it not you O God who have rejected us Our God who no longer goes out with our armies
12 Help us in our distress For salvation by humans is worthless
13 By God we will gain power And he will trample on our adversaries
