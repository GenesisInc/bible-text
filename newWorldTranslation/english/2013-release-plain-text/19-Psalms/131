A Song of the Ascents Of David
131 O Jehovah my heart is not haughty Nor are my eyes lofty Nor do I aspire to things too great Or to things that are beyond me
 2 No but I have calmed and quieted my soulLike a weaned child with its mother I am contented like a weaned child
 3 Let Israel wait for JehovahFrom now on and forever
