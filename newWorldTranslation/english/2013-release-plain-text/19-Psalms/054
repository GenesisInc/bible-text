To the director to be accompanied with stringed instruments Maskil Of David when the Ziphites came in and said to Saul David is hiding among us
54 O God save me by your name And defend me with your power
 2 O God hear my prayer Pay attention to the words of my mouth
 3 For strangers rise up against me And ruthless men seek my life
They have no regard for God Selah
 4 Look God is my helper Jehovah is with those supporting me
 5 He will repay my foes with their own evil In your faithfulness put an end to them
 6 I will sacrifice to you willingly
I will praise your name O Jehovah for it is good
 7 For he saves me from every distress And I will look in triumph on my enemies
