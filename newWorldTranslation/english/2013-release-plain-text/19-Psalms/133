A Song of the Ascents Of David
133 Look How good and how pleasant it isFor brothers to dwell together in unity
 2 It is like fine oil poured on the headThat runs down the beard Aarons beard And runs down onto the collar of his garments
 3 It is like the dew of HermonThat descends on the mountains of Zion
That is where Jehovah decreed his blessingâ€”Life everlasting
