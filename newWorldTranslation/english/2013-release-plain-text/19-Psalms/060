To the director set to The Lily of Reminder Miktam Of David For teaching When he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-Zobah and Joab returned and struck down 12000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt
60 O God you rejected us you broke through our defenses
You were angry with us but now accept us back
 2 You caused the earth to quake you split it open
Repair its breaches for it is falling
 3 You caused your people to suffer hardship
You made us drink wine that makes us stagger
 4 Give a signal to those fearing youTo flee and dodge the bow Selah
 5 So that your loved ones may be rescued Save us with your right hand and answer us
 6 God has spoken in his holiness
I will exult I will give out Shechem as an inheritance And I will measure off the Valley of Succoth
 7 Gilead belongs to me as does Manasseh And Ephraim is the helmet for my head Judah is my commanders staff
 8 Moab is my washbasin
Over Edom I will throw my sandal
Over Philistia I will shout in triumph
 9 Who will bring me to the besieged city
Who will lead me as far as Edom
10 Is it not you O God who have rejected us Our God who no longer goes out with our armies
11 Help us in our distress For salvation by humans is worthless
12 By God we will gain power And he will trample on our adversaries
