1 After these things the chief cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the chief baker sinned against their lord the king of Egypt 2 So Pharaoh grew indignant at his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief baker 3 and he committed them to the jail of the house of the chief of the guard to the place where Joseph was a prisoner 4 Then the chief of the guard assigned Joseph to be with them and to take care of them and they remained in jail for some time
5 The cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt who were confined in the prison each had a dream on the same night and each dream had its own interpretation 6 The next morning when Joseph came in and saw them they looked dejected 7 So he asked the officers of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his masters house Why are your faces gloomy today 8 At this they said to him We each had a dream but there is no interpreter with us Joseph said to them Do not interpretations belong to God Relate it to me please
9 So the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph saying to him In my dream there was a vine before me 10 And on the vine there were three twigs and as it was sprouting shoots it blossomed and its clusters ripened into grapes 11 And Pharaohs cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and squeezed them out into Pharaohs cup After that I put the cup in Pharaohs hand 12 Then Joseph said to him This is its interpretation The three twigs are three days 13 Three days from now Pharaoh will bring you out restoring you to your office and you will put Pharaohs cup into his hand as you did before when you were his cupbearer 14 Nevertheless you must remember me when things go well with you Please show me loyal love and mention me to Pharaoh in order to get me out of this place 15 I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews and I have not done anything here for which they should put me in prison
16 When the chief baker saw that Joseph had interpreted something good he said to him I too was in my dream and there were three baskets of white bread on my head 17 and in the top basket there were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh and there were birds eating them out of the basket on top of my head 18 Then Joseph answered This is its interpretation The three baskets are three days 19 Three days from now Pharaoh will behead you and will hang you on a stake and the birds will eat your flesh from you
20 Now the third day was Pharaohs birthday and he made a feast for all his servants and he brought out both the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his servants 21 And he returned the chief cupbearer to his post of cupbearer and he continued to hand the cup to Pharaoh 22 But he hanged the chief baker just as Joseph had interpreted to them 23 However the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph he kept forgetting him
