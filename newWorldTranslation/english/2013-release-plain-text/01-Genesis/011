1 Now all the earth continued to be of one language and of one set of words 2 As they traveled eastward they discovered a valley plain in the land of Shinar and they began dwelling there 3 Then they said to one another Come Let us make bricks and bake them with fire So they used bricks instead of stone and bitumen as mortar 4 They now said Come Let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves so that we will not be scattered over the entire face of the earth
5 Then Jehovah went down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built 6 Jehovah then said Look They are one people with one language and this is what they have started to do Now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be impossible for them 7 Come Let us go down there and confuse their language in order that they may not understand one anothers language 8 So Jehovah scattered them from there over the entire face of the earth and they gradually left off building the city 9 That is why it was named Babel because there Jehovah confused the language of all the earth and Jehovah scattered them from there over the entire face of the earth
