1 About that time Judah left his brothers and pitched his tent near an Adullamite man named Hirah 2 There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite named Shua So he took her and had relations with her 3 and she became pregnant Later she bore a son and he named him Er 4 Again she became pregnant and bore a son and named him Onan 5 Yet again she bore a son and named him Shelah He was in Achzib when she bore him
6 In time Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn and her name was Tamar 7 But Er Judahs firstborn was displeasing to Jehovah so Jehovah put him to death 8 In view of that Judah said to Onan Have relations with your brothers wife and perform brother-in-law marriage with her and raise up offspring for your brother 9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be considered his So when he did have relations with his brothers wife he wasted his semen on the ground so as not to give offspring to his brother 10 What he did was bad in the eyes of Jehovah so he also put him to death 11 Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law Dwell as a widow in the house of your father until my son Shelah grows up  for he said to himself He too may die like his brothers So Tamar went and stayed in her own fathers house
12 Some time passed and Judahs wife the daughter of Shua died Judah kept the mourning period and then he went to his sheepshearers in Timnah with his companion Hirah the Adullamite 13 Tamar was told Here your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep 14 With that she removed her widows clothing and veiled herself and covered herself with a shawl and sat down at the entrance of Enaim which is on the road to Timnah for she saw that Shelah had grown up and yet she had not been given to him as a wife
15 When Judah caught sight of her he at once took her for a prostitute because she had covered her face 16 So he turned aside to her by the road and said Allow me please to have relations with you  for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law However she said What will you give me that you may have relations with me 17 To this he said I will send a young goat from my herd But she said Will you give a security until you send it 18 He continued What security should I give you to which she said Your seal ring and your cord and your rod that is in your hand Then he gave them to her and had relations with her and she became pregnant by him 19 After that she got up and went away and removed her shawl and clothed herself with her widows clothing
20 And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his companion the Adullamite to get back the security from the hand of the woman but he never found her 21 He inquired of the men of her place saying Where is that temple prostitute in Enaim along the road But they said No temple prostitute has ever been in this place 22 Finally he returned to Judah and said I never found her and besides the men of the place said No temple prostitute has ever been in this place 23 So Judah said Let her take them for herself in order that we may not fall into contempt At any rate I have sent this young goat but you never found her
24 However about three months later Judah was told Tamar your daughter-in-law has acted as a prostitute and she is also pregnant by her prostitution At that Judah said Bring her out and let her be burned 25 As she was being brought out she sent word to her father-in-law I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong Then she added Please examine to whom these belong the seal ring and the cord and the rod 26 Then Judah examined them and said She is more righteous than I am because I did not give her to Shelah my son And he had no further sexual relations with her after that
27 When the time came for her to give birth there were twins in her womb 28 As she was giving birth one put out his hand and the midwife immediately took a scarlet thread and tied it around his hand saying This one came out first 29 But as soon as he drew back his hand his brother came out and she exclaimed What a breach you have made for yourself So he was named Perez 30 Afterward his brother came out around whose hand the scarlet thread was tied and he was named Zerah
