1 After these things Joseph was told Look your father is getting weak At that he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him 2 Then Jacob was told Here your son Joseph has come to you So Israel gathered his strength and sat up on his bed 3 And Jacob said to Joseph
God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me 4 And he said to me I am making you fruitful and I will make you many and I will transform you into a congregation of peoples and I will give this land to your offspring after you as a lasting possession 5 Now your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt are mine Ephraim and Manasseh will become mine just as Reuben and Simeon are mine 6 But the children born to you after them will become yours They will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance 7 As for me when I was coming from Paddan Rachel died alongside me in the land of Canaan while there was yet a good stretch of land before coming to Ephrath So I buried her there on the way to Ephrath that is Bethlehem
8 Then Israel saw Josephs sons and asked Who are these 9 So Joseph said to his father They are my sons whom God has given me in this place At this he said Bring them to me please so that I may bless them 10 Now the eyes of Israel were failing from age and he was unable to see So Joseph brought them close to him and he kissed them and embraced them 11 Israel said to Joseph I never imagined I would see your face but here God has also let me see your offspring 12 Joseph then removed them from Israels knees and he bowed down with his face to the ground
13 Joseph now took the two of them Ephraim with his right hand to Israels left and Manasseh with his left hand to Israels right and brought them close to him 14 However Israel put out his right hand and placed it on Ephraims head although he was the younger and he placed his left hand on Manassehs head He purposely laid his hands this way since Manasseh was the firstborn 15 Then he blessed Joseph and said
The true God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked The true God who has been shepherding me during all my life until this day 16 The angel who has been recovering me from all calamity bless the boys
Let my name be called upon them and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac Let them increase to a multitude in the earth
17 When Joseph saw that his father kept his right hand placed on Ephraims head it was displeasing to him so he tried to take hold of his fathers hand to move it from Ephraims head to Manassehs head 18 Joseph said to his father Not so my father because this is the firstborn Put your right hand on his head 19 But his father kept refusing and said I know it my son I know it He too will become a people and he too will become great Nevertheless his younger brother will become greater than he will and his offspring will become the full equivalent of nations 20 So he continued to bless them on that day saying
Let Israel mention you when they pronounce blessings saying May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh
Thus he kept putting Ephraim before Manasseh
21 Then Israel said to Joseph Look I am dying but God will certainly continue with you and return you to the land of your forefathers 22 As for me I do give you one portion of land more than to your brothers which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and my bow
