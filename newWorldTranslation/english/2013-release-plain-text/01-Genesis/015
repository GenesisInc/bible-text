1 After this the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision saying Do not fear Abram I am a shield for you Your reward will be very great 2 Abram replied Sovereign Lord Jehovah what will you give me seeing that I continue childless and the one who will inherit my house is a man of Damascus Eliezer 3 Abram added You have given me no offspring and a member of my household is succeeding me as heir 4 But look Jehovahs word in reply to him was This man will not succeed you as heir but your own son will succeed you as heir
5 He now brought him outside and said Look up please to the heavens and count the stars if you are able to do so Then he said to him So your offspring will become 6 And he put faith in Jehovah and He counted it to him as righteousness 7 Then he added I am Jehovah who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land as your possession 8 To this he said Sovereign Lord Jehovah how will I know that I will take possession of it 9 He replied to him Take for me a three-year-old heifer a three-year-old female goat a three-year-old ram a turtledove and a young pigeon 10 So he took all of these and cut them in two and put each part opposite the other but he did not cut up the birds 11 Then the birds of prey began to descend on the carcasses but Abram kept driving them away
12 When the sun was about to set a deep sleep fell upon Abram and a great and frightening darkness descended on him 13 Then He said to Abram Know for certain that your offspring will be foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people there will enslave them and afflict them for 400 years 14 But I will judge the nation they will serve and after that they will go out with many goods 15 As for you you will go to your forefathers in peace you will be buried at a good old age 16 But they will return here in the fourth generation because the error of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure
17 When the sun had set and it had become very dark a smoking furnace appeared and a fiery torch passed between the pieces 18 On that day Jehovah made with Abram a covenant saying To your offspring I will give this land from the river of Egypt to the great river the river Euphrates 19 the land of the Kenites the Kenizzites the Kadmonites 20 the Hittites the Perizzites the Rephaim 21 the Amorites the Canaanites the Girgashites and the Jebusites
