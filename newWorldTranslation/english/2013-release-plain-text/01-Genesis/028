1 So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him saying You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan 2 Go away to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel your mothers father and from there take for yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban your mothers brother 3 God Almighty will bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you and you will certainly become a congregation of peoples 4 And he will give to you the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you so that you may take possession of the land where you have been living as a foreigner which God has given to Abraham
5 So Isaac sent Jacob away and he departed for Paddan-aram to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramaean the brother of Rebekah the mother of Jacob and Esau
6 Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there and that when he blessed him he commanded him Do not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan  7 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and departed for Paddan-aram 8 Esau then realized that the daughters of Canaan were displeasing to his father Isaac 9 so Esau went to Ishmael and took as wife Mahalath the daughter of Abrahams son Ishmael the sister of Nebaioth in addition to the other wives he already had
10 Jacob departed from Beer-sheba and kept going toward Haran 11 In time he came to a place and prepared to spend the night there because the sun had set So he took one of the stones of that place and set it to rest his head on and lay down there 12 Then he had a dream and look there was a stairway set on the earth and its top reached up to the heavens and there were Gods angels ascending and descending on it 13 And look there was Jehovah stationed above it and he said
I am Jehovah the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac The land on which you are lying to you I am going to give it and to your offspring 14 And your offspring will certainly become like the dust particles of the earth and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and by means of you and by means of your offspring all the families of the ground will certainly be blessed 15 I am with you and I will safeguard you wherever you go and I will return you to this land I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you
16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said Truly Jehovah is in this place and I did not know it 17 And he grew fearful and added How awe-inspiring this place is This can only be the house of God and this is the gate of the heavens 18 So Jacob got up early in the morning and took the stone on which he had rested his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it 19 So he named that place Bethel but previously the citys name was Luz
20 Jacob then made a vow saying If God will continue with me and will protect me on my journey and will give me bread to eat and garments to wear 21 and I return in peace to the house of my father then Jehovah will certainly have proved to be my God 22 And this stone that I have set up as a pillar will become a house of God and without fail I will give you a tenth of everything you give to me
