1 Now in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar Arioch king of Ellasar Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim 2 these made war with Bera king of Sodom Birsha king of Gomorrah Shinab king of Admah Shemeber king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela that is Zoar 3 All of these joined forces at the Valley of Siddim that is the Salt Sea
4 They had served Chedorlaomer for 12 years but they rebelled in the 13th year 5 So in the 14th year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim the Zuzim in Ham the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim 6 and the Horites in their mountain of Seir down to El-paran which is at the wilderness 7 Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat that is Kadesh and conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar
8 At this point the king of Sodom went on the march and also the king of Gomorrah the king of Admah the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela that is Zoar and they drew up in battle formation against them in the Valley of Siddim 9 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam Tidal king of Goiim Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against the five 10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah tried to escape and fell into them and those who remained fled to the mountainous region 11 Then the victors took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food and went on their way 12 They also took Lot the son of Abrams brother who was dwelling in Sodom as well as his goods and they continued on their way
13 After that a man who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew He was then dwelling among the big trees of Mamre the Amorite the brother of Eshcol and Aner These men were allies of Abram 14 Thus Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive With that he mobilized his trained men 318 servants born in his household and went in pursuit up to Dan 15 During the night he divided his forces and he and his servants attacked and defeated them And he pursued them up to Hobah which is north of Damascus 16 He recovered all the goods and he also recovered Lot his relative his goods the women and the other people
17 After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him the king of Sodom went out to meet Abram at the Valley of Shaveh that is the Valley of the King 18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine he was priest of the Most High God
19 Then he blessed him and said
Blessed be Abram by the Most High God Maker of heaven and earth 20 And praised be the Most High God Who has handed your oppressors over to you
And Abram gave him a tenth of everything
21 After that the king of Sodom said to Abram Give me the people but take the goods for yourself 22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom I raise my hand in an oath to Jehovah the Most High God Maker of heaven and earth 23 that I will not take anything that is yours from a thread to a sandal lace so that you may not say I made Abram rich 24 I will take nothing except what the young men have already eaten As for the share of the men who went with me Aner Eshcol and Mamre—let them take their share
