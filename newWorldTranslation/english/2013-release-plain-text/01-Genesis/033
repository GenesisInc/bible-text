1 Now Jacob raised his eyes and saw Esau coming and 400 men were with him So he divided the children among Leah Rachel and the two female servants 2 He put the female servants and their children in front Leah and her children after them and Rachel and Joseph behind them 3 Then he himself went ahead of them and bowed down to the earth seven times as he came near to his brother
4 But Esau ran to meet him and he embraced him and kissed him and they burst into tears 5 When he raised his eyes and saw the women and the children he said Who are these with you to which he said The children with whom God has favored your servant 6 At that the female servants came forward with their children and bowed down 7 and Leah too came forward with her children and they bowed down Then Joseph came forward with Rachel and they bowed down
8 Esau said What is the purpose of all this camp of travelers that I have met He replied In order to find favor in the eyes of my lord 9 Then Esau said I have a great many possessions my brother Keep what is yours 10 However Jacob said No please If I have found favor in your eyes you must take my gift from my hand because I brought it so that I could see your face And I have seen your face as though seeing Gods face in that you received me with pleasure 11 Take please the gift conveying my blessing that was brought to you for God has favored me and I have everything I need And he continued to urge him so that he took it
12 Later Esau said Let us move out and go and let me go in advance of you 13 But he said to him My lord is aware that the children are delicate and that in my care are sheep and cattle nursing their young If they are driven too quickly for one day then the whole flock will die 14 Let my lord please go on ahead of his servant but I will continue the journey more slowly at the pace of my livestock and of the children until I come to my lord at Seir 15 Then Esau said Please let me leave some of my people with you To this he said Why do this Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord 16 So that day Esau went on his way back to Seir
17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and he built a house for himself and he made shelters for his herd That was why he named the place Succoth
18 After journeying from Paddan-aram Jacob arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan and he set up his camp near the city 19 Then he acquired a portion of the field where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for 100 pieces of money 20 There he set up an altar and called it God the God of Israel
