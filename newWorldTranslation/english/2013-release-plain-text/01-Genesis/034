1 Now Dinah Jacobs daughter by Leah used to go out to spend time with the young women of the land 2 When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite a chieftain of the land saw her he took her and lay down with her and violated her 3 And he became very attached to Dinah the daughter of Jacob and he fell in love with the young woman and spoke persuasively to her 4 Finally Shechem said to Hamor his father Get me this young woman to be my wife
5 When Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter his sons were with his herd in the field So Jacob kept silent until they returned 6 Later Hamor Shechems father went out to speak with Jacob 7 But the sons of Jacob heard about it and returned from the field right away They were offended and very angry because he had disgraced Israel by lying down with Jacobs daughter something that should not be done
8 Hamor spoke with them saying My son Shechem longs for your daughter Please give her to him as his wife 9 and form marriage alliances with us Give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves 10 You may dwell with us and the land will become available for you Dwell and carry on trade in it and settle in it 11 Then Shechem said to her father and to her brothers Let me find favor in your eyes and I will give you whatever you ask me 12 You can demand from me a very high bride price and gift I am willing to give whatever you may say to me Just give me the young woman as a wife
13 And Jacobs sons answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully because he had defiled Dinah their sister 14 They said to them We cannot possibly do such a thing to give our sister to a man who is not circumcised for that is a disgrace to us 15 We can only consent on this condition that you become like us and circumcise all your males 16 Then we will give our daughters to you and we will take your daughters for ourselves and we will dwell with you and become one people 17 But if you do not listen to us and get circumcised then we will take our daughter and go
18 Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem Hamors son 19 The young man did not delay in doing what they asked because he found delight in Jacobs daughter and he was the most honorable of the whole house of his father
20 So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the city gate and spoke to the men of their city saying 21 These men wish to be at peace with us Let them dwell in the land and carry on trade in it for the land is large enough to accommodate them We can take their daughters as wives and our daughters we can give to them 22 Only on this one condition will the men consent to dwell with us in order to become one people that every male among us be circumcised just the way they are circumcised 23 Then will not their possessions their wealth and all their livestock be ours So let us give them our consent that they may dwell with us 24 All those going out by the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to his son Shechem and all the males got circumcised all those going out of the city gate
25 However on the third day when they were still in pain two sons of Jacob Simeon and Levi Dinahs brothers each took his sword and went into the unsuspecting city and killed every male 26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and then took Dinah from Shechems house and left 27 Jacobs other sons came upon the slain men and plundered the city because they had defiled their sister 28 They took their flocks their herds their donkeys and whatever was in the city and in the field 29 They also took all their possessions captured all their little children and their wives and plundered everything in the houses
30 At this Jacob said to Simeon and to Levi You have brought great trouble on me in making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land to the Canaanites and the Perizzites I am few in number and they will certainly gather together to attack me and I will be annihilated I and my house 31 But they said Should anyone treat our sister like a prostitute
