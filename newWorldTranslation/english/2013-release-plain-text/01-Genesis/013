1 Abram then went up out of Egypt to the Negeb he and his wife and all that he had together with Lot 2 Abram was very rich in livestock silver and gold 3 He camped in one place after another as he traveled from the Negeb to Bethel until he arrived at the place where his tent had been between Bethel and Ai 4 to the place where he had previously built an altar There Abram called on the name of Jehovah
5 Now Lot who was traveling with Abram also owned sheep cattle and tents 6 So the land did not allow for all of them to stay in the same place their goods had become so many that they could no longer dwell together 7 As a result a quarrel arose between the herders of Abrams livestock and the herders of Lots livestock At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land 8 So Abram said to Lot Please there should be no quarreling between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen for we are brothers 9 Is not the whole land available to you Please separate from me If you go to the left then I will go to the right but if you go to the right then I will go to the left 10 So Lot raised his eyes and saw that the whole district of the Jordan was a well-watered region before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah like the garden of Jehovah like the land of Egypt as far as Zoar 11 Then Lot chose for himself the whole district of the Jordan and Lot moved his camp to the east So they separated from each other 12 Abram lived in the land of Canaan but Lot lived among the cities of the district Finally he set up his tent near Sodom 13 Now the men of Sodom were wicked gross sinners against Jehovah
14 Jehovah said to Abram after Lot had separated from him Raise your eyes please and look from the place where you are to the north and south east and west 15 because all the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring as a lasting possession 16 And I will make your offspring like the dust particles of the earth so that if anyone could count the dust particles of the earth then your offspring could be counted 17 Get up travel through the length and breadth of the land for to you I am going to give it 18 So Abram continued to live in tents Later he came and dwelled among the big trees of Mamre which are in Hebron and there he built an altar to Jehovah
