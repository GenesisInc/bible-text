1 Now Abrams wife Sarai had borne him no children but she had an Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar 2 So Sarai said to Abram Please now Jehovah has prevented me from bearing children Please have relations with my servant Perhaps I can have children by means of her So Abram listened to what Sarai said 3 After Abram had lived for ten years in the land of Canaan Abrams wife Sarai took her Egyptian servant Hagar and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife 4 So he had relations with Hagar and she became pregnant When she realized that she was pregnant she began to despise her mistress
5 At this Sarai said to Abram The injury done to me is your fault I was the one who put my servant in your arms but when she realized that she was pregnant she began to despise me May Jehovah judge between me and you 6 So Abram said to Sarai Look Your servant is under your authority Do to her whatever you think is best Then Sarai humiliated her and she ran away from her
7 Later Jehovahs angel found her at a spring of waters in the wilderness the spring on the way to Shur 8 And he said Hagar servant of Sarai where have you come from and where are you going To this she said I am running away from my mistress Sarai 9 Jehovahs angel then said to her Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand 10 Then Jehovahs angel said I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count 11 Jehovahs angel added Here you are pregnant and you will give birth to a son and you must name him Ishmael for Jehovah has heard your affliction 12 He will be a wild donkey of a man His hand will be against everyone and everyones hand will be against him and he will dwell opposite all his brothers
13 Then she called on the name of Jehovah who was speaking to her You are a God of sight  for she said Have I here actually looked upon the one who sees me 14 That is why the well was called Beer-lahai-roi It is between Kadesh and Bered 15 So Hagar bore to Abram a son and Abram named his son whom Hagar bore Ishmael 16 Abram was 86 years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him
