1 Now Abraham again took a wife and her name was Keturah 2 In time she bore him Zimran Jokshan Medan Midian Ishbak and Shuah
3 Jokshan became father to Sheba and Dedan
The sons of Dedan were Asshurim Letushim and Leummim
4 The sons of Midian were Ephah Epher Hanoch Abida and Eldaah
All of these were the sons of Keturah
5 Later on Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac 6 but Abraham gave gifts to his sons by his concubines Then while he was still alive he sent them eastward away from Isaac his son to the land of the East 7 The years of Abrahams life were 175 years 8 Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age old and satisfied and was gathered to his people 9 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite that is in front of Mamre 10 the field that Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah 11 After Abrahams death God continued to bless his son Isaac and Isaac was dwelling near Beer-lahai-roi
12 This is the history of Ishmael the son of Abraham whom Hagar the Egyptian the servant of Sarah bore to Abraham
13 Now these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names according to their family origins Ishmaels firstborn Nebaioth then Kedar Adbeel Mibsam 14 Mishma Dumah Massa 15 Hadad Tema Jetur Naphish and Kedemah 16 These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names by their settlements and by their encampments 12 chieftains according to their clans 17 And Ishmael lived for 137 years Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people 18 And they took up dwelling from Havilah near Shur which is close to Egypt as far as Assyria He settled near all his brothers
19 And this is the history of Isaac the son of Abraham
Abraham became father to Isaac 20 Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebekah the daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean of Paddan-aram the sister of Laban the Aramaean 21 And Isaac kept pleading with Jehovah regarding his wife because she was barren so Jehovah responded to his plea and his wife Rebekah became pregnant 22 And the sons within her began to struggle with each other so that she said If this is the way it is why should I go on living So she inquired of Jehovah 23 And Jehovah said to her Two nations are in your womb and two peoples will be separated from within you and the one nation will be stronger than the other nation and the older will serve the younger
24 When the time came for her to give birth look twins were in her womb 25 Then the first came out red all over and was like a garment of hair so they named him Esau 26 After that his brother came out and his hand was holding onto the heel of Esau so he named him Jacob Isaac was 60 years old when she gave birth to them
27 As the boys got bigger Esau became a skilled hunter a man of the field but Jacob was a blameless man dwelling in tents 28 And Isaac loved Esau because it meant game in his mouth whereas Rebekah loved Jacob 29 On one occasion Jacob was boiling some stew when Esau returned from the field exhausted 30 So Esau said to Jacob Quick please give me some of the red stew that you have there for I am exhausted That is why his name was Edom 31 To this Jacob said First sell me your right as firstborn 32 And Esau continued Here I am about to die What use is a birthright to me 33 And Jacob added Swear to me first So he swore to him and sold his right as firstborn to Jacob 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew and he ate and drank and he got up and went away Thus Esau despised the birthright
