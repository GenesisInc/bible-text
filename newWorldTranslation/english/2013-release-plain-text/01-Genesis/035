1 After that God said to Jacob Rise go up to Bethel and dwell there and make an altar there to the true God who appeared to you when you were running away from Esau your brother
2 Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him Get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst and cleanse yourselves and change your garments 3 and let us rise and go up to Bethel There I will make an altar to the true God who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone 4 So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the earrings that were in their ears and Jacob buried them under the big tree that was close to Shechem
5 When they traveled on the terror of God struck the cities around them so they did not chase after the sons of Jacob 6 Jacob eventually came to Luz that is Bethel in the land of Canaan he and all the people with him 7 There he built an altar and called the place El-bethel because there the true God had revealed himself to him when he had run away from his brother 8 Later Deborah Rebekahs nurse died and was buried at the foot of Bethel under an oak So he named it Allon-bacuth
9 God appeared to Jacob once again while he was coming from Paddan-aram and blessed him 10 God said to him Your name is Jacob Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel will be your name And he began to call him Israel 11 God further said to him I am God Almighty Be fruitful and become many Nations and a congregation of nations will come from you and kings will descend from you 12 As for the land that I have given to Abraham and to Isaac to you I will give it and to your offspring after you I will give the land 13 Then God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him
14 So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering on it and poured oil on it 15 And Jacob continued to call the place where God had spoken with him Bethel
16 Then they pulled away from Bethel And while they were still some distance from Ephrath Rachel began to give birth and her labor was very difficult 17 But while she was struggling to deliver the child the midwife said to her Do not be afraid for you will have this son also 18 Just as her life was slipping away for she was dying she named him Ben-oni but his father called him Benjamin 19 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath that is Bethlehem 20 Jacob set up a pillar over her grave it is the pillar of Rachels grave to this day
21 After that Israel pulled away and pitched his tent a distance beyond the tower of Eder 22 Once while Israel was dwelling in that land Reuben went and lay down with Bilhah his fathers concubine and Israel heard about it
So there were 12 sons of Jacob 23 The sons by Leah were Jacobs firstborn Reuben then Simeon Levi Judah Issachar and Zebulun 24 The sons by Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin 25 And the sons by Bilhah Rachels servant were Dan and Naphtali 26 And the sons by Zilpah Leahs servant were Gad and Asher These are Jacobs sons who were born to him in Paddan-aram
27 Jacob eventually came to where his father Isaac was at Mamre to Kiriath-arba that is Hebron where Abraham and also Isaac had resided as foreigners 28 Isaac lived to be 180 years old 29 Then Isaac breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people after a long and satisfying life and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him
