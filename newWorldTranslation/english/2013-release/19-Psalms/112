1 Praise Jah!
Happy is the man who fears Jehovah, [Beth]Who takes great pleasure in his commandments.
 2 His descendants will be mighty in the earth, [Daleth]And the generation of the upright will be blessed.
 3 Wealth and riches are in his house, [Waw]And his righteousness continues forever.
 4 To the upright he shines like a light in the darkness.
He is compassionate and merciful and righteous.
 5 It goes well for the man who generously lends.
He conducts his affairs with justice.
 6 He will never be shaken.
The righteous will be remembered forever.
 7 He will not fear bad news.
His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.
 8 His heart is unshakable; he is not afraid; [Ayin]In the end he will look in triumph on his adversaries.
 9 He has distributed widely; he has given to the poor.
His righteousness continues forever.
His own strength will be exalted with glory.
10 The wicked one will see and be upset.
He will grind his teeth and melt away.
The desires of the wicked will perish.
