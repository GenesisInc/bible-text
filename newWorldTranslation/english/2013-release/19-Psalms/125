A Song of the Ascents.
125 Those who trust in JehovahAre like Mount Zion, which cannot be shakenBut endures forever.
 2 Just as mountains surround Jerusalem,So Jehovah surrounds his peopleFrom now on and forever.
 3 The scepter of wickedness will not remain upon the land allotted to the righteous,So that the righteous do not turn to doing what is wrong.
 4 Do good, O Jehovah, to those who are good,To those who are upright in heart.
 5 As for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,Jehovah will remove them along with the wrongdoers.
May there be peace upon Israel.
