1
In
the
beginning
God
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
2
Now
the
earth
was
formless
and
desolate
and
there
was
darkness
upon
the
surface
of
the
watery
deep
and
Gods
active
force
was
moving
about
over
the
surface
of
the
waters
3
And
God
said
Let
there
be
light
Then
there
was
light
4
After
that
God
saw
that
the
light
was
good
and
God
began
to
divide
the
light
from
the
darkness
5
God
called
the
light
Day
but
the
darkness
he
called
Night
And
there
was
evening
and
there
was
morning
a
first
day
6
Then
God
said
Let
there
be
an
expanse
between
the
waters
and
let
there
be
a
division
between
the
waters
and
the
waters
7
Then
God
went
on
to
make
the
expanse
and
divided
the
waters
beneath
the
expanse
from
the
waters
above
the
expanse
And
it
was
so
8
God
called
the
expanse
Heaven
And
there
was
evening
and
there
was
morning
a
second
day
9
Then
God
said
Let
the
waters
under
the
heavens
be
collected
together
into
one
place
and
let
the
dry
land
appear
And
it
was
so
10
God
called
the
dry
land
Earth
but
the
collecting
of
the
waters
he
called
Seas
And
God
saw
that
it
was
good
11
Then
God
said
Let
the
earth
cause
grass
to
sprout
seed-bearing
plants
and
fruit
trees
according
to
their
kinds
yielding
fruit
along
with
seed
on
the
earth
And
it
was
so
12
And
the
earth
began
to
produce
grass
seed-bearing
plants
and
trees
yielding
fruit
along
with
seed
according
to
their
kinds
Then
God
saw
that
it
was
good
13
And
there
was
evening
and
there
was
morning
a
third
day
14
Then
God
said
Let
there
be
luminaries
in
the
expanse
of
the
heavens
to
make
a
division
between
the
day
and
the
night
and
they
will
serve
as
signs
for
seasons
and
for
days
and
years
15
They
will
serve
as
luminaries
in
the
expanse
of
the
heavens
to
shine
upon
the
earth
And
it
was
so
16
And
God
went
on
to
make
the
two
great
luminaries
the
greater
luminary
for
dominating
the
day
and
the
lesser
luminary
for
dominating
the
night
and
also
the
stars
17
Thus
God
put
them
in
the
expanse
of
the
heavens
to
shine
upon
the
earth
18
and
to
dominate
by
day
and
by
night
and
to
make
a
division
between
the
light
and
the
darkness
Then
God
saw
that
it
was
good
19
And
there
was
evening
and
there
was
morning
a
fourth
day
20
Then
God
said
Let
the
waters
swarm
with
living
creatures
and
let
flying
creatures
fly
above
the
earth
across
the
expanse
of
the
heavens
21
And
God
created
the
great
sea
creatures
and
all
living
creatures
that
move
and
swarm
in
the
waters
according
to
their
kinds
and
every
winged
flying
creature
according
to
its
kind
And
God
saw
that
it
was
good
22
With
that
God
blessed
them
saying
Be
fruitful
and
become
many
and
fill
the
waters
of
the
sea
and
let
the
flying
creatures
become
many
in
the
earth
23
And
there
was
evening
and
there
was
morning
a
fifth
day
24
Then
God
said
Let
the
earth
bring
forth
living
creatures
according
to
their
kinds
domestic
animals
and
creeping
animals
and
wild
animals
of
the
earth
according
to
their
kinds
And
it
was
so
25
And
God
went
on
to
make
the
wild
animals
of
the
earth
according
to
their
kinds
and
the
domestic
animals
according
to
their
kinds
and
all
the
creeping
animals
of
the
ground
according
to
their
kinds
And
God
saw
that
it
was
good
26
Then
God
said
Let
us
make
man
in
our
image
according
to
our
likeness
and
let
them
have
in
subjection
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
the
flying
creatures
of
the
heavens
and
the
domestic
animals
and
all
the
earth
and
every
creeping
animal
that
is
moving
on
the
earth
27
And
God
went
on
to
create
the
man
in
his
image
in
Gods
image
he
created
him
male
and
female
he
created
them
28
Further
God
blessed
them
and
God
said
to
them
Be
fruitful
and
become
many
fill
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
have
in
subjection
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
the
flying
creatures
of
the
heavens
and
every
living
creature
that
is
moving
on
the
earth
29
Then
God
said
Here
I
have
given
to
you
every
seed-bearing
plant
that
is
on
the
entire
earth
and
every
tree
with
seed-bearing
fruit
Let
them
serve
as
food
for
you
30
And
to
every
wild
animal
of
the
earth
and
to
every
flying
creature
of
the
heavens
and
to
everything
moving
on
the
earth
in
which
there
is
life
I
have
given
all
green
vegetation
for
food
And
it
was
so
31
After
that
God
saw
everything
he
had
made
and
look
it
was
very
good
And
there
was
evening
and
there
was
morning
a
sixth
day
1
Thus
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
everything
in
them
were
completed
2
And
by
the
seventh
day
God
had
completed
the
work
that
he
had
been
doing
and
he
began
to
rest
on
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
work
that
he
had
been
doing
3
And
God
went
on
to
bless
the
seventh
day
and
to
declare
it
sacred
for
on
it
God
has
been
resting
from
all
the
work
that
he
has
created
all
that
he
purposed
to
make
4
This
is
a
history
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
in
the
time
they
were
created
in
the
day
that
Jehovah
God
made
earth
and
heaven
5
No
bush
of
the
field
was
yet
on
the
earth
and
no
vegetation
of
the
field
had
begun
sprouting
because
Jehovah
God
had
not
made
it
rain
on
the
earth
and
there
was
no
man
to
cultivate
the
ground
6
But
a
mist
would
go
up
from
the
earth
and
it
watered
the
entire
surface
of
the
ground
7
And
Jehovah
God
went
on
to
form
the
man
out
of
dust
from
the
ground
and
to
blow
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
and
the
man
became
a
living
person
8
Further
Jehovah
God
planted
a
garden
in
Eden
toward
the
east
and
there
he
put
the
man
whom
he
had
formed
9
Thus
Jehovah
God
made
to
grow
out
of
the
ground
every
tree
that
was
pleasing
to
look
at
and
good
for
food
and
also
the
tree
of
life
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
and
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
bad
10
Now
there
was
a
river
flowing
out
of
Eden
to
water
the
garden
and
from
there
it
divided
into
four
rivers
11
The
name
of
the
first
is
Pishon
it
is
the
one
encircling
the
entire
land
of
Havilah
where
there
is
gold
12
The
gold
of
that
land
is
good
Bdellium
gum
and
onyx
stone
are
also
there
13
The
name
of
the
second
river
is
Gihon
it
is
the
one
encircling
the
entire
land
of
Cush
14
The
name
of
the
third
river
is
Hiddekel
it
is
the
one
going
to
the
east
of
Assyria
And
the
fourth
river
is
the
Euphrates
15
Jehovah
God
took
the
man
and
settled
him
in
the
garden
of
Eden
to
cultivate
it
and
to
take
care
of
it
16
Jehovah
God
also
gave
this
command
to
the
man
From
every
tree
of
the
garden
you
may
eat
to
satisfaction
17
But
as
for
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
bad
you
must
not
eat
from
it
for
in
the
day
you
eat
from
it
you
will
certainly
die
18
Then
Jehovah
God
said
It
is
not
good
for
the
man
to
continue
to
be
alone
I
am
going
to
make
a
helper
for
him
as
a
complement
of
him
19
Now
Jehovah
God
had
been
forming
from
the
ground
every
wild
animal
of
the
field
and
every
flying
creature
of
the
heavens
and
he
began
bringing
them
to
the
man
to
see
what
he
would
call
each
one
and
whatever
the
man
would
call
each
living
creature
that
became
its
name
20
So
the
man
named
all
the
domestic
animals
and
the
flying
creatures
of
the
heavens
and
every
wild
animal
of
the
field
but
for
man
there
was
no
helper
as
a
complement
of
him
21
So
Jehovah
God
caused
the
man
to
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
and
while
he
was
sleeping
he
took
one
of
his
ribs
and
then
closed
up
the
flesh
over
its
place
22
And
Jehovah
God
built
the
rib
that
he
had
taken
from
the
man
into
a
woman
and
he
brought
her
to
the
man
23
Then
the
man
said
This
is
at
last
bone
of
my
bonesAnd
flesh
of
my
flesh
This
one
will
be
called
Woman
Because
from
man
she
was
taken
24
That
is
why
a
man
will
leave
his
father
and
his
mother
and
he
will
stick
to
his
wife
and
they
will
become
one
flesh
25
And
both
of
them
continued
to
be
naked
the
man
and
his
wife
yet
they
were
not
ashamed
1
Now
the
serpent
was
the
most
cautious
of
all
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
that
Jehovah
God
had
made
So
it
said
to
the
woman
Did
God
really
say
that
you
must
not
eat
from
every
tree
of
the
garden
2
At
this
the
woman
said
to
the
serpent
We
may
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
of
the
garden
3
But
God
has
said
about
the
fruit
of
the
tree
that
is
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
You
must
not
eat
from
it
no
you
must
not
touch
it
otherwise
you
will
die
4
At
this
the
serpent
said
to
the
woman
You
certainly
will
not
die
5
For
God
knows
that
in
the
very
day
you
eat
from
it
your
eyes
will
be
opened
and
you
will
be
like
God
knowing
good
and
bad
6
Consequently
the
woman
saw
that
the
tree
was
good
for
food
and
that
it
was
something
desirable
to
the
eyes
yes
the
tree
was
pleasing
to
look
at
So
she
began
taking
of
its
fruit
and
eating
it
Afterward
she
also
gave
some
to
her
husband
when
he
was
with
her
and
he
began
eating
it
7
Then
the
eyes
of
both
of
them
were
opened
and
they
realized
that
they
were
naked
So
they
sewed
fig
leaves
together
and
made
loin
coverings
for
themselves
8
Later
they
heard
the
voice
of
Jehovah
God
as
he
was
walking
in
the
garden
about
the
breezy
part
of
the
day
and
the
man
and
his
wife
hid
from
the
face
of
Jehovah
God
among
the
trees
of
the
garden
9
And
Jehovah
God
kept
calling
to
the
man
and
saying
to
him
Where
are
you
10
Finally
he
said
I
heard
your
voice
in
the
garden
but
I
was
afraid
because
I
was
naked
so
I
hid
myself
11
At
that
he
said
Who
told
you
that
you
were
naked
Have
you
eaten
from
the
tree
from
which
I
commanded
you
not
to
eat
12
The
man
said
The
woman
whom
you
gave
to
be
with
me
she
gave
me
fruit
from
the
tree
so
I
ate
13
Jehovah
God
then
said
to
the
woman
What
is
this
you
have
done
The
woman
replied
The
serpent
deceived
me
so
I
ate
14
Then
Jehovah
God
said
to
the
serpent
Because
you
have
done
this
you
are
the
cursed
one
out
of
all
the
domestic
animals
and
out
of
all
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
On
your
belly
you
will
go
and
you
will
eat
dust
all
the
days
of
your
life
15
And
I
will
put
enmity
between
you
and
the
woman
and
between
your
offspring
and
her
offspring
He
will
crush
your
head
and
you
will
strike
him
in
the
heel
16
To
the
woman
he
said
I
will
greatly
increase
the
pain
of
your
pregnancy
in
pain
you
will
give
birth
to
children
and
your
longing
will
be
for
your
husband
and
he
will
dominate
you
17
And
to
Adam
he
said
Because
you
listened
to
your
wifes
voice
and
ate
from
the
tree
concerning
which
I
gave
you
this
command
You
must
not
eat
from
it

cursed
is
the
ground
on
your
account
In
pain
you
will
eat
its
produce
all
the
days
of
your
life
18
It
will
grow
thorns
and
thistles
for
you
and
you
must
eat
the
vegetation
of
the
field
19
In
the
sweat
of
your
face
you
will
eat
bread
until
you
return
to
the
ground
for
out
of
it
you
were
taken
For
dust
you
are
and
to
dust
you
will
return
20
After
this
Adam
named
his
wife
Eve
because
she
was
to
become
the
mother
of
everyone
living
21
And
Jehovah
God
made
long
garments
from
skins
for
Adam
and
for
his
wife
to
clothe
them
22
Jehovah
God
then
said
Here
the
man
has
become
like
one
of
us
in
knowing
good
and
bad
Now
in
order
that
he
may
not
put
his
hand
out
and
take
fruit
also
from
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
forever
—
23
With
that
Jehovah
God
expelled
him
from
the
garden
of
Eden
to
cultivate
the
ground
from
which
he
had
been
taken
24
So
he
drove
the
man
out
and
he
posted
at
the
east
of
the
garden
of
Eden
the
cherubs
and
the
flaming
blade
of
a
sword
that
was
turning
continuously
to
guard
the
way
to
the
tree
of
life
1
Now
Adam
had
sexual
relations
with
his
wife
Eve
and
she
became
pregnant
When
she
gave
birth
to
Cain
she
said
I
have
produced
a
male
child
with
the
help
of
Jehovah
2
Later
she
again
gave
birth
to
his
brother
Abel
Abel
became
a
shepherd
of
the
flock
but
Cain
became
a
cultivator
of
the
ground
3
After
some
time
Cain
brought
some
fruits
of
the
land
as
an
offering
to
Jehovah
4
But
Abel
brought
some
firstlings
of
his
flock
including
their
fat
While
Jehovah
looked
with
favor
on
Abel
and
on
his
offering
5
he
did
not
look
with
any
favor
on
Cain
and
on
his
offering
So
Cain
grew
hot
with
anger
and
was
dejected
6
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Cain
Why
are
you
so
angry
and
dejected
7
If
you
turn
to
doing
good
will
you
not
be
restored
to
favor
But
if
you
do
not
turn
to
doing
good
sin
is
crouching
at
the
door
and
its
craving
is
to
dominate
you
but
will
you
get
the
mastery
over
it
8
After
that
Cain
said
to
his
brother
Abel
Let
us
go
over
into
the
field
So
while
they
were
in
the
field
Cain
assaulted
his
brother
Abel
and
killed
him
9
Later
on
Jehovah
said
to
Cain
Where
is
your
brother
Abel
and
he
said
I
do
not
know
Am
I
my
brothers
guardian
10
At
this
He
said
What
have
you
done
Listen
Your
brothers
blood
is
crying
out
to
me
from
the
ground
11
And
now
you
are
cursed
in
banishment
from
the
ground
that
has
opened
its
mouth
to
receive
your
brothers
blood
from
your
hand
12
When
you
cultivate
the
ground
it
will
not
give
you
back
its
produce
You
will
become
a
wanderer
and
a
fugitive
in
the
earth
13
At
this
Cain
said
to
Jehovah
The
punishment
for
my
error
is
too
great
to
bear
14
Today
you
are
driving
me
from
the
land
and
I
will
be
hidden
from
your
face
and
I
will
become
a
wanderer
and
a
fugitive
on
the
earth
and
anyone
who
finds
me
will
certainly
kill
me
15
So
Jehovah
said
to
him
For
that
reason
anyone
who
kills
Cain
will
suffer
vengeance
seven
times
So
Jehovah
set
up
a
sign
for
Cain
in
order
that
no
one
finding
him
would
strike
him
16
Then
Cain
went
away
from
before
Jehovah
and
took
up
residence
in
the
land
of
Exile
to
the
east
of
Eden
17
Afterward
Cain
had
sexual
relations
with
his
wife
and
she
became
pregnant
and
gave
birth
to
Enoch
Then
he
engaged
in
building
a
city
and
named
the
city
after
his
son
Enoch
18
Later
Irad
was
born
to
Enoch
And
Irad
became
father
to
Mehujael
and
Mehujael
became
father
to
Methushael
and
Methushael
became
father
to
Lamech
19
Lamech
took
two
wives
for
himself
The
name
of
the
first
was
Adah
and
the
name
of
the
second
was
Zillah
20
Adah
gave
birth
to
Jabal
He
was
the
founder
of
those
who
dwell
in
tents
and
have
livestock
21
His
brothers
name
was
Jubal
He
was
the
founder
of
all
those
who
play
the
harp
and
the
pipe
22
Also
Zillah
gave
birth
to
Tubal-cain
who
forged
every
sort
of
tool
of
copper
and
iron
And
the
sister
of
Tubal-cain
was
Naamah
23
Then
Lamech
composed
these
words
for
his
wives
Adah
and
Zillah
Hear
my
voice
you
wives
of
Lamech
Give
ear
to
my
saying
A
man
I
have
killed
for
wounding
me
Yes
a
young
man
for
striking
me
24
If
7
times
Cain
is
to
be
avenged
Then
Lamech
77
times
25
Adam
again
had
sexual
relations
with
his
wife
and
she
gave
birth
to
a
son
She
named
him
Seth
because
as
she
said
God
has
appointed
for
me
another
offspring
in
place
of
Abel
because
Cain
killed
him
26
There
was
also
born
to
Seth
a
son
and
he
named
him
Enosh
At
that
time
people
began
calling
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
1
This
is
the
book
of
Adams
history
In
the
day
that
God
created
Adam
he
made
him
in
the
likeness
of
God
2
Male
and
female
he
created
them
On
the
day
they
were
created
he
blessed
them
and
named
them
Man
3
Adam
lived
for
130
years
and
then
became
father
to
a
son
in
his
likeness
in
his
image
and
he
named
him
Seth
4
After
becoming
father
to
Seth
Adam
lived
for
800
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and

5
So

After

lived
for
815
years
And
he
became
father
to

years
and

lived
for
70

13
After
becoming

to
Mahalalel
Kenan
lived
for
840
years
And
he
became
father
to

the
days
of
Kenan
amounted
to
910
years
and
then
he
died
15
Mahalalel
lived
for
65
years
and
then
became
father
to

16
After
becoming
father
to
Jared
Mahalalel
lived
for
830
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
17
So
all
the
days
of
Mahalalel
amounted
to
895
years
and
then
he
died
18
Jared
lived
for
162
years
and
then
became
father
to
Enoch
19
After
becoming
father
to
Enoch
Jared
lived
for
800
years
And
he
became

and
daughters
20
So

years
and
then
he
died
21
Enoch
lived
for
65
years
and
then
became
father
to
Methuselah
22
After
becoming
father
to
Methuselah
Enoch
continued
to
walk
with
the
true
God
for
300
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
23
So
all
the
days
of
Enoch
amounted
to
365
years
24
Enoch
kept
walking
with
the
true
God
Then
he
was
no
more
for
God
took
him
25
Methuselah
lived
for
187
years
and
then
became
father
to
Lamech
26
After
becoming
father
to
Lamech
Methuselah
lived
for
782
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
27
So

the
days
of
Methuselah
amounted
to
969
years
and
then
he
died
28
Lamech
lived
for
182
years
and
then
became
father
to
a
son
29
He
named
him
Noah
saying
This
one
will
bring
us
comfort
from
our
labor
and
from
the
painful
toil
of
our
hands
because
of
the
ground
that
Jehovah
has
cursed
30
After
becoming
father
to
Noah
Lamech
lived
for
595
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
31
So
all
the
days
of
Lamech
amounted
to
777
years
and
then
he
died
32
After
Noah
reached
500
years
of
age
he
became
father
to
Shem
Ham
and
Japheth
1
Now
when
men
started
to
grow
in
number
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
daughters
were
born
to
them
2
the
sons
of
the
true
God
began
to
notice
that
the
daughters
of
men
were
beautiful
So
they
began
taking
as
wives
all
whom
they
chose
3
Then
Jehovah
said
My
spirit
will
not
tolerate
man
indefinitely
because
he
is
only
flesh
Accordingly
his
days
will
amount
to
120
years
4
The
Nephilim
were
on
the
earth
in
those
days
and
afterward
During
that
time
the
sons
of
the
true
God
continued
to
have
relations
with
the
daughters
of
men
and
these
bore
sons
to
them
They
were
the
mighty
ones
of
old
times
the
men
of
fame
5
Consequently
Jehovah
saw
that
mans
wickedness
was
great
on
the
earth
and
that
every
inclination
of
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
was
only
bad
all
the
time
6
Jehovah
regretted
that
he
had
made
men
on
the
earth
and
his
heart
was
saddened
7
So
Jehovah
said
I
am
going
to
wipe
men
whom
I
have
created
off
the
surface
of
the
ground
man
together
with
domestic
animals
creeping
animals
and
flying
creatures
of
the
heavens
for
I
regret
that
I
have
made
them
8
But
Noah
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
9
This
is
the
history
of
Noah
Noah
was
a
righteous
man
He
proved
himself
faultless
among
his
contemporaries
Noah
walked
with
the
true
God
10
In
time
Noah
became
father
to
three
sons
Shem
Ham
and
Japheth
11
But
the
earth
had
become
ruined
in
the
sight
of
the
true
God
and
the
earth
was
filled
with
violence
12
Yes
God
looked
upon
the
earth
and
it
was
ruined
all
flesh
had
ruined
its
way
on
the
earth
13
After
that
God
said
to
Noah
I
have
decided
to
put
an
end
to
all
flesh
because
the
earth
is
full
of
violence
on
account
of
them
so
I
am
bringing
them
to
ruin
together
with
the
earth
14
Make
for
yourself
an
ark
from
resinous
wood
You
will
make
compartments
in
the
ark
and
cover
it
with
tar
inside
and
outside
15
This
is
how
you
will
make
it
The
ark
should
be
300
cubits
long
50
cubits
wide
and
30
cubits
high
16
You
will
make
a
window
for
light
for
the
ark
one
cubit
from
the
top
You
should
put
the
entrance
of
the
ark
in
its
side
and
make
it
with
a
lower
deck
a
second
deck
and
a
third
deck
17
As
for
me
I
am
going
to
bring
floodwaters
upon
the
earth
to
destroy
from
under
the
heavens
all
flesh
that
has
the
breath
of
life
Everything
on
the
earth
will
perish
18
And
I
am
establishing
my
covenant
with
you
and
you
must
go
into
the
ark
you
your
sons
your
wife
and
your
sons
wives
with
you
19
And
bring
into
the
ark
two
of
every
sort
of
living
creature
in
order
to
preserve
them
alive
with
you
a
male
and
a
female
20
of
the
flying
creatures
according
to
their
kinds
the
domestic
animals
according
to
their
kinds
and
all
creeping
animals
of
the
ground
according
to
their
kinds
two
of
each
will
go
in
there
to
you
to
preserve
them
alive
21
For
your
part
you
are
to
collect
and
take
with
you
every
kind
of
food
to
eat
to
serve
as
food
for
you
and
for
the
animals
22
And
Noah
did
according
to
all
that
God
had
commanded
him
He
did
just
so
1
After
that
Jehovah
said
to
Noah
Go
into
the
ark
you
and
all
your
household
because
you
are
the
one
I
have
found
to
be
righteous
before
me
among
this
generation
2
You
must
take
with
you
every
kind
of
clean
animal
by
sevens
the
male
and
its
mate
and
of
every
animal
that
is
not
clean
just
two
the
male
and
its
mate
3
also
of
the
flying
creatures
of
the
sky
by
sevens
male
and
female
to
preserve
their
offspring
alive
over
all
the
earth
4
For
in
just
seven
days
I
will
make
it
rain
on
the
earth
for
40
days
and
40
nights
and
I
will
wipe
from
the
surface
of
the
ground
every
living
thing
that
I
have
made
5
Then
Noah
did
everything
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
6
Noah
was
600
years
old
when
the
floodwaters
came
upon
the
earth
7
So
Noah
along
with
his
sons
his
wife
and
his
sons
wives
went
into
the
ark
ahead
of
the
floodwaters
8
Of
every
clean
animal
and
of
every
animal
that
is
not
clean
and
of
the
flying
creatures
and
of
everything
that
moves
on
the
ground
9
they
went
inside
the
ark
to
Noah
by
twos
male
and
female
just
as
God
had
commanded
Noah
10
And
seven
days
later
the
floodwaters
came
upon
the
earth
11
In
the
600th
year
of
Noahs
life
in
the
second
month
on
the
17th
day
of
the
month
on
that
day
all
the
springs
of
the
vast
watery
deep
burst
open
and
the
floodgates
of
the
heavens
were
opened
12
And
the
rain
poured
down
on
the
earth
for
40
days
and
40
nights
13
On
that
very
day
Noah
went
into
the
ark
along
with
his
sons
Shem
Ham
and
Japheth
and
his
wife
and
the
three
wives
of
his
sons
14
They
went
in
with
every
wild
animal
according
to
its
kind
and
every
domestic
animal
according
to
its
kind
and
every
creeping
animal
of
the
earth
according
to
its
kind
and
every
flying
creature
according
to
its
kind
every
bird
every
winged
creature
15
They
kept
going
to
Noah
inside
the
ark
two
by
two
of
every
sort
of
flesh
that
has
the
breath
of
life
16
So
they
went
in
male
and
female
of
every
sort
of
flesh
just
as
God
had
commanded
him
After
that
Jehovah
shut
the
door
behind
him
17
The
flooding
continued
for
40
days
on
the
earth
and
the
waters
kept
increasing
and
began
carrying
the
ark
and
it
was
floating
high
above
the
earth
18
The
waters
became
overwhelming
and
kept
increasing
greatly
upon
the
earth
but
the
ark
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
waters
19
The
waters
overwhelmed
the
earth
so
greatly
that
all
the
tall
mountains
under
the
whole
heavens
were
covered
20
The
waters
rose
up
to
15
cubits
above
the
mountains
21
So
all
living
creatures
that
were
moving
on
the
earth
perished—the
flying
creatures
the
domestic
animals
the
wild
animals
the
swarming
creatures
and
all
mankind
22
Everything
on
dry
land
that
had
the
breath
of
life
in
its
nostrils
died
23
So
He
wiped
every
living
thing
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
including
man
animals
creeping
animals
and
the
flying
creatures
of
the
sky
They
were
all
wiped
off
the
earth
only
Noah
and
those
with
him
in
the
ark
survived
24
And
the
waters
continued
overwhelming
the
earth
for
150
days
1
But
God
gave
attention
to
Noah
and
to
all
the
wild
animals
and
domestic
animals
that
were
with
him
in
the
ark
and
God
caused
a
wind
to
blow
over
the
earth
and
the
waters
began
to
subside
2
The
springs
of
the
watery
deep
and
the
floodgates
of
the
heavens
were
stopped
up
so
the
rain
from
the
heavens
stopped
falling
3
Then
the
waters
began
to
recede
progressively
from
the
earth
By
the
end
of
150
days
the
waters
had
subsided
4
In
the
seventh
month
on
the
17th
day
of
the
month
the
ark
came
to
rest
on
the
mountains
of
Ararat
5
And
the
waters
were
steadily
decreasing
until
the
tenth
month
In
the
tenth
month
on
the
first
of
the
month
the
tops
of
the
mountains
appeared
6
So
at
the
end
of
40
days
Noah
opened
the
window
that
he
had
made
in
the
ark
7
and
sent
out
a
raven
it
continued
flying
outside
and
returning
until
the
waters
dried
off
the
earth
8
Later
he
sent
out
a
dove
to
see
whether
the
waters
had
receded
from
the
surface
of
the
ground
9
The
dove
did
not
find
any
resting-place
to
perch
so
it
returned
to
him
into
the
ark
because
the
waters
were
still
covering
the
surface
of
the
whole
earth
So
he
reached
his
hand
out
and
brought
it
inside
the
ark
10
He
waited
seven
more
days
and
once
again
he
sent
out
the
dove
from
the
ark
11
When
the
dove
came
to
him
toward
evening
he
saw
that
there
was
a
freshly
plucked
olive
leaf
in
its
bill
So
Noah
knew
that
the
waters
had
receded
from
the
earth
12
He
waited
still
another
seven
days
Then
he
sent
out
the
dove
but
it
did
not
return
to
him
anymore
13
Now
in
the
601st
year
in
the
first
month
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
the
waters
had
drained
from
the
earth
and
Noah
removed
the
covering
of
the
ark
and
saw
that
the
surface
of
the
ground
was
drying
14
In
the
second
month
on
the
27th
day
of
the
month
the
earth
had
dried
off
15
God
now
said
to
Noah
16
Go
out
of
the
ark
you
your
wife
your
sons
and
your
sons
wives
17
Bring
out
with
you
all
the
living
creatures
of
every
sort
of
flesh
of
the
flying
creatures
and
of
the
animals
and
of
all
the
creeping
animals
of
the
earth
that
they
may
multiply
on
the
earth
and
be
fruitful
and
become
many
on
the
earth
18
So
Noah
went
out
together
with
his
sons
his
wife
and
his
sons
wives
19
Every
living
creature
every
creeping
animal
and
every
flying
creature
everything
that
moves
on
the
earth
went
out
of
the
ark
by
families
20
Then
Noah
built
an
altar
to
Jehovah
and
took
some
of
all
the
clean
animals
and
of
all
the
clean
flying
creatures
and
offered
burnt
offerings
on
the
altar
21
And
Jehovah
began
to
smell
a
pleasing
aroma
So
Jehovah
said
in
his
heart
Never
again
will
I
curse
the
ground
on
mans
account
for
the
inclination
of
the
heart
of
man
is
bad
from
his
youth
up
and
never
again
will
I
strike
down
every
living
thing
as
I
have
done
22
From
now
on
the
earth
will
never
cease
to
have
seed-sowing
and
harvest
cold
and
heat
summer
and
winter
and
day
and
night
1
God
went
on
to
bless
Noah
and
his
sons
and
to
say
to
them
Be
fruitful
and
become
many
and
fill
the
earth
2
A
fear
of
you
and
a
terror
of
you
will
continue
upon
every
living
creature
of
the
earth
and
upon
every
flying
creature
of
the
heavens
upon
everything
that
moves
on
the
ground
and
upon
all
the
fish
of
the
sea
They
are
now
given
into
your
hand
3
Every
moving
animal
that
is
alive
may
serve
as
food
for
you
Just
as
I
gave
you
the
green
vegetation
I
give
them
all
to
you
4
Only
flesh
with
its
life—its
blood—you
must
not
eat
5
Besides
that
I
will
demand
an
accounting
for
your
lifeblood
I
will
demand
an
accounting
from
every
living
creature
and
from
each
man
I
will
demand
an
accounting
for
the
life
of
his
brother
6
Anyone
shedding
mans
blood
by
man
will
his
own
blood
be
shed
for
in
Gods
image
He
made
man
7
As
for
you
be
fruitful
and
become
many
and
increase
abundantly
on
the
earth
and
multiply
8
Then
God
said
to
Noah
and
to
his
sons
with
him
9
I
am
now
establishing
my
covenant
with
you
and
with
your
offspring
after
you
10
and
with
every
living
creature
that
is
with
you
the
birds
the
animals
and
all
the
living
creatures
of
the
earth
with
you
all
those
that
came
out
of
the
ark—every
living
creature
of
the
earth
11
Yes
I
establish
my
covenant
with
you
Never
again
will
all
flesh
be
destroyed
by
the
waters
of
a
flood
and
never
again
will
a
flood
bring
the
earth
to
ruin
12
And
God
added
This
is
the
sign
of
the
covenant
that
I
am
making
between
me
and
you
and
every
living
creature
that
is
with
you
for
all
future
generations
13
I
put
my
rainbow
in
the
cloud
and
it
will
serve
as
a
sign
of
the
covenant
between
me
and
the
earth
14
Whenever
I
bring
a
cloud
over
the
earth
then
the
rainbow
will
certainly
appear
in
the
cloud
15
And
I
will
certainly
remember
my
covenant
that
I
made
between
me
and
you
and
every
living
creature
of
every
kind
and
never
again
will
the
waters
become
a
flood
to
destroy
all
flesh
16
And
the
rainbow
will
occur
in
the
cloud
and
I
will
certainly
see
it
and
remember
the
everlasting
covenant
between
God
and
every
living
creature
of
every
kind
on
the
earth
17
God
repeated
to
Noah
This
is
the
sign
of
the
covenant
that
I
establish
between
me
and
all
flesh
that
is
on
the
earth
18
Noahs
sons
who
came
out
of
the
ark
were
Shem
Ham
and
Japheth
Ham
later
became
the
father
of
Canaan
19
These
three
were
Noahs
sons
and
all
the
earths
population
came
from
them
and
spread
abroad
20
Now
Noah
started
off
as
a
farmer
and
he
planted
a
vineyard
21
When
he
drank
of
the
wine
he
became
intoxicated
and
he
uncovered
himself
inside
his
tent
22
Ham
the
father
of
Canaan
saw
his
fathers
nakedness
and
he
told
his
two
brothers
outside
23
So
Shem
and
Japheth
took
a
garment
and
put
it
upon
both
their
shoulders
and
walked
in
backward
Thus
they
covered
their
fathers
nakedness
while
their
faces
were
turned
away
and
they
did
not
see
their
fathers
nakedness
24
When
Noah
woke
up
from
his
wine
and
learned
what
his
youngest
son
had
done
to
him
25
he
said
Cursed
be
Canaan
Let
him
become
the
lowest
slave
to
his
brothers
26
And
he
added
Praised
be
Jehovah
the
God
of
Shem
And
let
Canaan
become
a
slave
to
him
27
Let
God
grant
ample
space
to
Japheth
And
let
him
reside
in
the
tents
of
Shem
Let
Canaan
become
a
slave
to
him
also
28
Noah
continued
to
live
for
350
years
after
the
Flood
29
So
all
the
days
of
Noah
amounted
to
950
years
and
he
died
1
This
is
the
history
of
Noahs
sons
Shem
Ham
and
Japheth
Sons
were
born
to
them
after
the
Flood
2
The
sons
of
Japheth
were
Gomer
Magog
Madai
Javan
Tubal
Meshech
and
Tiras
3
The
sons
of
Gomer
were
Ashkenaz
Riphath
and
Togarmah
4
The
sons
of
Javan
were
Elishah
Tarshish
Kittim
and
Dodanim
5
From
these
the
inhabitants
of
the
islands
spread
into
their
lands
according
to
their
languages
and
their
families
and
by
their
nations
6
The
sons
of
Ham
were
Cush
Mizraim
Put
and
Canaan
7
The
sons
of
Cush
were
Seba
Havilah
Sabtah
Raamah
and
Sabteca
The
sons
of
Raamah
were
Sheba
and
Dedan
8
Cush
became
father
to
Nimrod
He
was
the
first
to
become
a
mighty
one
on
the
earth
9
He
became
a
mighty
hunter
in
opposition
to
Jehovah
That
is
why
there
is
a
saying
Just
like
Nimrod
a
mighty
hunter
in
opposition
to
Jehovah
10
The
beginning
of
his
kingdom
was
Babel
Erech
Accad
and
Calneh
in
the
land
of
Shinar
11
From
that
land
he
went
into
Assyria
and
built
Nineveh
Rehoboth-Ir
Calah
12
and
Resen
between
Nineveh
and
Calah
This
is
the
great
city
13
Mizraim
became
father
to
Ludim
Anamim
Lehabim
Naphtuhim
14
Pathrusim
Casluhim
from
whom
the
Philistines
came
and
Caphtorim
15
Canaan
became
father
to
Sidon
his
firstborn
and
Heth
16
as
well
as
the
Jebusite
the
Amorite
the
Girgashite
17
the
Hivite
the
Arkite
the
Sinite
18
the
Arvadite
the
Zemarite
and
the
Hamathite
Afterward
the
families
of
the
Canaanites
were
scattered
19
So
the
boundary
of
the
Canaanites
was
from
Sidon
as
far
as
Gerar
near
Gaza
as
far
as
Sodom
Gomorrah
Admah
and
Zeboiim
near
Lasha
20
These
were
the
sons
of
Ham
according
to
their
families
and
their
languages
by
their
lands
and
their
nations
21
Children
were
also
born
to
Shem
the
forefather
of
all
the
sons
of
Eber
and
the
brother
of
Japheth
the
oldest
22
The
sons
of
Shem
were
Elam
Asshur
Arpachshad
Lud
and
Aram
23
The
sons
of
Aram
were
Uz
Hul
Gether
and
Mash
24
Arpachshad
became
father
to
Shelah
and
Shelah
became
father
to
Eber
25
Two
sons
were
born
to
Eber
The
name
of
the
one
was
Peleg
because
in
his
lifetime
the
earth
was
divided
The
name
of
his
brother
was
Joktan
26
Joktan
became
father
to
Almodad
Sheleph
Hazarmaveth
Jerah
27
Hadoram
Uzal
Diklah
28
Obal
Abimael
Sheba
29
Ophir
Havilah
and
Jobab
all
of
these
were
the
sons
of
Joktan
30
Their
place
of
dwelling
extended
from
Mesha
as
far
as
Sephar
the
mountainous
region
of
the
East
31
These
were
the
sons
of
Shem
according
to
their
families
and
their
languages
by
their
lands
and
their
nations
32
These
were
the
families
of
the
sons
of
Noah
according
to
their
family
lines
and
by
their
nations
From
these
the
nations
were
spread
abroad
in
the
earth
after
the
Flood
1
Now
all
the
earth
continued
to
be
of
one
language
and
of
one
set
of
words
2
As
they
traveled
eastward
they
discovered
a
valley
plain
in
the
land
of
Shinar
and
they
began
dwelling
there
3
Then
they
said
to
one
another
Come
Let
us
make
bricks
and
bake
them
with
fire
So
they
used
bricks
instead
of
stone
and
bitumen
as
mortar
4
They
now
said
Come
Let
us
build
a
city
for
ourselves
and
a
tower
with
its
top
in
the
heavens
and
let
us
make
a
celebrated
name
for
ourselves
so
that
we
will
not
be
scattered
over
the
entire
face
of
the
earth
5
Then
Jehovah
went
down
to
see
the
city
and
the
tower
that
the
sons
of
men
had
built
6
Jehovah
then
said
Look
They
are
one
people
with
one
language
and
this
is
what
they
have
started
to
do
Now
there
is
nothing
that
they
may
have
in
mind
to
do
that
will
be
impossible
for
them
7
Come
Let
us
go
down
there
and
confuse
their
language
in
order
that
they
may
not
understand
one
anothers
language
8
So
Jehovah
scattered
them
from
there
over
the
entire
face
of
the
earth
and
they
gradually
left
off
building
the
city
9
That
is
why
it
was
named
Babel
because
there
Jehovah
confused
the
language
of
all
the
earth
and
Jehovah
scattered
them
from
there
over
the
entire
face
of
the
earth
10
This
is
the
history
of
Shem
Shem
was
100
years
old
when
he
became
father
to
Arpachshad
two
years
after
the
Flood
11
After
becoming
father
to
Arpachshad
Shem
continued
to
live
500
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
12
Arpachshad
lived
for
35
years
and
then
became
father
to
Shelah
13
After
becoming
father
to
Shelah
Arpachshad
continued
to
live
403
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
14
Shelah
lived
for
30
years
and
then
became
father
to
Eber
15
After
becoming
father
to
Eber
Shelah
continued
to
live
403
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
16
Eber
lived
for
34
years
and
then
became
father
to
Peleg
17
After
becoming
father
to
Peleg
Eber
continued
to
live
430
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
18
Peleg
lived
for
30
years
and
then
became
father
to
Reu
19
After
becoming
father
to
Reu
Peleg
continued
to
live
209
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
20
Reu
lived
for
32
years
and
then
became
father
to
Serug
21
After
becoming
father
to
Serug
Reu
continued
to
live
207
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
22
Serug
lived
for
30
years
and
then
became
father
to
Nahor
23
After
becoming
father
to
Nahor
Serug
continued
to
live
200
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
24
Nahor
lived
for
29
years
and
then
became
father
to
Terah
25
After
becoming
father
to
Terah
Nahor
continued
to
live
119
years
And
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
26
Terah
lived
for
70
years
after
which
he
became
father
to
Abram
Nahor
and
Haran
27
This
is
the
history
of
Terah
Terah
became
father
to
Abram
Nahor
and
Haran
and
Haran
became
father
to
Lot
28
While
his
father
Terah
was
still
alive
Haran
died
in
the
land
of
his
birth
in
Ur
of
the
Chaldeans
29
Abram
and
Nahor
took
wives
for
themselves
The
name
of
Abrams
wife
was
Sarai
and
the
name
of
Nahors
wife
was
Milcah
the
daughter
of
Haran
the
father
of
Milcah
and
Iscah
30
Now
Sarai
was
barren
she
had
no
child
31
Terah
then
took
Abram
his
son
and
Lot
his
grandson
the
son
of
Haran
and
Sarai
his
daughter-in-law
the
wife
of
Abram
his
son
and
they
went
with
him
out
of
Ur
of
the
Chaldeans
to
go
to
the
land
of
Canaan
In
time
they
came
to
Haran
and
began
dwelling
there
32
The
days
of
Terah
were
205
years
Then
Terah
died
in
Haran
1
And
Jehovah
said
to
Abram
Go
out
from
your
land
and
away
from
your
relatives
and
from
the
house
of
your
father
to
the
land
that
I
will
show
you
2
I
will
make
you
a
great
nation
and
I
will
bless
you
and
I
will
make
your
name
great
and
you
will
become
a
blessing
3
I
will
bless
those
who
bless
you
and
I
will
curse
him
who
calls
down
evil
on
you
and
all
the
families
of
the
ground
will
certainly
be
blessed
by
means
of
you
4
So
Abram
went
just
as
Jehovah
had
told
him
and
Lot
went
with
him
Abram
was
75
years
old
when
he
left
Haran
5
Abram
took
his
wife
Sarai
and
Lot
the
son
of
his
brother
and
all
the
goods
that
they
had
accumulated
and
the
people
whom
they
had
acquired
in
Haran
and
they
set
out
for
the
land
of
Canaan
When
they
reached
the
land
of
Canaan
6
Abram
traveled
through
the
land
as
far
as
the
site
of
Shechem
near
the
big
trees
of
Moreh
At
that
time
the
Canaanites
were
in
the
land
7
Jehovah
then
appeared
to
Abram
and
said
To
your
offspring
I
am
going
to
give
this
land
So
he
built
an
altar
there
to
Jehovah
who
had
appeared
to
him
8
Later
he
moved
from
there
to
the
mountainous
region
east
of
Bethel
and
pitched
his
tent
with
Bethel
on
the
west
and
Ai
on
the
east
There
he
built
an
altar
to
Jehovah
and
began
to
call
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
9
Afterward
Abram
broke
camp
and
journeyed
toward
the
Negeb
moving
his
camp
from
one
place
to
another
10
Now
a
famine
arose
in
the
land
and
Abram
went
down
toward
Egypt
to
reside
there
for
a
while
because
the
famine
in
the
land
was
severe
11
As
he
was
about
to
enter
Egypt
he
said
to
his
wife
Sarai
Please
listen
I
know
what
a
beautiful
woman
you
are
12
So
when
the
Egyptians
see
you
they
will
surely
say
This
is
his
wife
Then
they
will
kill
me
but
keep
you
alive
13
Please
say
you
are
my
sister
so
that
it
may
go
well
with
me
because
of
you
and
my
life
will
be
spared
14
As
soon
as
Abram
entered
Egypt
the
Egyptians
noticed
that
the
woman
was
very
beautiful
15
And
the
princes
of
Pharaoh
also
saw
her
and
they
began
praising
her
to
Pharaoh
so
that
the
woman
was
taken
to
the
house
of
Pharaoh
16
He
treated
Abram
well
because
of
her
and
he
acquired
sheep
cattle
male
and
female
donkeys
male
and
female
servants
and
camels
17
Then
Jehovah
struck
Pharaoh
and
his
household
with
severe
plagues
because
of
Sarai
Abrams
wife
18
So
Pharaoh
called
Abram
and
said
What
is
this
you
have
done
to
me
Why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
she
was
your
wife
19
Why
did
you
say
She
is
my
sister

so
that
I
was
about
to
take
her
as
my
wife
Here
is
your
wife
Take
her
and
go
20
So
Pharaoh
gave
his
men
orders
concerning
him
and
they
sent
him
away
with
his
wife
and
all
that
he
had
1
Abram
then
went
up
out
of
Egypt
to
the
Negeb
he
and
his
wife
and
all
that
he
had
together
with
Lot
2
Abram
was
very
rich
in
livestock
silver
and
gold
3
He
camped
in
one
place
after
another
as
he
traveled
from
the
Negeb
to
Bethel
until
he
arrived
at
the
place
where
his
tent
had
been
between
Bethel
and
Ai
4
to
the
place
where
he
had
previously
built
an
altar
There
Abram
called
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
5
Now
Lot
who
was
traveling
with
Abram
also
owned
sheep
cattle
and
tents
6
So
the
land
did
not
allow
for
all
of
them
to
stay
in
the
same
place
their
goods
had
become
so
many
that
they
could
no
longer
dwell
together
7
As
a
result
a
quarrel
arose
between
the
herders
of
Abrams
livestock
and
the
herders
of
Lots
livestock
At
that
time
the
Canaanites
and
the
Perizzites
were
dwelling
in
the
land
8
So
Abram
said
to
Lot
Please
there
should
be
no
quarreling
between
me
and
you
and
between
my
herdsmen
and
your
herdsmen
for
we
are
brothers
9
Is
not
the
whole
land
available
to
you
Please
separate
from
me
If
you
go
to
the
left
then
I
will
go
to
the
right
but
if
you
go
to
the
right
then
I
will
go
to
the
left
10
So
Lot
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
that
the
whole
district
of
the
Jordan
was
a
well-watered
region
before
Jehovah
destroyed
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
like
the
garden
of
Jehovah
like
the
land
of
Egypt
as
far
as
Zoar
11
Then
Lot
chose
for
himself
the
whole
district
of
the
Jordan
and
Lot
moved
his
camp
to
the
east
So
they
separated
from
each
other
12
Abram
lived
in
the
land
of
Canaan
but
Lot
lived
among
the
cities
of
the
district
Finally
he
set
up
his
tent
near
Sodom
13
Now
the
men
of
Sodom
were
wicked
gross
sinners
against
Jehovah
14
Jehovah
said
to
Abram
after
Lot
had
separated
from
him
Raise
your
eyes
please
and
look
from
the
place
where
you
are
to
the
north
and
south
east
and
west
15
because
all
the
land
that
you
see
I
will
give
to
you
and
your
offspring
as
a
lasting
possession
16
And
I
will
make
your
offspring
like
the
dust
particles
of
the
earth
so
that
if
anyone
could
count
the
dust
particles
of
the
earth
then
your
offspring
could
be
counted
17
Get
up
travel
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
for
to
you
I
am
going
to
give
it
18
So
Abram
continued
to
live
in
tents
Later
he
came
and
dwelled
among
the
big
trees
of
Mamre
which
are
in
Hebron
and
there
he
built
an
altar
to
Jehovah
1
Now
in
the
days
of
Amraphel
king
of
Shinar
Arioch
king
of
Ellasar
Chedorlaomer
king
of
Elam
and
Tidal
king
of
Goiim
2
these
made
war
with
Bera
king
of
Sodom
Birsha
king
of
Gomorrah
Shinab
king
of
Admah
Shemeber
king
of
Zeboiim
and
the
king
of
Bela
that
is
Zoar
3
All
of
these
joined
forces
at
the
Valley
of
Siddim
that
is
the
Salt
Sea
4
They
had
served
Chedorlaomer
for
12
years
but
they
rebelled
in
the
13th
year
5
So
in
the
14th
year
Chedorlaomer
and
the
kings
who
were
with
him
came
and
defeated
the
Rephaim
in
Ashteroth-karnaim
the
Zuzim
in
Ham
the
Emim
in
Shaveh-kiriathaim
6
and
the
Horites
in
their
mountain
of
Seir
down
to
El-paran
which
is
at
the
wilderness
7
Then
they
turned
back
and
came
to
En-mishpat
that
is
Kadesh
and
conquered
the
whole
territory
of
the
Amalekites
and
also
the
Amorites
who
were
dwelling
in
Hazazon-tamar
8
At
this
point
the
king
of
Sodom
went
on
the
march
and
also
the
king
of
Gomorrah
the
king
of
Admah
the
king
of
Zeboiim
and
the
king
of
Bela
that
is
Zoar
and
they
drew
up
in
battle
formation
against
them
in
the
Valley
of
Siddim
9
against
Chedorlaomer
king
of
Elam
Tidal
king
of
Goiim
Amraphel
king
of
Shinar
and
Arioch
king
of
Ellasar—four
kings
against
the
five
10
Now
the
Valley
of
Siddim
was
full
of
bitumen
pits
and
the
kings
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
tried
to
escape
and
fell
into
them
and
those
who
remained
fled
to
the
mountainous
region
11
Then
the
victors
took
all
the
goods
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
all
their
food
and
went
on
their
way
12
They
also
took
Lot
the
son
of
Abrams
brother
who
was
dwelling
in
Sodom
as
well
as
his
goods
and
they
continued
on
their
way
13
After
that
a
man
who
had
escaped
came
and
told
Abram
the
Hebrew
He
was
then
dwelling
among
the
big
trees
of
Mamre
the
Amorite
the
brother
of
Eshcol
and
Aner
These
men
were
allies
of
Abram
14
Thus
Abram
heard
that
his
relative
had
been
taken
captive
With
that
he
mobilized
his
trained
men
318
servants
born
in
his
household
and
went
in
pursuit
up
to
Dan
15
During
the
night
he
divided
his
forces
and
he
and
his
servants
attacked
and
defeated
them
And
he
pursued
them
up
to
Hobah
which
is
north
of
Damascus
16
He
recovered
all
the
goods
and
he
also
recovered
Lot
his
relative
his
goods
the
women
and
the
other
people
17
After
Abram
returned
from
defeating
Chedorlaomer
and
the
kings
who
were
with
him
the
king
of
Sodom
went
out
to
meet
Abram
at
the
Valley
of
Shaveh
that
is
the
Valley
of
the
King
18
And
Melchizedek
king
of
Salem
brought
out
bread
and
wine
he
was
priest
of
the
Most
High
God
19
Then
he
blessed
him
and
said
Blessed
be
Abram
by
the
Most
High
God
Maker
of
heaven
and
earth
20
And
praised
be
the
Most
High
God
Who
has
handed
your
oppressors
over
to
you
And
Abram
gave
him
a
tenth
of
everything
21
After
that
the
king
of
Sodom
said
to
Abram
Give
me
the
people
but
take
the
goods
for
yourself
22
But
Abram
said
to
the
king
of
Sodom
I
raise
my
hand
in
an
oath
to
Jehovah
the
Most
High
God
Maker
of
heaven
and
earth
23
that
I
will
not
take
anything
that
is
yours
from
a
thread
to
a
sandal
lace
so
that
you
may
not
say
I
made
Abram
rich
24
I
will
take
nothing
except
what
the
young
men
have
already
eaten
As
for
the
share
of
the
men
who
went
with
me
Aner
Eshcol
and
Mamre—let
them
take
their
share
1
After
this
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Abram
in
a
vision
saying
Do
not
fear
Abram
I
am
a
shield
for
you
Your
reward
will
be
very
great
2
Abram
replied
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
what
will
you
give
me
seeing
that
I
continue
childless
and
the
one
who
will
inherit
my
house
is
a
man
of
Damascus
Eliezer
3
Abram
added
You
have
given
me
no
offspring
and
a
member
of
my
household
is
succeeding
me
as
heir
4
But
look
Jehovahs
word
in
reply
to
him
was
This
man
will
not
succeed
you
as
heir
but
your
own
son
will
succeed
you
as
heir
5
He
now
brought
him
outside
and
said
Look
up
please
to
the
heavens
and
count
the
stars
if
you
are
able
to
do
so
Then
he
said
to
him
So
your
offspring
will
become
6
And
he
put
faith
in
Jehovah
and
He
counted
it
to
him
as
righteousness
7
Then
he
added
I
am
Jehovah
who
brought
you
out
of
Ur
of
the
Chaldeans
to
give
you
this
land
as
your
possession
8
To
this
he
said
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
how
will
I
know
that
I
will
take
possession
of
it
9
He
replied
to
him
Take
for
me
a
three-year-old
heifer
a
three-year-old
female
goat
a
three-year-old
ram
a
turtledove
and
a
young
pigeon
10
So
he
took
all
of
these
and
cut
them
in
two
and
put
each
part
opposite
the
other
but
he
did
not
cut
up
the
birds
11
Then
the
birds
of
prey
began
to
descend
on
the
carcasses
but
Abram
kept
driving
them
away
12
When
the
sun
was
about
to
set
a
deep
sleep
fell
upon
Abram
and
a
great
and
frightening
darkness
descended
on
him
13
Then
He
said
to
Abram
Know
for
certain
that
your
offspring
will
be
foreigners
in
a
land
not
theirs
and
that
the
people
there
will
enslave
them
and
afflict
them
for
400
years
14
But
I
will
judge
the
nation
they
will
serve
and
after
that
they
will
go
out
with
many
goods
15
As
for
you
you
will
go
to
your
forefathers
in
peace
you
will
be
buried
at
a
good
old
age
16
But
they
will
return
here
in
the
fourth
generation
because
the
error
of
the
Amorites
has
not
yet
reached
its
full
measure
17
When
the
sun
had
set
and
it
had
become
very
dark
a
smoking
furnace
appeared
and
a
fiery
torch
passed
between
the
pieces
18
On
that
day
Jehovah
made
with
Abram
a
covenant
saying
To
your
offspring
I
will
give
this
land
from
the
river
of
Egypt
to
the
great
river
the
river
Euphrates
19
the
land
of
the
Kenites
the
Kenizzites
the
Kadmonites
20
the
Hittites
the
Perizzites
the
Rephaim
21
the
Amorites
the
Canaanites
the
Girgashites
and
the
Jebusites
1
Now
Abrams
wife
Sarai
had
borne
him
no
children
but
she
had
an
Egyptian
servant
whose
name
was
Hagar
2
So
Sarai
said
to
Abram
Please
now
Jehovah
has
prevented
me
from
bearing
children
Please
have
relations
with
my
servant
Perhaps
I
can
have
children
by
means
of
her
So
Abram
listened
to
what
Sarai
said
3
After
Abram
had
lived
for
ten
years
in
the
land
of
Canaan
Abrams
wife
Sarai
took
her
Egyptian
servant
Hagar
and
gave
her
to
her
husband
Abram
as
his
wife
4
So
he
had
relations
with
Hagar
and
she
became
pregnant
When
she
realized
that
she
was
pregnant
she
began
to
despise
her
mistress
5
At
this
Sarai
said
to
Abram
The
injury
done
to
me
is
your
fault
I
was
the
one
who
put
my
servant
in
your
arms
but
when
she
realized
that
she
was
pregnant
she
began
to
despise
me
May
Jehovah
judge
between
me
and
you
6
So
Abram
said
to
Sarai
Look
Your
servant
is
under
your
authority
Do
to
her
whatever
you
think
is
best
Then
Sarai
humiliated
her
and
she
ran
away
from
her
7
Later
Jehovahs
angel
found
her
at
a
spring
of
waters
in
the
wilderness
the
spring
on
the
way
to
Shur
8
And
he
said
Hagar
servant
of
Sarai
where
have
you
come
from
and
where
are
you
going
To
this
she
said
I
am
running
away
from
my
mistress
Sarai
9
Jehovahs
angel
then
said
to
her
Return
to
your
mistress
and
humble
yourself
under
her
hand
10
Then
Jehovahs
angel
said
I
will
greatly
multiply
your
offspring
so
that
they
will
be
too
numerous
to
count
11
Jehovahs
angel
added
Here
you
are
pregnant
and
you
will
give
birth
to
a
son
and
you
must
name
him
Ishmael
for
Jehovah
has
heard
your
affliction
12
He
will
be
a
wild
donkey
of
a
man
His
hand
will
be
against
everyone
and
everyones
hand
will
be
against
him
and
he
will
dwell
opposite
all
his
brothers
13
Then
she
called
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
who
was
speaking
to
her
You
are
a
God
of
sight

for
she
said
Have
I
here
actually
looked
upon
the
one
who
sees
me
14
That
is
why
the
well
was
called
Beer-lahai-roi
It
is
between
Kadesh
and
Bered
15
So
Hagar
bore
to
Abram
a
son
and
Abram
named
his
son
whom
Hagar
bore
Ishmael
16
Abram
was
86
years
old
when
Hagar
bore
Ishmael
to
him
1
When
Abram
was
99
years
old
Jehovah
appeared
to
Abram
and
said
to
him
I
am
God
Almighty
Walk
before
me
and
prove
yourself
faultless
2
I
will
establish
my
covenant
between
me
and
you
and
I
will
multiply
you
very
very
much
3
At
this
Abram
fell
facedown
and
God
continued
to
speak
with
him
saying
4
As
for
me
look
my
covenant
is
with
you
and
you
will
certainly
become
a
father
of
many
nations
5
Your
name
will
no
longer
be
Abram
your
name
will
become
Abraham
for
I
will
make
you
a
father
of
many
nations
6
I
will
make
you
very
very
fruitful
and
will
make
you
become
nations
and
kings
will
come
from
you
7
And
I
will
keep
my
covenant
between
me
and
you
and
your
offspring
after
you
throughout
their
generations
for
an
everlasting
covenant
to
be
God
to
you
and
to
your
offspring
after
you
8
And
I
will
give
to
you
and
to
your
offspring
after
you
the
land
in
which
you
lived
as
a
foreigner—the
entire
land
of
Canaan—for
a
lasting
possession
and
I
will
be
their
God
9
God
said
further
to
Abraham
As
for
you
you
are
to
keep
my
covenant
you
and
your
offspring
after
you
throughout
their
generations
10
This
is
my
covenant
between
me
and
you
that
you
and
your
offspring
after
you
will
keep
Every
male
among
you
must
get
circumcised
11
You
must
circumcise
the
flesh
of
your
foreskins
and
it
will
serve
as
a
sign
of
the
covenant
between
me
and
you
12
Throughout
your
generations
every
male
among
you
eight
days
old
must
be
circumcised
anyone
who
is
born
in
the
house
and
anyone
who
is
not
one
of
your
offspring
and
who
was
purchased
with
money
from
a
foreigner
13
Every
man
born
in
your
house
and
every
man
purchased
with
your
money
must
be
circumcised
and
my
covenant
in
your
flesh
must
serve
as
a
lasting
covenant
14
If
any
uncircumcised
male
will
not
circumcise
the
flesh
of
his
foreskin
that
person
must
be
cut
off
from
his
people
He
has
broken
my
covenant
15
Then
God
said
to
Abraham
As
for
your
wife
Sarai
you
must
not
call
her
Sarai
because
Sarah
will
become
her
name
16
I
will
bless
her
and
also
give
you
a
son
by
her
I
will
bless
her
and
she
will
become
nations
kings
of
peoples
will
come
from
her
17
At
this
Abraham
fell
facedown
and
began
to
laugh
and
to
say
in
his
heart
Will
a
man
100
years
old
have
a
child
born
to
him
and
will
Sarah
a
woman
90
years
old
give
birth
18
So
Abraham
said
to
the
true
God
O
that
Ishmael
might
live
before
you
19
To
this
God
said
Your
wife
Sarah
will
definitely
bear
you
a
son
and
you
must
name
him
Isaac
And
I
will
establish
my
covenant
with
him
for
an
everlasting
covenant
to
his
offspring
after
him
20
But
as
regards
Ishmael
I
have
heard
you
Look
I
will
bless
him
and
will
make
him
fruitful
and
will
multiply
him
very
very
much
He
will
produce
12
chieftains
and
I
will
make
him
become
a
great
nation
21
However
I
will
establish
my
covenant
with
Isaac
whom
Sarah
will
bear
to
you
at
this
appointed
time
next
year
22
When
God
finished
speaking
with
him
he
went
up
from
Abraham
23
Abraham
then
took
Ishmael
his
son
and
all
the
men
born
in
his
house
and
everyone
he
had
purchased
with
money
every
male
in
the
household
of
Abraham
and
he
circumcised
the
flesh
of
their
foreskins
on
that
very
day
just
as
God
had
spoken
with
him
24
Abraham
was
99
years
old
when
he
had
the
flesh
of
his
foreskin
circumcised
25
And
Ishmael
his
son
was
13
years
old
when
he
had
the
flesh
of
his
foreskin
circumcised
26
On
that
very
day
Abraham
was
circumcised
and
also
his
son
Ishmael
27
All
the
men
of
his
household
anyone
born
in
the
house
and
anyone
purchased
with
money
from
a
foreigner
were
also
circumcised
with
him
1
Afterward
Jehovah
appeared
to
him
among
the
big
trees
of
Mamre
while
he
was
sitting
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
during
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
2
He
looked
up
and
saw
three
men
standing
some
distance
from
him
When
he
saw
them
he
ran
from
the
entrance
of
the
tent
to
meet
them
and
he
bowed
down
to
the
ground
3
Then
he
said
Jehovah
if
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
please
do
not
pass
by
your
servant
4
Please
let
a
little
water
be
brought
and
have
your
feet
washed
then
recline
under
the
tree
5
Seeing
that
you
have
come
here
to
your
servant
let
me
bring
a
piece
of
bread
so
that
you
may
refresh
yourselves
Then
you
may
go
on
your
way
At
this
they
said
All
right
You
may
do
as
you
have
spoken
6
So
Abraham
hurried
to
the
tent
to
Sarah
and
said
Quick
Get
three
measures
of
fine
flour
knead
the
dough
and
make
loaves
of
bread
7
Next
Abraham
ran
to
the
herd
and
chose
a
tender
and
good
young
bull
He
gave
it
to
the
attendant
who
hurried
to
prepare
it
8
He
then
took
butter
and
milk
and
the
young
bull
that
he
had
prepared
and
set
the
food
before
them
Then
he
stood
by
them
under
the
tree
as
they
were
eating
9
They
said
to
him
Where
is
your
wife
Sarah
He
replied
Here
in
the
tent
10
So
one
of
them
continued
I
will
surely
return
to
you
next
year
at
this
time
and
look
your
wife
Sarah
will
have
a
son
Now
Sarah
was
listening
at
the
tent
entrance
which
was
behind
the
man
11
Abraham
and
Sarah
were
old
being
advanced
in
years
Sarah
was
past
the
age
of
childbearing
12
So
Sarah
began
to
laugh
to
herself
saying
After
I
am
worn
out
and
my
lord
is
old
will
I
really
have
this
pleasure
13
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Abraham
Why
did
Sarah
laugh
and
say
Am
I
really
going
to
give
birth
even
though
I
am
old
14
Is
anything
too
extraordinary
for
Jehovah
I
will
return
to
you
next
year
at
this
appointed
time
and
Sarah
will
have
a
son
15
But
Sarah
denied
it
saying
I
did
not
laugh
for
she
was
afraid
At
this
he
said
Yes
You
did
laugh
16
When
the
men
got
up
to
leave
and
looked
down
toward
Sodom
Abraham
was
walking
with
them
to
escort
them
17
Jehovah
said
Am
I
keeping
hidden
from
Abraham
what
I
am
going
to
do
18
Why
Abraham
is
surely
going
to
become
a
great
and
mighty
nation
and
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
will
be
blessed
by
means
of
him
19
For
I
have
come
to
know
him
in
order
that
he
may
command
his
sons
and
his
household
after
him
to
keep
Jehovahs
way
by
doing
what
is
right
and
just
so
that
Jehovah
may
bring
about
what
he
has
promised
concerning
Abraham
20
Then
Jehovah
said
The
outcry
against
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
is
indeed
great
and
their
sin
is
very
heavy
21
I
will
go
down
to
see
whether
they
are
acting
according
to
the
outcry
that
has
reached
me
And
if
not
I
can
get
to
know
it
22
Then
the
men
left
from
there
and
went
toward
Sodom
but
Jehovah
remained
with
Abraham
23
Then
Abraham
approached
and
said
Will
you
really
sweep
away
the
righteous
with
the
wicked
24
Suppose
there
are
50
righteous
men
within
the
city
Will
you
then
sweep
them
away
and
not
pardon
the
place
for
the
sake
of
the
50
righteous
who
are
inside
it
25
It
is
unthinkable
that
you
would
act
in
this
manner
by
putting
the
righteous
man
to
death
with
the
wicked
one
so
that
the
outcome
for
the
righteous
man
and
the
wicked
is
the
same
It
is
unthinkable
of
you
Will
the
Judge
of
all
the
earth
not
do
what
is
right
26
Then
Jehovah
said
If
I
find
in
Sodom
50
righteous
men
in
the
city
I
will
pardon
the
whole
place
for
their
sake
27
But
Abraham
again
responded
Please
here
I
have
presumed
to
speak
to
Jehovah
whereas
I
am
dust
and
ashes
28
Suppose
the
50
righteous
should
lack
five
Because
of
the
five
will
you
destroy
the
whole
city
To
this
he
said
I
will
not
destroy
it
if
I
find
there
45
29
But
yet
again
he
spoke
to
him
and
said
Suppose
40
are
found
there
He
answered
I
will
not
do
it
for
the
sake
of
the
40
30
But
he
continued
Jehovah
please
do
not
become
hot
with
anger
but
let
me
go
on
speaking
Suppose
only
30
are
found
there
He
answered
I
will
not
do
it
if
I
find
30
there
31
But
he
continued
Please
here
I
have
presumed
to
speak
to
Jehovah
Suppose
only
20
are
found
there
He
answered
I
will
not
destroy
it
for
the
sake
of
the
20
32
Finally
he
said
Jehovah
please
do
not
become
hot
with
anger
but
let
me
speak
just
once
more
Suppose
only
ten
are
found
there
He
answered
I
will
not
destroy
it
for
the
sake
of
the
ten
33
When
Jehovah
finished
speaking
to
Abraham
he
went
his
way
and
Abraham
returned
to
his
place
1
The
two
angels
arrived
at
Sodom
by
evening
and
Lot
was
sitting
in
the
gate
of
Sodom
When
Lot
saw
them
he
got
up
to
meet
them
and
bowed
down
with
his
face
to
the
earth
2
And
he
said
Please
my
lords
turn
aside
please
into
the
house
of
your
servant
and
stay
overnight
and
have
your
feet
washed
Then
you
may
get
up
early
and
travel
on
your
way
To
this
they
said
No
we
will
stay
overnight
in
the
public
square
3
But
he
was
so
insistent
with
them
that
they
went
with
him
to
his
house
Then
he
made
a
feast
for
them
and
he
baked
unleavened
bread
and
they
ate
4
Before
they
could
lie
down
to
sleep
the
men
of
the
city—the
men
of
Sodom
from
boy
to
old
man
all
of
them—surrounded
the
house
in
one
mob
5
And
they
kept
calling
out
to
Lot
and
saying
to
him
Where
are
the
men
who
came
in
to
you
tonight
Bring
them
out
to
us
so
that
we
may
have
sex
with
them
6
Then
Lot
went
out
to
them
to
the
doorway
and
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
7
He
said
Please
my
brothers
do
not
act
wickedly
8
Please
here
I
have
two
daughters
who
have
never
had
sexual
relations
with
a
man
Please
let
me
bring
them
out
to
you
for
you
to
do
to
them
whatever
seems
good
to
you
But
do
not
do
anything
to
these
men
for
they
have
come
under
the
shelter
of
my
roof
9
At
this
they
said
Stand
back
And
they
added
This
lone
foreigner
came
to
live
here
and
yet
he
dares
to
judge
us
Now
we
are
going
to
do
worse
to
you
than
to
them
And
they
crowded
in
on
Lot
and
moved
forward
to
break
down
the
door
10
So
the
men
reached
out
their
hands
and
brought
Lot
into
the
house
with
them
and
they
shut
the
door
11
But
they
struck
the
men
who
were
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
with
blindness
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
so
that
they
wore
themselves
out
trying
to
find
the
doorway
12
Then
the
men
said
to
Lot
Do
you
have
anyone
else
here
Sons-in-law
your
sons
your
daughters
and
all
your
people
in
the
city
bring
out
of
this
place
13
For
we
are
going
to
destroy
this
place
because
the
outcry
against
them
has
indeed
grown
great
before
Jehovah
so
that
Jehovah
sent
us
to
destroy
the
city
14
So
Lot
went
out
and
began
to
speak
to
his
sons-in-law
who
were
to
marry
his
daughters
and
he
kept
saying
Get
up
Get
out
of
this
place
because
Jehovah
will
destroy
the
city
But
to
his
sons-in-law
he
seemed
to
be
joking
15
As
dawn
was
breaking
the
angels
became
urgent
with
Lot
saying
Get
up
Take
your
wife
and
your
two
daughters
who
are
here
with
you
so
that
you
will
not
be
swept
away
in
the
error
of
the
city
16
When
he
kept
lingering
then
because
of
Jehovahs
compassion
for
him
the
men
seized
hold
of
his
hand
and
the
hand
of
his
wife
and
the
hands
of
his
two
daughters
and
they
brought
him
out
and
stationed
him
outside
the
city
17
As
soon
as
they
had
brought
them
to
the
outskirts
he
said
Escape
for
your
life
Do
not
look
behind
you
and
do
not
stand
still
in
any
part
of
the
district
Escape
to
the
mountainous
region
so
that
you
may
not
be
swept
away
18
Then
Lot
said
to
them
Not
there
please
Jehovah
19
Please
now
your
servant
has
found
favor
in
your
eyes
and
you
are
showing
great
kindness
to
me
by
preserving
me
alive
but
I
am
not
able
to
flee
to
the
mountainous
region
because
I
am
afraid
that
disaster
may
overtake
me
and
I
will
die
20
Please
now
this
town
is
nearby
and
I
can
flee
there
it
is
only
a
small
place
May
I
please
escape
there
It
is
only
a
small
place
Then
I
will
survive
21
So
he
said
to
him
Very
well
I
will
also
show
you
consideration
by
not
overthrowing
the
town
you
speak
of
22
Hurry
Escape
there
because
I
cannot
do
anything
until
you
arrive
there
That
is
why
he
named
the
town
Zoar
23
The
sun
had
risen
over
the
land
when
Lot
arrived
at
Zoar
24
Then
Jehovah
made
it
rain
sulfur
and
fire
on
Sodom
and
Gomorrah—it
came
from
Jehovah
from
the
heavens
25
So
he
overthrew
these
cities
yes
the
entire
district
including
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
cities
and
the
plants
of
the
ground
26
But
Lots
wife
who
was
behind
him
began
to
look
back
and
she
became
a
pillar
of
salt
27
Now
Abraham
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
went
to
the
place
where
he
had
stood
before
Jehovah
28
When
he
looked
down
toward
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
all
the
land
of
the
district
he
saw
quite
a
sight
There
was
dense
smoke
rising
from
the
land
like
the
dense
smoke
of
a
kiln
29
So
when
God
destroyed
the
cities
of
the
district
God
kept
Abraham
in
mind
by
sending
Lot
out
from
the
cities
he
overthrew
the
cities
where
Lot
had
been
dwelling
30
Later
Lot
went
up
from
Zoar
with
his
two
daughters
and
began
living
in
the
mountainous
region
because
he
was
afraid
to
live
in
Zoar
So
he
began
living
in
a
cave
with
his
two
daughters
31
And
the
firstborn
said
to
the
younger
Our
father
is
old
and
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
land
to
have
relations
with
us
according
to
the
custom
of
the
whole
earth
32
Come
let
us
give
our
father
wine
to
drink
and
let
us
lie
down
with
him
and
preserve
offspring
from
our
father
33
So
that
night
they
kept
giving
their
father
wine
to
drink
then
the
firstborn
went
in
and
lay
down
with
her
father
but
he
did
not
know
when
she
lay
down
and
when
she
got
up
34
Then
on
the
next
day
the
firstborn
said
to
the
younger
Here
I
lay
down
with
my
father
last
night
Let
us
give
him
wine
to
drink
tonight
also
Then
you
go
in
and
lie
down
with
him
and
let
us
preserve
offspring
from
our
father
35
So
that
night
also
they
repeatedly
gave
their
father
wine
to
drink
then
the
younger
went
and
lay
down
with
him
but
he
did
not
know
when
she
lay
down
and
when
she
got
up
36
So
both
daughters
of
Lot
became
pregnant
by
their
father
37
The
firstborn
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
named
him
Moab
He
is
the
father
of
the
Moabites
of
today
38
The
younger
also
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
she
named
him
Ben-ammi
He
is
the
father
of
the
Ammonites
of
today
1
Now
Abraham
moved
his
camp
from
there
to
the
land
of
the
Negeb
and
began
dwelling
between
Kadesh
and
Shur
While
he
was
residing
at
Gerar
2
Abraham
repeated
concerning
his
wife
Sarah
She
is
my
sister
So
Abimelech
king
of
Gerar
sent
for
Sarah
and
took
her
3
Afterward
God
came
by
night
to
Abimelech
in
a
dream
and
said
to
him
Here
you
are
as
good
as
dead
because
of
the
woman
whom
you
have
taken
since
she
is
married
and
belongs
to
another
man
4
However
Abimelech
had
not
gone
near
her
So
he
said
Jehovah
will
you
kill
a
nation
that
is
really
innocent
5
Did
he
not
say
to
me
She
is
my
sister

and
did
she
too
not
say
He
is
my
brother
I
did
this
with
an
honest
heart
and
innocent
hands
6
Then
the
true
God
said
to
him
in
the
dream
I
know
that
you
did
this
with
an
honest
heart
so
I
held
you
back
from
sinning
against
me
That
is
why
I
did
not
allow
you
to
touch
her
7
Now
return
the
mans
wife
for
he
is
a
prophet
and
he
will
make
supplication
for
you
and
you
will
keep
living
But
if
you
are
not
returning
her
know
that
you
will
surely
die
you
and
all
who
are
yours
8
Abimelech
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
called
all
his
servants
and
told
them
all
these
things
and
they
became
very
frightened
9
Then
Abimelech
called
Abraham
and
said
to
him
What
have
you
done
to
us
What
sin
have
I
committed
against
you
that
you
would
bring
upon
me
and
my
kingdom
such
a
great
sin
What
you
have
done
to
me
was
not
right
10
And
Abimelech
went
on
to
say
to
Abraham
What
were
your
intentions
when
you
did
this
thing
11
Abraham
said
It
was
because
I
said
to
myself
Surely
there
is
no
fear
of
God
in
this
place
and
they
will
kill
me
because
of
my
wife
12
And
besides
she
really
is
my
sister
the
daughter
of
my
father
but
not
the
daughter
of
my
mother
and
she
became
my
wife
13
So
when
God
caused
me
to
wander
from
the
house
of
my
father
I
said
to
her
Let
this
be
how
you
show
loyal
love
to
me
Everywhere
we
go
say
of
me
He
is
my
brother
14
Abimelech
then
took
sheep
and
cattle
and
male
and
female
servants
and
gave
them
to
Abraham
and
he
returned
his
wife
Sarah
to
him
15
Abimelech
also
said
Here
my
land
is
available
to
you
Dwell
wherever
you
please
16
And
to
Sarah
he
said
Here
I
give
1000
pieces
of
silver
to
your
brother
It
is
a
sign
of
your
innocence
to
all
who
are
with
you
and
before
everybody
and
you
are
cleared
of
reproach
17
And
Abraham
began
to
make
supplication
to
the
true
God
and
God
healed
Abimelech
and
his
wife
and
his
slave
girls
and
they
began
having
children
18
for
Jehovah
had
made
all
the
women
of
the
house
of
Abimelech
barren
because
of
Sarah
Abrahams
wife
1
Jehovah
turned
his
attention
to
Sarah
just
as
he
had
said
and
Jehovah
did
for
Sarah
what
he
had
promised
2
So
Sarah
became
pregnant
and
then
bore
a
son
to
Abraham
in
his
old
age
at
the
appointed
time
God
had
promised
him
3
Abraham
named
his
newborn
son
whom
Sarah
bore
to
him
Isaac
4
And
Abraham
circumcised
his
son
Isaac
when
he
was
eight
days
old
just
as
God
had
commanded
him
5
Abraham
was
100
years
old
when
his
son
Isaac
was
born
to
him
6
Then
Sarah
said
God
has
brought
me
laughter
everybody
hearing
of
it
will
laugh
with
me
7
And
she
added
Who
would
have
said
to
Abraham
Sarah
will
certainly
nurse
children
Yet
I
have
given
birth
to
a
son
for
him
in
his
old
age
8
Now
the
child
grew
and
was
weaned
and
Abraham
prepared
a
big
feast
on
the
day
that
Isaac
was
weaned
9
But
Sarah
kept
noticing
that
the
son
of
Hagar
the
Egyptian
whom
she
had
borne
to
Abraham
was
mocking
Isaac
10
So
she
said
to
Abraham
Drive
out
this
slave
girl
and
her
son
for
the
son
of
this
slave
girl
is
not
going
to
be
an
heir
along
with
my
son
with
Isaac
11
But
what
she
said
about
his
son
was
very
displeasing
to
Abraham
12
Then
God
said
to
Abraham
Do
not
be
displeased
by
what
Sarah
is
saying
to
you
about
the
boy
and
about
your
slave
girl
Listen
to
her
for
what
will
be
called
your
offspring
will
be
through
Isaac
13
As
for
the
son
of
the
slave
girl
I
will
also
make
a
nation
out
of
him
because
he
is
your
offspring
14
So
Abraham
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
took
bread
and
a
skin
bottle
of
water
and
gave
it
to
Hagar
He
set
these
on
her
shoulder
and
then
sent
her
away
along
with
the
boy
So
she
departed
and
wandered
about
in
the
wilderness
of
Beer-sheba
15
Finally
the
water
in
the
skin
bottle
was
used
up
and
she
pushed
the
boy
under
one
of
the
bushes
16
Then
she
went
on
and
sat
down
by
herself
about
the
distance
of
a
bowshot
away
because
she
said
I
do
not
want
to
watch
the
boy
die
So
she
sat
down
at
a
distance
and
began
to
cry
aloud
and
to
weep
17
At
that
God
heard
the
voice
of
the
boy
and
Gods
angel
called
to
Hagar
from
the
heavens
and
said
to
her
What
is
the
matter
with
you
Hagar
Do
not
be
afraid
for
God
has
heard
the
voice
of
the
boy
there
where
he
is
18
Get
up
lift
the
boy
and
take
hold
of
him
with
your
hand
for
I
will
make
him
a
great
nation
19
Then
God
opened
her
eyes
and
she
saw
a
well
of
water
and
she
went
and
filled
the
skin
bottle
with
water
and
gave
the
boy
a
drink
20
And
God
was
with
the
boy
as
he
grew
up
He
lived
in
the
wilderness
and
became
an
archer
21
He
took
up
dwelling
in
the
wilderness
of
Paran
and
his
mother
took
a
wife
for
him
from
the
land
of
Egypt
22
At
that
time
Abimelech
together
with
Phicol
the
chief
of
his
army
said
to
Abraham
God
is
with
you
in
everything
you
are
doing
23
So
now
swear
to
me
here
by
God
that
you
will
not
deal
falsely
with
me
and
with
my
offspring
and
with
my
descendants
and
that
you
will
deal
with
me
and
with
the
land
where
you
have
been
residing
with
the
same
loyal
love
that
I
have
shown
you
24
So
Abraham
said
I
swear
to
this
25
However
Abraham
complained
to
Abimelech
about
the
well
of
water
that
the
servants
of
Abimelech
had
violently
seized
26
Abimelech
replied
I
do
not
know
who
did
this
you
did
not
tell
me
about
it
and
I
heard
nothing
about
it
until
today
27
At
that
Abraham
took
sheep
and
cattle
and
gave
them
to
Abimelech
and
the
two
of
them
made
a
covenant
28
When
Abraham
set
seven
female
lambs
apart
from
the
flock
by
themselves
29
Abimelech
said
to
Abraham
Why
have
you
set
these
seven
female
lambs
here
by
themselves
30
Then
he
said
You
are
to
accept
the
seven
female
lambs
from
my
hand
as
a
witness
that
I
dug
this
well
31
That
is
why
he
called
that
place
Beer-sheba
because
there
both
of
them
had
taken
an
oath
32
So
they
made
a
covenant
at
Beer-sheba
after
which
Abimelech
got
up
together
with
Phicol
the
chief
of
his
army
and
they
returned
to
the
land
of
the
Philistines
33
After
that
he
planted
a
tamarisk
tree
at
Beer-sheba
and
there
he
called
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
the
everlasting
God
34
And
Abraham
stayed
in
the
land
of
the
Philistines
for
a
long
time
1
Now
after
this
the
true
God
put
Abraham
to
the
test
and
he
said
to
him
Abraham
to
which
he
replied
Here
I
am
2
Then
he
said
Take
please
your
son
your
only
son
whom
you
so
love
Isaac
and
travel
to
the
land
of
Moriah
and
offer
him
up
there
as
a
burnt
offering
on
one
of
the
mountains
that
I
will
designate
to
you
3
So
Abraham
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
saddled
his
donkey
and
took
two
of
his
servants
along
with
him
and
his
son
Isaac
He
split
the
wood
for
the
burnt
offering
and
then
he
rose
and
traveled
to
the
place
that
the
true
God
indicated
to
him
4
On
the
third
day
Abraham
looked
up
and
saw
the
place
from
a
distance
5
Abraham
now
said
to
his
servants
You
stay
here
with
the
donkey
but
the
boy
and
I
will
go
over
there
and
worship
and
return
to
you
6
So
Abraham
took
the
wood
for
the
burnt
offering
and
put
it
on
his
son
Isaac
Then
he
took
in
his
hands
the
fire
and
the
knife
and
the
two
of
them
walked
on
together
7
Then
Isaac
said
to
his
father
Abraham
My
father
He
replied
Yes
my
son
So
he
continued
Here
are
the
fire
and
the
wood
but
where
is
the
sheep
for
the
burnt
offering
8
To
this
Abraham
said
God
himself
will
provide
the
sheep
for
the
burnt
offering
my
son
And
both
of
them
walked
on
together
9
Finally
they
reached
the
place
that
the
true
God
had
indicated
to
him
and
Abraham
built
an
altar
there
and
arranged
the
wood
on
it
He
bound
his
son
Isaac
hand
and
foot
and
put
him
on
the
altar
on
top
of
the
wood
10
Then
Abraham
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
the
knife
to
kill
his
son
11
But
Jehovahs
angel
called
to
him
from
the
heavens
and
said
Abraham
Abraham
to
which
he
answered
Here
I
am
12
Then
he
said
Do
not
harm
the
boy
and
do
not
do
anything
at
all
to
him
for
now
I
do
know
that
you
are
God-fearing
because
you
have
not
withheld
your
son
your
only
one
from
me
13
At
that
Abraham
looked
up
and
there
just
beyond
him
was
a
ram
caught
by
its
horns
in
a
thicket
So
Abraham
went
and
took
the
ram
and
offered
it
up
as
a
burnt
offering
in
place
of
his
son
14
And
Abraham
named
that
place
Jehovah-jireh
This
is
why
it
is
still
said
today
In
the
mountain
of
Jehovah
it
will
be
provided
15
And
Jehovahs
angel
called
to
Abraham
a
second
time
from
the
heavens
16
saying
By
myself
I
swear

declares
Jehovah
that
because
you
have
done
this
and
you
have
not
withheld
your
son
your
only
one
17
I
will
surely
bless
you
and
I
will
surely
multiply
your
offspring
like
the
stars
of
the
heavens
and
like
the
grains
of
sand
on
the
seashore
and
your
offspring
will
take
possession
of
the
gate
of
his
enemies
18
And
by
means
of
your
offspring
all
nations
of
the
earth
will
obtain
a
blessing
for
themselves
because
you
have
listened
to
my
voice
19
After
that
Abraham
returned
to
his
servants
and
they
got
up
and
went
back
together
to
Beer-sheba
and
Abraham
continued
to
dwell
at
Beer-sheba
20
After
this
it
was
reported
to
Abraham
Here
Milcah
has
also
borne
sons
to
Nahor
your
brother
21
Uz
his
firstborn
Buz
his
brother
Kemuel
the
father
of
Aram
22
Chesed
Hazo
Pildash
Jidlaph
and
Bethuel
23
Bethuel
became
the
father
of
Rebekah
Milcah
bore
these
eight
to
Nahor
the
brother
of
Abraham
24
His
concubine
whose
name
was
Reumah
also
bore
sons
Tebah
Gaham
Tahash
and
Maacah
1
And
Sarah
lived
for
127
years
these
were
the
years
of
Sarahs
life
2
So
Sarah
died
in
Kiriath-arba
that
is
Hebron
in
the
land
of
Canaan
and
Abraham
began
to
mourn
and
to
weep
over
Sarah
3
Then
Abraham
got
up
from
before
his
dead
wife
and
he
said
to
the
sons
of
Heth
4
I
am
a
foreigner
and
settler
among
you
Give
me
a
property
to
serve
as
a
burial
place
in
your
midst
so
that
I
may
remove
my
dead
for
burial
5
At
this
the
sons
of
Heth
answered
Abraham
6
Hear
us
my
lord
You
are
a
chieftain
of
God
among
us
You
may
bury
your
dead
in
the
choicest
of
our
burial
places
None
of
us
will
hold
back
his
burial
place
from
you
to
prevent
you
from
burying
your
dead
7
So
Abraham
got
up
and
bowed
down
to
the
people
of
the
land
to
the
sons
of
Heth
8
and
said
to
them
If
you
agree
to
let
me
remove
my
dead
for
burial
then
listen
to
me
and
urge
Ephron
the
son
of
Zohar
9
to
sell
me
the
cave
of
Machpelah
which
belongs
to
him
it
is
at
the
edge
of
his
field
Let
him
sell
it
to
me
in
your
presence
for
the
full
amount
of
silver
so
that
I
may
have
a
property
for
a
burial
place
10
Now
Ephron
was
sitting
among
the
sons
of
Heth
So
Ephron
the
Hittite
answered
Abraham
in
the
hearing
of
the
sons
of
Heth
and
before
all
who
entered
the
gate
of
his
city
saying
11
No
my
lord
Listen
to
me
I
give
you
both
the
field
and
the
cave
that
is
in
it
In
the
presence
of
the
sons
of
my
people
I
give
it
to
you
Bury
your
dead
12
At
that
Abraham
bowed
down
before
the
people
of
the
land
13
and
spoke
to
Ephron
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
saying
Listen
to
me
if
you
will
I
will
give
you
the
full
amount
of
silver
for
the
field
Take
it
from
me
in
order
that
I
may
bury
my
dead
there
14
Then
Ephron
answered
Abraham
15
My
lord
listen
to
me
This
land
is
worth
400
silver
shekels
but
what
is
that
between
me
and
you
So
bury
your
dead
16
Abraham
listened
to
Ephron
and
Abraham
weighed
out
to
Ephron
the
amount
of
silver
that
he
had
mentioned
in
the
hearing
of
the
sons
of
Heth
400
silver
shekels
according
to
the
weight
accepted
by
the
merchants
17
Thus
the
field
of
Ephron
in
Machpelah
which
was
in
front
of
Mamre—the
field
and
the
cave
in
it
and
all
the
trees
within
the
boundaries
of
the
field—became
confirmed
as
18
Abrahams
purchased
property
in
the
presence
of
the
sons
of
Heth
before
all
those
entering
the
gate
of
his
city
19
After
that
Abraham
buried
his
wife
Sarah
in
the
cave
of
the
field
of
Machpelah
in
front
of
Mamre
that
is
Hebron
in
the
land
of
Canaan
20
Thus
the
field
and
the
cave
that
was
in
it
were
transferred
by
the
sons
of
Heth
to
Abraham
as
property
for
a
burial
place
1
Abraham
was
now
old
advanced
in
years
and
Jehovah
had
blessed
Abraham
in
everything
2
Abraham
said
to
his
servant
the
oldest
one
of
his
household
who
was
managing
all
he
had
Please
put
your
hand
under
my
thigh
3
and
I
will
make
you
swear
by
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
heavens
and
the
God
of
the
earth
that
you
will
not
take
a
wife
for
my
son
from
the
daughters
of
the
Canaanites
among
whom
I
am
dwelling
4
You
must
go
instead
to
my
country
and
to
my
relatives
and
take
a
wife
for
my
son
for
Isaac
5
However
the
servant
said
to
him
What
if
the
woman
is
not
willing
to
come
with
me
to
this
land
Must
I
then
return
your
son
to
the
land
from
which
you
came
6
At
this
Abraham
said
to
him
See
that
you
do
not
take
my
son
there
7
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
heavens
who
took
me
from
my
fathers
house
and
from
the
land
of
my
relatives
and
who
spoke
with
me
and
swore
to
me
To
your
offspring
I
am
going
to
give
this
land

he
will
send
his
angel
ahead
of
you
and
you
will
certainly
take
a
wife
for
my
son
from
there
8
But
if
the
woman
is
unwilling
to
come
with
you
you
will
be
free
from
this
oath
But
you
must
not
take
my
son
there
9
With
that
the
servant
put
his
hand
under
the
thigh
of
Abraham
his
master
and
swore
to
him
concerning
this
matter
10
So
the
servant
took
ten
of
his
masters
camels
and
departed
taking
along
all
sorts
of
good
things
from
his
master
Then
he
went
on
his
way
to
Mesopotamia
to
the
city
of
Nahor
11
He
had
the
camels
kneel
down
at
a
well
of
water
outside
the
city
It
was
about
evening
the
time
when
the
women
would
go
out
to
draw
water
12
Then
he
said
Jehovah
the
God
of
my
master
Abraham
please
grant
me
success
this
day
and
show
your
loyal
love
to
my
master
Abraham
13
Here
I
am
standing
at
a
spring
of
water
and
the
daughters
of
the
men
of
the
city
are
coming
out
to
draw
water
14
May
it
happen
that
the
young
woman
to
whom
I
say
Please
let
down
your
water
jar
so
that
I
may
take
a
drink

and
who
replies
Take
a
drink
and
I
will
also
water
your
camels

let
this
be
the
one
you
choose
for
your
servant
Isaac
and
by
this
let
me
know
that
you
have
shown
your
loyal
love
to
my
master
15
Even
before
he
finished
speaking
Rebekah
who
was
the
daughter
of
Bethuel
the
son
of
Milcah
the
wife
of
Nahor
Abrahams
brother
came
out
with
her
water
jar
on
her
shoulder
16
Now
the
young
woman
was
very
beautiful
a
virgin
no
man
had
had
sexual
relations
with
her
She
went
down
to
the
spring
filled
her
water
jar
and
then
came
back
up
17
At
once
the
servant
ran
to
meet
her
and
said
Please
give
me
a
little
sip
of
water
from
your
jar
18
In
turn
she
said
Drink
my
lord
With
that
she
quickly
lowered
her
jar
upon
her
hand
and
gave
him
a
drink
19
When
she
finished
giving
him
a
drink
she
said
I
will
also
draw
water
for
your
camels
until
they
are
done
drinking
20
So
she
quickly
emptied
her
jar
into
the
drinking
trough
and
ran
again
and
again
to
the
well
to
draw
water
and
she
kept
drawing
water
for
all
his
camels
21
The
whole
time
the
man
silently
stared
at
her
in
amazement
wondering
whether
Jehovah
had
made
his
trip
successful
or
not
22
When
the
camels
had
finished
drinking
the
man
took
out
for
her
a
gold
nose
ring
weighing
a
half
shekel
and
two
bracelets
of
gold
weighing
ten
shekels
23
and
he
said
Please
tell
me
whose
daughter
are
you
Is
there
any
room
at
your
fathers
house
for
us
to
spend
the
night
24
At
that
she
said
to
him
I
am
the
daughter
of
Bethuel
the
son
of
Milcah
whom
she
bore
to
Nahor
25
And
she
added
We
have
both
straw
and
much
fodder
and
also
a
place
to
spend
the
night
26
Then
the
man
bowed
down
and
prostrated
himself
before
Jehovah
27
and
said
May
Jehovah
be
praised
the
God
of
my
master
Abraham
for
he
has
not
abandoned
his
loyal
love
and
his
faithfulness
toward
my
master
Jehovah
has
guided
me
to
the
house
of
the
brothers
of
my
master
28
And
the
young
woman
ran
to
tell
her
mothers
household
about
these
things
29
Now
Rebekah
had
a
brother
whose
name
was
Laban
So
Laban
ran
to
the
man
who
was
outside
at
the
spring
30
When
he
saw
the
nose
ring
and
the
bracelets
on
the
hands
of
his
sister
and
heard
the
words
of
his
sister
Rebekah
who
was
saying
This
is
the
way
the
man
spoke
to
me

he
came
to
meet
the
man
who
was
still
there
standing
by
the
camels
at
the
spring
31
At
once
he
said
Come
you
who
are
blessed
by
Jehovah
Why
do
you
keep
standing
out
here
I
have
made
the
house
ready
and
a
place
for
the
camels
32
With
that
the
man
came
into
the
house
and
he
unharnessed
the
camels
and
gave
straw
and
fodder
to
the
camels
and
water
to
wash
his
feet
and
the
feet
of
the
men
who
were
with
him
33
However
when
something
to
eat
was
set
before
him
he
said
I
will
not
eat
until
I
have
told
you
what
I
have
to
say
So
Laban
said
Speak
34
Then
he
said
I
am
Abrahams
servant
35
And
Jehovah
has
blessed
my
master
very
much
and
he
has
made
him
very
wealthy
by
giving
him
sheep
and
cattle
silver
and
gold
male
and
female
servants
and
camels
and
donkeys
36
Further
Sarah
the
wife
of
my
master
bore
a
son
to
my
master
after
she
grew
old
and
he
will
give
him
everything
he
has
37
So
my
master
made
me
swear
saying
You
must
not
take
a
wife
for
my
son
from
the
daughters
of
the
Canaanites
in
whose
land
I
am
dwelling
38
No
but
you
will
go
to
the
house
of
my
father
and
to
my
family
and
you
must
take
a
wife
for
my
son
39
But
I
said
to
my
master
What
if
the
woman
is
unwilling
to
come
with
me
40
He
said
to
me
Jehovah
before
whom
I
have
walked
will
send
his
angel
with
you
and
will
certainly
give
success
to
your
journey
and
you
must
take
a
wife
for
my
son
from
my
family
and
from
the
house
of
my
father
41
You
will
be
released
from
your
oath
to
me
if
you
go
to
my
family
and
they
will
not
give
her
to
you
This
will
release
you
from
your
oath
42
When
I
got
to
the
spring
today
I
said
Jehovah
the
God
of
my
master
Abraham
if
you
will
make
my
journey
successful
43
here
I
am
standing
at
a
spring
What
must
take
place
is
that
when
a
young
woman
comes
out
to
draw
water
I
will
say
Please
let
me
drink
a
little
water
from
your
jar

44
and
she
will
say
to
me
You
take
a
drink
and
I
will
also
draw
water
for
your
camels
Let
that
woman
be
the
one
whom
Jehovah
has
chosen
for
the
son
of
my
master
45
Before
I
was
finished
speaking
in
my
heart
there
was
Rebekah
coming
out
with
her
jar
on
her
shoulder
and
she
made
her
way
down
to
the
spring
and
began
to
draw
water
Then
I
said
to
her
Give
me
a
drink
please
46
So
she
quickly
lowered
her
jar
from
her
shoulder
and
said
Take
a
drink
and
I
will
also
water
your
camels
Then
I
took
a
drink
and
she
also
watered
the
camels
47
After
that
I
asked
her
Whose
daughter
are
you
to
which
she
replied
The
daughter
of
Bethuel
the
son
of
Nahor
whom
Milcah
bore
to
him
So
I
put
the
ring
on
her
nose
and
the
bracelets
on
her
hands
48
And
I
bowed
down
and
prostrated
myself
before
Jehovah
and
praised
Jehovah
the
God
of
my
master
Abraham
who
had
led
me
on
the
right
path
to
take
the
daughter
of
the
brother
of
my
master
for
his
son
49
And
now
tell
me
if
you
wish
to
show
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
toward
my
master
but
if
not
tell
me
so
that
I
may
proceed
one
way
or
the
other
50
Then
Laban
and
Bethuel
answered
This
is
from
Jehovah
We
are
not
able
to
say
yes
or
no
to
you
51
Here
is
Rebekah
before
you
Take
her
and
go
and
let
her
become
a
wife
to
the
son
of
your
master
just
as
Jehovah
has
spoken
52
When
Abrahams
servant
heard
their
words
he
at
once
bowed
down
on
the
ground
before
Jehovah
53
And
the
servant
began
to
bring
out
articles
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
garments
and
to
give
them
to
Rebekah
and
he
gave
valuable
things
to
her
brother
and
to
her
mother
54
After
that
he
and
the
men
with
him
ate
and
drank
and
they
spent
the
night
there
When
he
got
up
in
the
morning
he
said
Send
me
off
to
my
master
55
To
this
her
brother
and
her
mother
said
Let
the
young
woman
stay
with
us
at
least
ten
days
Then
she
can
go
56
But
he
said
to
them
Do
not
detain
me
seeing
that
Jehovah
has
made
my
journey
successful
Send
me
off
in
order
that
I
may
go
to
my
master
57
So
they
said
Let
us
call
the
young
woman
and
inquire
of
her
58
They
called
Rebekah
and
said
to
her
Will
you
go
with
this
man
She
replied
I
am
willing
to
go
59
So
they
sent
off
their
sister
Rebekah
and
her
nurse
and
Abrahams
servant
and
his
men
60
And
they
blessed
Rebekah
and
said
to
her
Our
sister
may
you
become
thousands
times
ten
thousand
and
let
your
offspring
take
possession
of
the
gate
of
those
who
hate
them
61
Then
Rebekah
and
her
female
attendants
rose
got
on
the
camels
and
followed
the
man
So
the
servant
took
Rebekah
and
went
on
his
way
62
Now
Isaac
had
come
from
the
direction
of
Beer-lahai-roi
for
he
was
dwelling
in
the
land
of
the
Negeb
63
And
Isaac
was
out
walking
in
the
field
about
nightfall
to
meditate
When
he
looked
up
why
he
saw
that
camels
were
coming
64
When
Rebekah
looked
up
she
caught
sight
of
Isaac
and
she
quickly
got
down
from
the
camel
65
Then
she
asked
the
servant
Who
is
that
man
there
walking
in
the
field
to
meet
us
And
the
servant
said
It
is
my
master
So
she
took
her
veil
to
cover
herself
66
And
the
servant
told
Isaac
all
the
things
he
had
done
67
After
that
Isaac
brought
her
into
the
tent
of
Sarah
his
mother
Thus
he
took
Rebekah
as
his
wife
and
he
fell
in
love
with
her
and
Isaac
found
comfort
after
the
loss
of
his
mother
1
Now
Abraham
again
took
a
wife
and
her
name
was
Keturah
2
In
time
she
bore
him
Zimran
Jokshan
Medan
Midian
Ishbak
and
Shuah
3
Jokshan
became
father
to
Sheba
and
Dedan
The
sons
of
Dedan
were
Asshurim
Letushim
and
Leummim
4
The
sons
of
Midian
were
Ephah
Epher
Hanoch
Abida
and
Eldaah
All
of
these
were
the
sons
of
Keturah
5
Later
on
Abraham
gave
everything
he
had
to
Isaac
6
but
Abraham
gave
gifts
to
his
sons
by
his
concubines
Then
while
he
was
still
alive
he
sent
them
eastward
away
from
Isaac
his
son
to
the
land
of
the
East
7
The
years
of
Abrahams
life
were
175
years
8
Then
Abraham
breathed
his
last
and
died
at
a
good
old
age
old
and
satisfied
and
was
gathered
to
his
people
9
His
sons
Isaac
and
Ishmael
buried
him
in
the
cave
of
Machpelah
in
the
field
of
Ephron
the
son
of
Zohar
the
Hittite
that
is
in
front
of
Mamre
10
the
field
that
Abraham
had
purchased
from
the
sons
of
Heth
There
Abraham
was
buried
with
his
wife
Sarah
11
After
Abrahams
death
God
continued
to
bless
his
son
Isaac
and
Isaac
was
dwelling
near
Beer-lahai-roi
12
This
is
the
history
of
Ishmael
the
son
of
Abraham
whom
Hagar
the
Egyptian
the
servant
of
Sarah
bore
to
Abraham
13
Now
these
are
the
names
of
the
sons
of
Ishmael
by
their
names
according
to
their
family
origins
Ishmaels
firstborn
Nebaioth
then
Kedar
Adbeel
Mibsam
14
Mishma
Dumah
Massa
15
Hadad
Tema
Jetur
Naphish
and
Kedemah
16
These
are
the
sons
of
Ishmael
and
these
are
their
names
by
their
settlements
and
by
their
encampments
12
chieftains
according
to
their
clans
17
And
Ishmael
lived
for
137
years
Then
he
breathed
his
last
and
died
and
was
gathered
to
his
people
18
And
they
took
up
dwelling
from
Havilah
near
Shur
which
is
close
to
Egypt
as
far
as
Assyria
He
settled
near
all
his
brothers
19
And
this
is
the
history
of
Isaac
the
son
of
Abraham
Abraham
became
father
to
Isaac
20
Isaac
was
40
years
old
when
he
married
Rebekah
the
daughter
of
Bethuel
the
Aramaean
of
Paddan-aram
the
sister
of
Laban
the
Aramaean
21
And
Isaac
kept
pleading
with
Jehovah
regarding
his
wife
because
she
was
barren
so
Jehovah
responded
to
his
plea
and
his
wife
Rebekah
became
pregnant
22
And
the
sons
within
her
began
to
struggle
with
each
other
so
that
she
said
If
this
is
the
way
it
is
why
should
I
go
on
living
So
she
inquired
of
Jehovah
23
And
Jehovah
said
to
her
Two
nations
are
in
your
womb
and
two
peoples
will
be
separated
from
within
you
and
the
one
nation
will
be
stronger
than
the
other
nation
and
the
older
will
serve
the
younger
24
When
the
time
came
for
her
to
give
birth
look
twins
were
in
her
womb
25
Then
the
first
came
out
red
all
over
and
was
like
a
garment
of
hair
so
they
named
him
Esau
26
After
that
his
brother
came
out
and
his
hand
was
holding
onto
the
heel
of
Esau
so
he
named
him
Jacob
Isaac
was
60
years
old
when
she
gave
birth
to
them
27
As
the
boys
got
bigger
Esau
became
a
skilled
hunter
a
man
of
the
field
but
Jacob
was
a
blameless
man
dwelling
in
tents
28
And
Isaac
loved
Esau
because
it
meant
game
in
his
mouth
whereas
Rebekah
loved
Jacob
29
On
one
occasion
Jacob
was
boiling
some
stew
when
Esau
returned
from
the
field
exhausted
30
So
Esau
said
to
Jacob
Quick
please
give
me
some
of
the
red
stew
that
you
have
there
for
I
am
exhausted
That
is
why
his
name
was
Edom
31
To
this
Jacob
said
First
sell
me
your
right
as
firstborn
32
And
Esau
continued
Here
I
am
about
to
die
What
use
is
a
birthright
to
me
33
And
Jacob
added
Swear
to
me
first
So
he
swore
to
him
and
sold
his
right
as
firstborn
to
Jacob
34
Then
Jacob
gave
Esau
bread
and
lentil
stew
and
he
ate
and
drank
and
he
got
up
and
went
away
Thus
Esau
despised
the
birthright
1
Now
there
was
a
famine
in
the
land
in
addition
to
the
first
famine
that
occurred
in
the
days
of
Abraham
so
that
Isaac
went
to
Abimelech
king
of
the
Philistines
in
Gerar
2
Then
Jehovah
appeared
to
him
and
said
Do
not
go
down
to
Egypt
Dwell
in
the
land
that
I
designate
to
you
3
Reside
as
a
foreigner
in
this
land
and
I
will
continue
with
you
and
bless
you
because
to
you
and
to
your
offspring
I
will
give
all
these
lands
and
I
will
carry
out
the
oath
that
I
swore
to
your
father
Abraham
4
I
will
multiply
your
offspring
like
the
stars
of
the
heavens
and
I
will
give
to
your
offspring
all
these
lands
and
by
means
of
your
offspring
all
nations
of
the
earth
will
obtain
a
blessing
for
themselves

5
on
account
of
the
fact
that
Abraham
listened
to
my
voice
and
continued
to
keep
my
requirements
my
commands
my
statutes
and
my
laws
6
So
Isaac
continued
to
dwell
in
Gerar
7
When
the
men
of
the
place
kept
asking
about
his
wife
he
would
say
She
is
my
sister
He
was
afraid
to
say
She
is
my
wife

for
he
said
The
men
of
the
place
might
kill
me
because
of
Rebekah

for
she
was
beautiful
in
appearance
8
After
some
time
had
passed
Abimelech
king
of
the
Philistines
was
looking
out
of
the
window
and
he
saw
Isaac
displaying
affection
for
Rebekah
his
wife
9
At
once
Abimelech
called
Isaac
and
said
She
is
actually
your
wife
Why
did
you
say
She
is
my
sister
At
this
Isaac
said
to
him
I
said
it
for
fear
I
should
die
because
of
her
10
But
Abimelech
continued
What
have
you
done
to
us
One
of
the
people
could
easily
have
lain
down
with
your
wife
and
you
would
have
brought
guilt
upon
us
11
Then
Abimelech
commanded
all
the
people
saying
Anybody
touching
this
man
and
his
wife
will
surely
be
put
to
death
12
And
Isaac
began
to
sow
seed
in
that
land
and
in
that
year
he
reaped
100
times
what
he
sowed
for
Jehovah
was
blessing
him
13
The
man
became
wealthy
and
he
continued
to
prosper
until
he
became
very
wealthy
14
He
acquired
flocks
of
sheep
and
herds
of
cattle
and
a
large
body
of
servants
and
the
Philistines
began
to
envy
him
15
So
the
Philistines
took
soil
and
stopped
up
all
the
wells
that
his
fathers
servants
had
dug
in
the
days
of
Abraham
16
Abimelech
then
said
to
Isaac
Move
from
our
neighborhood
for
you
have
grown
far
stronger
than
we
are
17
So
Isaac
moved
from
there
and
encamped
in
the
valley
of
Gerar
and
began
dwelling
there
18
And
Isaac
again
dug
the
wells
that
had
been
dug
in
the
days
of
his
father
Abraham
but
that
the
Philistines
had
stopped
up
after
Abrahams
death
and
he
called
them
by
the
names
that
his
father
had
given
them
19
When
the
servants
of
Isaac
were
digging
in
the
valley
they
found
a
well
of
fresh
water
20
And
the
shepherds
of
Gerar
began
quarreling
with
the
shepherds
of
Isaac
saying
The
water
is
ours
So
he
named
the
well
Esek
because
they
had
quarreled
with
him
21
And
they
started
digging
another
well
and
they
began
quarreling
over
it
also
So
he
named
it
Sitnah
22
Later
he
moved
away
from
there
and
dug
another
well
but
they
did
not
quarrel
over
it
So
he
named
it
Rehoboth
and
said
It
is
because
now
Jehovah
has
given
us
ample
room
and
has
made
us
fruitful
in
the
land
23
Then
he
went
up
from
there
to
Beer-sheba
24
That
night
Jehovah
appeared
to
him
and
said
I
am
the
God
of
your
father
Abraham
Do
not
be
afraid
for
I
am
with
you
and
I
will
bless
you
and
multiply
your
offspring
on
account
of
Abraham
my
servant
25
So
he
built
an
altar
there
and
called
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
And
Isaac
pitched
his
tent
there
and
his
servants
dug
a
well
there
26
Later
Abimelech
came
to
him
from
Gerar
with
Ahuzzath
his
personal
adviser
and
Phicol
the
chief
of
his
army
27
At
this
Isaac
said
to
them
Why
have
you
come
to
me
seeing
that
you
hated
me
and
sent
me
away
from
your
neighborhood
28
To
this
they
said
We
have
clearly
seen
that
Jehovah
has
been
with
you
So
we
said
Let
there
please
be
an
oath
of
obligation
between
us
and
you
and
let
us
make
a
covenant
with
you
29
that
you
will
do
nothing
bad
to
us
just
as
we
have
not
harmed
you
seeing
that
we
have
done
only
good
to
you
in
that
we
sent
you
away
in
peace
You
now
are
the
blessed
of
Jehovah
30
Then
he
made
a
feast
for
them
and
they
ate
and
drank
31
In
the
morning
they
got
up
early
and
swore
an
oath
to
each
other
After
that
Isaac
sent
them
away
and
they
went
from
him
in
peace
32
On
that
day
the
servants
of
Isaac
came
and
reported
to
him
about
the
well
that
they
had
dug
and
they
told
him
We
have
found
water
33
So
he
named
it
Shibah
That
is
why
the
name
of
the
city
is
Beer-sheba
to
this
day
34
When
Esau
was
40
years
old
he
took
as
wife
Judith
the
daughter
of
Beeri
the
Hittite
and
also
Basemath
the
daughter
of
Elon
the
Hittite
35
They
were
a
source
of
great
grief
to
Isaac
and
Rebekah
1
Now
when
Isaac
was
old
and
his
eyes
were
too
weak
to
see
he
called
Esau
his
older
son
to
him
and
said
My
son
He
replied
Here
I
am
2
And
he
went
on
to
say
I
have
now
grown
old
I
do
not
know
the
day
of
my
death
3
So
at
this
time
take
please
your
weapons
your
quiver
and
your
bow
and
go
out
to
the
field
and
hunt
some
wild
game
for
me
4
Then
make
the
kind
of
tasty
dish
that
I
am
fond
of
and
bring
it
to
me
Then
I
will
eat
it
so
that
I
may
bless
you
before
I
die
5
However
Rebekah
was
listening
while
Isaac
spoke
to
Esau
his
son
And
Esau
went
out
into
the
field
to
hunt
game
and
to
bring
it
in
6
And
Rebekah
said
to
Jacob
her
son
I
just
heard
your
father
speaking
to
your
brother
Esau
saying
7
Bring
me
some
game
and
make
me
a
tasty
dish
Then
let
me
eat
so
that
I
may
bless
you
before
Jehovah
before
my
death
8
And
now
my
son
listen
carefully
and
do
what
I
am
instructing
you
9
Go
please
to
the
herd
and
get
me
two
of
the
best
young
goats
from
there
so
that
I
may
prepare
from
them
a
tasty
dish
for
your
father
just
the
way
he
likes
it
10
Then
take
it
to
your
father
to
eat
in
order
that
he
may
bless
you
before
his
death
11
Jacob
said
to
his
mother
Rebekah
But
Esau
my
brother
is
a
hairy
man
and
my
skin
is
smooth
12
What
if
my
father
feels
me
Then
I
will
certainly
appear
to
be
mocking
him
and
I
will
bring
upon
myself
a
curse
rather
than
a
blessing
13
At
this
his
mother
said
to
him
Upon
me
be
the
curse
meant
for
you
my
son
Just
do
as
I
say
and
go
get
them
for
me
14
So
he
went
and
got
them
and
brought
them
to
his
mother
and
his
mother
made
a
tasty
dish
just
the
way
his
father
liked
it
15
After
that
Rebekah
took
her
older
son
Esaus
finest
garments
which
she
had
in
the
house
and
put
them
on
her
younger
son
Jacob
16
She
also
put
the
skins
of
the
young
goats
on
his
hands
and
on
the
hairless
part
of
his
neck
17
Then
she
handed
the
tasty
dish
and
the
bread
that
she
had
made
to
her
son
Jacob
18
So
he
went
in
to
his
father
and
said
My
father
to
which
he
said
Here
I
am
Who
are
you
my
son
19
Jacob
said
to
his
father
I
am
Esau
your
firstborn
I
have
done
just
as
you
told
me
Sit
up
please
and
eat
some
of
my
game
so
that
you
may
bless
me
20
At
that
Isaac
said
to
his
son
How
were
you
so
quick
in
finding
it
my
son
He
replied
Because
Jehovah
your
God
brought
it
to
me
21
Then
Isaac
said
to
Jacob
Come
near
please
that
I
may
feel
you
my
son
to
know
whether
you
are
really
my
son
Esau
or
not
22
So
Jacob
came
near
to
his
father
Isaac
and
he
felt
him
after
which
he
said
The
voice
is
the
voice
of
Jacob
but
the
hands
are
the
hands
of
Esau
23
He
did
not
recognize
him
because
his
hands
were
hairy
like
the
hands
of
his
brother
Esau
So
he
blessed
him
24
After
that
he
asked
Are
you
really
my
son
Esau
to
which
he
replied
I
am
25
Then
he
said
Bring
me
some
of
the
wild
game
for
me
to
eat
my
son
then
I
will
bless
you
With
that
he
brought
it
to
him
and
he
ate
and
he
brought
him
wine
and
he
drank
26
Then
Isaac
his
father
said
to
him
Come
near
please
and
kiss
me
my
son
27
So
he
came
near
and
kissed
him
and
he
could
smell
the
scent
of
his
garments
Then
he
blessed
him
and
said
See
the
scent
of
my
son
is
like
the
scent
of
the
field
that
Jehovah
has
blessed
28
May
the
true
God
give
you
the
dews
of
the
heavens
and
the
fertile
soils
of
the
earth
and
an
abundance
of
grain
and
new
wine
29
Let
peoples
serve
you
and
let
nations
bow
low
to
you
Be
master
over
your
brothers
and
let
the
sons
of
your
mother
bow
low
to
you
Cursed
be
everyone
who
curses
you
and
blessed
be
everyone
who
blesses
you
30
Now
Isaac
had
just
finished
blessing
Jacob
and
Jacob
had
barely
left
the
presence
of
his
father
Isaac
when
his
brother
Esau
came
back
from
his
hunting
31
He
too
prepared
a
tasty
dish
and
brought
it
to
his
father
and
he
said
to
his
father
Let
my
father
get
up
and
eat
some
of
his
sons
game
in
order
that
you
may
bless
me
32
At
this
his
father
Isaac
said
to
him
Who
are
you
to
which
he
said
I
am
your
son
your
firstborn
Esau
33
And
Isaac
began
to
tremble
violently
so
he
said
Who
was
it
then
who
hunted
for
game
and
brought
it
to
me
I
already
ate
it
before
you
arrived
and
I
blessed
him—and
he
will
surely
be
blessed
34
On
hearing
his
fathers
words
Esau
began
to
cry
out
in
an
extremely
loud
and
bitter
manner
and
to
say
to
his
father
Bless
me
yes
me
too
my
father
35
But
he
said
Your
brother
came
deceitfully
so
that
he
might
get
the
blessing
meant
for
you
36
At
this
he
said
Is
he
not
rightly
named
Jacob
that
he
might
supplant
me
these
two
times
My
birthright
he
has
already
taken
and
now
he
has
taken
my
blessing
Then
he
added
Have
you
not
reserved
a
blessing
for
me
37
But
Isaac
answered
Esau
Here
I
have
appointed
him
master
over
you
and
I
have
given
him
all
his
brothers
as
servants
and
I
have
bestowed
grain
and
new
wine
for
his
support
What
is
left
that
I
can
do
for
you
my
son
38
Esau
said
to
his
father
Is
there
just
one
blessing
that
you
have
my
father
Bless
me
yes
me
too
my
father
With
that
Esau
cried
loudly
and
burst
into
tears
39
So
his
father
Isaac
answered
him
See
away
from
the
fertile
soils
of
the
earth
your
dwelling
will
be
and
away
from
the
dew
of
the
heavens
above
40
And
by
your
sword
you
will
live
and
you
will
serve
your
brother
But
when
you
grow
restless
you
will
indeed
break
his
yoke
off
your
neck
41
However
Esau
harbored
animosity
against
Jacob
because
of
the
blessing
his
father
had
given
him
and
Esau
kept
saying
in
his
heart
The
days
of
mourning
for
my
father
are
getting
closer
After
that
I
am
going
to
kill
Jacob
my
brother
42
When
the
words
of
her
older
son
Esau
were
told
to
Rebekah
she
at
once
sent
for
her
younger
son
Jacob
and
said
to
him
Look
Your
brother
Esau
is
planning
to
take
revenge
by
killing
you
43
Now
my
son
do
as
I
say
Get
up
and
run
away
to
my
brother
Laban
at
Haran
44
Dwell
with
him
for
a
while
until
your
brothers
rage
calms
down
45
until
your
brothers
anger
toward
you
subsides
and
he
forgets
what
you
have
done
to
him
Then
I
will
send
for
you
from
there
Why
should
I
lose
both
of
you
in
one
day
46
After
that
Rebekah
kept
saying
to
Isaac
I
am
disgusted
with
my
life
because
of
the
daughters
of
Heth
If
Jacob
ever
takes
a
wife
from
the
daughters
of
Heth
like
these
daughters
of
the
land
what
good
is
my
life
1
So
Isaac
called
Jacob
and
blessed
him
and
commanded
him
saying
You
must
not
take
a
wife
from
the
daughters
of
Canaan
2
Go
away
to
Paddan-aram
to
the
house
of
Bethuel
your
mothers
father
and
from
there
take
for
yourself
a
wife
from
the
daughters
of
Laban
your
mothers
brother
3
God
Almighty
will
bless
you
and
make
you
fruitful
and
multiply
you
and
you
will
certainly
become
a
congregation
of
peoples
4
And
he
will
give
to
you
the
blessing
of
Abraham
to
you
and
to
your
offspring
with
you
so
that
you
may
take
possession
of
the
land
where
you
have
been
living
as
a
foreigner
which
God
has
given
to
Abraham
5
So
Isaac
sent
Jacob
away
and
he
departed
for
Paddan-aram
to
Laban
the
son
of
Bethuel
the
Aramaean
the
brother
of
Rebekah
the
mother
of
Jacob
and
Esau
6
Esau
saw
that
Isaac
had
blessed
Jacob
and
had
sent
him
away
to
Paddan-aram
to
take
a
wife
from
there
and
that
when
he
blessed
him
he
commanded
him
Do
not
take
a
wife
from
the
daughters
of
Canaan

7
and
that
Jacob
obeyed
his
father
and
his
mother
and
departed
for
Paddan-aram
8
Esau
then
realized
that
the
daughters
of
Canaan
were
displeasing
to
his
father
Isaac
9
so
Esau
went
to
Ishmael
and
took
as
wife
Mahalath
the
daughter
of
Abrahams
son
Ishmael
the
sister
of
Nebaioth
in
addition
to
the
other
wives
he
already
had
10
Jacob
departed
from
Beer-sheba
and
kept
going
toward
Haran
11
In
time
he
came
to
a
place
and
prepared
to
spend
the
night
there
because
the
sun
had
set
So
he
took
one
of
the
stones
of
that
place
and
set
it
to
rest
his
head
on
and
lay
down
there
12
Then
he
had
a
dream
and
look
there
was
a
stairway
set
on
the
earth
and
its
top
reached
up
to
the
heavens
and
there
were
Gods
angels
ascending
and
descending
on
it
13
And
look
there
was
Jehovah
stationed
above
it
and
he
said
I
am
Jehovah
the
God
of
Abraham
your
father
and
the
God
of
Isaac
The
land
on
which
you
are
lying
to
you
I
am
going
to
give
it
and
to
your
offspring
14
And
your
offspring
will
certainly
become
like
the
dust
particles
of
the
earth
and
you
will
spread
abroad
to
the
west
and
to
the
east
and
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
and
by
means
of
you
and
by
means
of
your
offspring
all
the
families
of
the
ground
will
certainly
be
blessed
15
I
am
with
you
and
I
will
safeguard
you
wherever
you
go
and
I
will
return
you
to
this
land
I
will
not
leave
you
until
I
have
done
what
I
have
promised
you
16
Then
Jacob
awoke
from
his
sleep
and
said
Truly
Jehovah
is
in
this
place
and
I
did
not
know
it
17
And
he
grew
fearful
and
added
How
awe-inspiring
this
place
is
This
can
only
be
the
house
of
God
and
this
is
the
gate
of
the
heavens
18
So
Jacob
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
took
the
stone
on
which
he
had
rested
his
head
and
set
it
up
as
a
pillar
and
poured
oil
on
top
of
it
19
So
he
named
that
place
Bethel
but
previously
the
citys
name
was
Luz
20
Jacob
then
made
a
vow
saying
If
God
will
continue
with
me
and
will
protect
me
on
my
journey
and
will
give
me
bread
to
eat
and
garments
to
wear
21
and
I
return
in
peace
to
the
house
of
my
father
then
Jehovah
will
certainly
have
proved
to
be
my
God
22
And
this
stone
that
I
have
set
up
as
a
pillar
will
become
a
house
of
God
and
without
fail
I
will
give
you
a
tenth
of
everything
you
give
to
me
1
After
that
Jacob
resumed
his
journey
and
traveled
on
to
the
land
of
the
people
of
the
East
2
Now
he
saw
a
well
in
the
field
and
three
droves
of
sheep
lying
down
next
to
it
because
they
usually
watered
the
droves
from
that
well
There
was
a
large
stone
over
the
mouth
of
the
well
3
When
all
the
droves
had
been
gathered
there
they
rolled
away
the
stone
from
the
mouth
of
the
well
and
they
watered
the
flocks
after
which
they
returned
the
stone
to
its
place
over
the
mouth
of
the
well
4
So
Jacob
said
to
them
My
brothers
what
place
are
you
from
to
which
they
said
We
are
from
Haran
5
He
said
to
them
Do
you
know
Laban
the
grandson
of
Nahor
to
which
they
said
We
know
him
6
At
this
he
said
to
them
Is
he
well
They
replied
He
is
well
And
here
is
his
daughter
Rachel
coming
with
the
sheep
7
Then
he
said
It
is
still
the
middle
of
the
day
It
is
not
the
time
for
gathering
the
herds
Water
the
sheep
and
then
go
feed
them
8
To
this
they
said
We
are
not
allowed
to
do
so
until
all
the
droves
are
gathered
and
they
roll
the
stone
away
from
the
mouth
of
the
well
Then
we
water
the
sheep
9
While
he
was
yet
speaking
with
them
Rachel
came
with
her
fathers
sheep
for
she
was
a
shepherdess
10
When
Jacob
saw
Rachel
the
daughter
of
Laban
his
mothers
brother
and
the
sheep
of
Laban
Jacob
immediately
approached
and
rolled
the
stone
away
from
the
mouth
of
the
well
and
watered
the
sheep
of
Laban
his
mothers
brother
11
Then
Jacob
kissed
Rachel
and
raised
his
voice
and
burst
into
tears
12
And
Jacob
began
to
tell
Rachel
that
he
was
the
relative
of
her
father
and
that
he
was
the
son
of
Rebekah
And
she
ran
off
and
told
her
father
13
As
soon
as
Laban
heard
the
report
about
Jacob
the
son
of
his
sister
he
ran
to
meet
him
He
embraced
him
and
kissed
him
and
brought
him
into
his
house
And
he
began
to
tell
Laban
all
these
things
14
Laban
said
to
him
You
are
indeed
my
bone
and
my
flesh
So
he
stayed
with
him
a
full
month
15
Laban
then
said
to
Jacob
Just
because
you
are
my
relative
should
you
serve
me
for
nothing
Tell
me
what
are
your
wages
to
be
16
Now
Laban
had
two
daughters
The
name
of
the
older
was
Leah
and
the
name
of
the
younger
Rachel
17
But
the
eyes
of
Leah
had
no
luster
whereas
Rachel
had
become
a
very
attractive
and
beautiful
woman
18
Jacob
had
fallen
in
love
with
Rachel
so
he
said
I
am
willing
to
serve
you
seven
years
for
your
younger
daughter
Rachel
19
To
this
Laban
said
It
is
better
for
me
to
give
her
to
you
than
to
give
her
to
another
man
Keep
dwelling
with
me
20
And
Jacob
served
seven
years
for
Rachel
but
in
his
eyes
they
were
like
just
a
few
days
because
of
his
love
for
her
21
Then
Jacob
said
to
Laban
Give
over
my
wife
because
my
days
are
up
and
let
me
have
relations
with
her
22
With
that
Laban
gathered
all
the
men
of
the
place
and
made
a
feast
23
But
during
the
evening
he
resorted
to
taking
his
daughter
Leah
and
bringing
her
to
him
that
he
might
have
relations
with
her
24
Laban
also
gave
his
female
servant
Zilpah
to
his
daughter
Leah
as
a
servant
25
In
the
morning
Jacob
saw
that
it
was
Leah
So
he
said
to
Laban
What
have
you
done
to
me
Was
it
not
for
Rachel
that
I
served
you
Why
have
you
tricked
me
26
To
this
Laban
said
It
is
not
our
custom
here
to
give
the
younger
woman
before
the
firstborn
27
Celebrate
the
week
of
this
woman
After
that
you
will
also
be
given
this
other
woman
in
exchange
for
serving
me
seven
more
years
28
Jacob
did
so
and
celebrated
the
week
of
this
woman
after
which
he
gave
him
his
daughter
Rachel
as
a
wife
29
Besides
Laban
gave
his
female
servant
Bilhah
to
his
daughter
Rachel
as
her
servant
30
Then
Jacob
had
relations
also
with
Rachel
and
he
loved
Rachel
more
than
Leah
and
he
served
him
for
another
seven
years
31
When
Jehovah
saw
that
Leah
was
unloved
he
then
enabled
her
to
become
pregnant
but
Rachel
was
barren
32
So
Leah
became
pregnant
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
named
him
Reuben
for
she
said
It
is
because
Jehovah
has
looked
upon
my
affliction
for
now
my
husband
will
begin
to
love
me
33
And
she
again
became
pregnant
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
then
said
It
is
because
Jehovah
has
listened
in
that
I
was
unloved
so
he
gave
me
this
one
also
Then
she
named
him
Simeon
34
And
she
became
pregnant
yet
again
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
then
said
Now
this
time
my
husband
will
join
himself
to
me
because
I
have
borne
him
three
sons
Therefore
he
was
named
Levi
35
And
she
became
pregnant
once
more
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
then
said
This
time
I
will
praise
Jehovah
She
therefore
named
him
Judah
After
that
she
stopped
giving
birth
1
When
Rachel
saw
that
she
had
borne
no
children
to
Jacob
she
became
jealous
of
her
sister
and
began
to
say
to
Jacob
Give
me
children
or
else
I
will
die
2
At
this
Jacobs
anger
flared
up
against
Rachel
and
he
said
Am
I
in
the
place
of
God
who
has
prevented
you
from
having
children
3
So
she
said
Here
is
my
slave
girl
Bilhah
Have
relations
with
her
in
order
that
she
may
bear
children
for
me
and
that
through
her
I
too
may
have
children
4
With
that
she
gave
him
her
servant
Bilhah
as
a
wife
and
Jacob
had
relations
with
her
5
Bilhah
became
pregnant
and
in
time
bore
Jacob
a
son
6
Then
Rachel
said
God
has
acted
as
my
judge
and
has
also
listened
to
my
voice
so
that
he
gave
me
a
son
That
is
why
she
named
him
Dan
7
Bilhah
Rachels
servant
became
pregnant
once
more
and
in
time
bore
Jacob
a
second
son
8
Then
Rachel
said
With
strenuous
wrestlings
I
have
wrestled
with
my
sister
I
have
also
come
off
the
winner
So
she
named
him
Naphtali
9
When
Leah
saw
that
she
had
stopped
having
children
she
took
her
servant
Zilpah
and
gave
her
to
Jacob
as
a
wife
10
And
Leahs
servant
Zilpah
bore
a
son
to
Jacob
11
Then
Leah
said
With
good
fortune
So
she
named
him
Gad
12
After
that
Zilpah
Leahs
servant
bore
a
second
son
to
Jacob
13
Then
Leah
said
With
my
happiness
For
the
daughters
will
certainly
pronounce
me
happy
So
she
named
him
Asher
14
Now
Reuben
was
walking
in
the
days
of
the
wheat
harvest
and
he
found
mandrakes
in
the
field
So
he
brought
them
to
his
mother
Leah
Then
Rachel
said
to
Leah
Give
me
please
some
of
your
sons
mandrakes
15
At
this
she
said
to
her
Is
it
a
small
matter
that
you
took
my
husband
Would
you
now
take
my
sons
mandrakes
also
So
Rachel
said
Very
well
He
will
lie
down
with
you
tonight
in
exchange
for
your
sons
mandrakes
16
When
Jacob
was
coming
from
the
field
in
the
evening
Leah
went
out
to
meet
him
and
said
It
is
with
me
you
are
going
to
have
relations
because
I
have
hired
you
outright
with
my
sons
mandrakes
So
he
lay
down
with
her
that
night
17
And
God
heard
and
answered
Leah
and
she
became
pregnant
and
in
time
bore
to
Jacob
a
fifth
son
18
Then
Leah
said
God
has
given
me
my
wages
because
I
have
given
my
servant
to
my
husband
So
she
named
him
Issachar
19
And
Leah
became
pregnant
once
more
and
in
time
bore
a
sixth
son
to
Jacob
20
Then
Leah
said
God
has
endowed
me
yes
me
with
a
good
endowment
At
last
my
husband
will
tolerate
me
for
I
have
borne
him
six
sons
So
she
named
him
Zebulun
21
Afterward
she
bore
a
daughter
and
named
her
Dinah
22
Finally
God
remembered
Rachel
and
God
heard
and
answered
her
by
enabling
her
to
become
pregnant
23
And
she
became
pregnant
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
Then
she
said
God
has
taken
away
my
reproach
24
So
she
named
him
Joseph
saying
Jehovah
is
adding
another
son
to
me
25
After
Rachel
had
given
birth
to
Joseph
Jacob
immediately
said
to
Laban
Send
me
away
so
that
I
may
go
to
my
place
and
to
my
land
26
Give
over
my
wives
and
my
children
for
whom
I
have
served
with
you
that
I
may
go
for
you
well
know
how
I
have
served
you
27
Then
Laban
said
to
him
If
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
—I
have
understood
by
the
omens
that
Jehovah
is
blessing
me
because
of
you
28
And
he
added
Stipulate
your
wages
to
me
and
I
will
give
them
29
So
Jacob
said
to
him
You
know
how
I
have
served
you
and
how
your
herd
has
fared
with
me
30
you
had
little
before
my
coming
but
your
herd
has
increased
and
multiplied
and
Jehovah
has
blessed
you
since
I
arrived
So
when
will
I
do
something
for
my
own
house
31
Then
he
said
What
should
I
give
you
And
Jacob
said
You
will
give
me
nothing
whatsoever
If
you
will
do
this
one
thing
for
me
I
will
resume
shepherding
your
flock
and
guarding
it
32
I
will
pass
through
your
whole
flock
today
You
set
aside
from
there
every
sheep
speckled
and
with
color
patches
and
every
dark-brown
sheep
among
the
young
rams
and
any
color-patched
and
speckled
one
among
the
she-goats
From
now
on
these
must
become
my
wages
33
And
my
righteousness
must
speak
for
me
on
a
future
day
when
you
come
to
look
over
my
wages
every
one
that
is
not
speckled
and
color-patched
among
the
she-goats
and
dark
brown
among
the
young
rams
will
be
considered
stolen
if
it
is
with
me
34
To
this
Laban
said
That
is
fine
Let
it
be
according
to
your
word
35
Then
on
that
day
he
set
aside
the
he-goats
striped
and
color-patched
and
all
the
she-goats
speckled
and
color-patched
every
one
in
which
there
was
any
white
and
every
one
dark
brown
among
the
young
rams
and
gave
them
into
the
care
of
his
sons
36
After
that
he
set
a
distance
of
three
days
journey
between
himself
and
Jacob
and
Jacob
was
shepherding
the
flocks
of
Laban
that
remained
over
37
Jacob
then
took
freshly
cut
staffs
of
the
storax
almond
and
plane
trees
and
he
peeled
white
spots
in
them
by
exposing
the
white
wood
of
the
staffs
38
Then
he
placed
the
staffs
that
he
had
peeled
in
front
of
the
flock
in
the
gutters
in
the
drinking
troughs
where
the
flocks
would
come
to
drink
that
they
might
get
into
heat
in
front
of
them
when
they
came
to
drink
39
So
the
flocks
would
get
into
heat
in
front
of
the
staffs
and
the
flocks
would
produce
striped
speckled
and
color-patched
offspring
40
Then
Jacob
separated
the
young
rams
and
turned
the
flocks
to
face
the
striped
ones
and
all
the
dark-brown
ones
among
the
flocks
of
Laban
Then
he
separated
his
own
flocks
and
did
not
mix
them
with
Labans
flocks
41
And
whenever
the
robust
animals
would
get
into
heat
Jacob
would
place
the
staffs
in
the
gutters
before
the
eyes
of
the
flocks
that
they
might
get
into
heat
by
the
staffs
42
But
when
the
animals
were
weak
he
would
not
place
the
staffs
there
So
the
weak
ones
always
came
to
be
Labans
but
the
robust
ones
became
Jacobs
43
And
the
man
grew
very
prosperous
and
he
acquired
great
flocks
and
male
and
female
servants
and
camels
and
donkeys
1
In
time
he
heard
what
the
sons
of
Laban
were
saying
Jacob
has
taken
everything
that
belonged
to
our
father
and
from
what
belonged
to
our
father
he
has
amassed
all
this
wealth
2
When
Jacob
would
look
at
the
face
of
Laban
he
saw
that
his
attitude
toward
him
was
not
what
it
used
to
be
3
Finally
Jehovah
said
to
Jacob
Return
to
the
land
of
your
fathers
and
to
your
relatives
and
I
will
continue
with
you
4
Then
Jacob
sent
a
message
to
Rachel
and
Leah
to
come
out
to
the
field
to
his
flock
5
and
he
said
to
them
I
have
seen
that
your
fathers
attitude
toward
me
has
changed
but
the
God
of
my
father
has
been
with
me
6
You
yourselves
certainly
know
that
I
have
served
your
father
with
all
my
power
7
And
your
father
has
tried
to
cheat
me
and
has
changed
my
wages
ten
times
but
God
has
not
allowed
him
to
do
me
harm
8
If
on
the
one
hand
he
would
say
The
speckled
ones
will
be
your
wages

then
the
whole
flock
produced
speckled
ones
but
if
on
the
other
hand
he
would
say
The
striped
ones
will
be
your
wages

then
the
whole
flock
produced
striped
ones
9
So
God
kept
taking
your
fathers
livestock
away
from
him
and
giving
it
to
me
10
Once
when
the
flock
got
into
heat
I
raised
my
eyes
and
saw
in
a
dream
that
the
he-goats
mating
with
the
flock
were
striped
speckled
and
spotty
11
Then
the
angel
of
the
true
God
said
to
me
in
the
dream
Jacob
to
which
I
said
Here
I
am
12
And
he
continued
Raise
your
eyes
please
and
see
that
all
the
he-goats
mating
with
the
flock
are
striped
speckled
and
spotty
for
I
have
seen
all
that
Laban
is
doing
to
you
13
I
am
the
true
God
of
Bethel
where
you
anointed
a
pillar
and
where
you
made
a
vow
to
me
Now
get
up
go
out
of
this
land
and
return
to
the
land
of
your
birth
14
At
this
Rachel
and
Leah
answered
him
Is
there
any
share
left
for
us
to
inherit
in
our
fathers
house
15
Does
he
not
consider
us
as
foreigners
since
he
has
sold
us
and
has
been
using
up
the
money
given
for
us
16
All
the
riches
that
God
has
taken
away
from
our
father
are
ours
and
our
childrens
So
then
do
everything
that
God
has
told
you
to
do
17
Then
Jacob
got
up
and
lifted
his
children
and
his
wives
on
the
camels
18
and
he
began
driving
all
his
herd
and
all
the
goods
that
he
had
accumulated
the
livestock
in
his
possession
that
he
had
accumulated
in
Paddan-aram
to
go
to
Isaac
his
father
in
the
land
of
Canaan
19
Now
Laban
had
gone
to
shear
his
sheep
and
Rachel
stole
the
teraphim
statues
that
belonged
to
her
father
20
Moreover
Jacob
outwitted
Laban
the
Aramaean
for
he
had
not
told
him
that
he
was
running
away
21
And
he
ran
away
and
crossed
the
River
he
and
all
he
had
Then
he
headed
toward
the
mountainous
region
of
Gilead
22
On
the
third
day
Laban
was
told
that
Jacob
had
run
away
23
So
he
took
his
brothers
with
him
and
pursued
him
for
a
journey
of
seven
days
and
caught
up
with
him
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Gilead
24
Then
God
came
to
Laban
the
Aramaean
in
a
dream
by
night
and
said
to
him
Be
careful
about
what
you
say
to
Jacob
either
good
or
bad
25
So
Laban
approached
Jacob
as
Jacob
had
pitched
his
tent
in
the
mountain
and
Laban
had
encamped
with
his
brothers
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Gilead
26
Then
Laban
said
to
Jacob
What
have
you
done
Why
have
you
resorted
to
outwitting
me
and
carrying
my
daughters
off
like
captives
taken
by
the
sword
27
Why
did
you
run
away
secretly
and
outwit
me
and
not
tell
me
If
you
had
told
me
I
could
have
sent
you
away
with
rejoicing
and
with
songs
with
tambourine
and
with
harp
28
But
you
did
not
give
me
a
chance
to
kiss
my
grandchildren
and
my
daughters
You
have
acted
foolishly
29
It
is
in
my
power
to
do
harm
to
you
but
the
God
of
your
father
spoke
to
me
last
night
saying
Be
careful
about
what
you
say
to
Jacob
either
good
or
bad
30
Now
you
have
gone
because
you
have
been
longing
to
return
to
the
house
of
your
father
but
why
have
you
stolen
my
gods
31
Jacob
answered
Laban
It
was
because
I
was
afraid
for
I
said
to
myself
You
might
take
your
daughters
away
from
me
by
force
32
Anyone
with
whom
you
find
your
gods
will
not
live
Before
our
brothers
examine
what
I
have
and
take
what
is
yours
But
Jacob
did
not
know
that
Rachel
had
stolen
them
33
So
Laban
went
into
the
tent
of
Jacob
and
into
the
tent
of
Leah
and
into
the
tent
of
the
two
slave
girls
but
did
not
find
them
Then
he
came
out
of
Leahs
tent
and
went
into
Rachels
tent
34
Meanwhile
Rachel
had
taken
the
teraphim
statues
and
put
them
in
the
womans
saddle
basket
of
the
camel
and
she
was
sitting
on
them
So
Laban
searched
through
the
whole
tent
but
did
not
find
them
35
Then
she
said
to
her
father
Do
not
be
angry
my
lord
because
I
am
not
able
to
get
up
before
you
for
the
customary
thing
with
women
is
upon
me
So
he
searched
on
carefully
but
did
not
find
the
teraphim
statues
36
At
that
Jacob
became
angry
and
began
to
criticize
Laban
Jacob
then
said
to
Laban
What
is
my
offense
and
for
what
sin
are
you
hotly
pursuing
me
37
Now
that
you
have
searched
through
all
my
goods
what
have
you
found
that
belongs
to
your
house
Put
it
here
in
front
of
my
brothers
and
your
brothers
and
let
them
decide
between
the
two
of
us
38
During
these
20
years
that
I
have
been
with
you
your
sheep
and
your
goats
never
miscarried
and
I
never
ate
the
rams
of
your
flock
39
I
did
not
bring
you
any
animal
torn
by
wild
beasts
I
would
stand
the
loss
of
it
myself
Whether
the
animal
was
stolen
by
day
or
was
stolen
by
night
you
would
demand
compensation
from
me
40
By
day
the
heat
consumed
me
and
the
cold
by
night
and
sleep
would
flee
from
my
eyes
41
This
makes
20
years
for
me
in
your
house
I
have
served
you
14
years
for
your
two
daughters
and
6
years
for
your
flock
and
you
kept
changing
my
wages
ten
times
42
If
the
God
of
my
father
the
God
of
Abraham
and
the
One
whom
Isaac
fears
had
not
been
on
my
side
you
would
now
have
sent
me
away
empty-handed
God
has
seen
my
affliction
and
the
toil
of
my
hands
and
that
is
why
he
reproved
you
last
night
43
Then
Laban
answered
Jacob
The
daughters
are
my
daughters
and
the
children
my
children
and
the
flock
my
flock
and
everything
you
are
looking
at
is
mine
and
my
daughters
What
can
I
do
today
against
these
or
against
their
children
whom
they
have
borne
44
Now
come
let
us
make
a
covenant
you
and
I
and
it
will
serve
as
a
witness
between
us
45
So
Jacob
took
a
stone
and
set
it
up
as
a
pillar
46
Then
Jacob
said
to
his
brothers
Pick
up
stones
And
they
took
stones
and
made
a
pile
After
that
they
ate
there
on
the
pile
of
stones
47
And
Laban
began
calling
it
Jegar-sahadutha
but
Jacob
called
it
Galeed
48
Laban
then
said
This
pile
of
stones
is
a
witness
between
me
and
you
today
That
is
why
he
named
it
Galeed
49
and
the
Watchtower
for
he
said
Let
Jehovah
keep
watch
between
you
and
me
when
we
are
out
of
each
others
sight
50
If
you
mistreat
my
daughters
and
if
you
start
taking
wives
in
addition
to
my
daughters
though
there
is
no
man
with
us
remember
that
God
will
be
a
witness
between
you
and
me
51
Laban
went
on
to
say
to
Jacob
Here
is
this
pile
of
stones
and
here
is
the
pillar
that
I
have
erected
between
you
and
me
52
This
pile
of
stones
is
a
witness
and
the
pillar
is
something
that
bears
witness
that
I
will
not
pass
beyond
this
pile
of
stones
to
bring
harm
to
you
and
you
will
not
pass
beyond
this
pile
of
stones
and
this
pillar
to
bring
harm
to
me
53
Let
the
God
of
Abraham
and
the
God
of
Nahor
the
God
of
their
father
judge
between
us
And
Jacob
swore
by
the
One
whom
his
father
Isaac
fears
54
After
that
Jacob
offered
a
sacrifice
in
the
mountain
and
invited
his
brothers
to
eat
bread
So
they
ate
and
spent
the
night
in
the
mountain
55
However
Laban
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
kissed
his
grandchildren
and
his
daughters
and
blessed
them
Then
Laban
departed
and
returned
home
1
Jacob
then
went
on
his
way
and
the
angels
of
God
met
up
with
him
2
As
soon
as
he
saw
them
Jacob
said
This
is
the
camp
of
God
So
he
named
that
place
Mahanaim
3
Then
Jacob
sent
messengers
ahead
of
him
to
his
brother
Esau
in
the
land
of
Seir
the
territory
of
Edom
4
and
he
commanded
them
This
is
what
you
will
say
to
my
lord
to
Esau
This
is
what
your
servant
Jacob
says
I
have
resided
with
Laban
for
a
long
time
until
now
5
And
I
have
acquired
bulls
donkeys
sheep
and
male
and
female
servants
and
I
send
this
message
to
inform
my
lord
in
order
to
find
favor
in
your
eyes
6
In
time
the
messengers
returned
to
Jacob
saying
We
met
your
brother
Esau
and
he
is
now
on
his
way
to
meet
you
and
there
are
400
men
with
him
7
And
Jacob
became
very
frightened
and
anxious
So
he
divided
the
people
who
were
with
him
as
well
as
the
flocks
the
cattle
and
the
camels
into
two
camps
8
He
said
If
Esau
attacks
the
one
camp
then
the
other
camp
will
be
able
to
escape
9
After
that
Jacob
said
O
God
of
my
father
Abraham
and
God
of
my
father
Isaac
O
Jehovah
you
who
are
saying
to
me
Return
to
your
land
and
to
your
relatives
and
I
will
deal
well
with
you

10
I
am
unworthy
of
all
the
loyal
love
and
of
all
the
faithfulness
that
you
have
shown
toward
your
servant
for
with
only
my
staff
I
crossed
this
Jordan
and
now
I
have
become
two
camps
11
Save
me
I
pray
you
from
the
hand
of
my
brother
Esau
for
I
am
afraid
of
him
that
he
may
come
and
attack
me
as
well
as
the
mothers
and
their
children
12
And
you
have
said
I
will
certainly
deal
well
with
you
and
I
will
make
your
offspring
like
the
grains
of
sand
of
the
sea
which
are
too
numerous
to
count
13
And
he
spent
the
night
there
Then
he
took
some
of
his
possessions
as
a
gift
for
Esau
his
brother
14
200
female
goats
20
male
goats
200
female
sheep
20
rams
15
30
camels
nursing
their
young
40
cows
10
bulls
20
female
donkeys
and
10
full-grown
male
donkeys
16
He
handed
them
over
to
his
servants
one
drove
after
another
and
he
said
to
his
servants
Cross
over
ahead
of
me
and
you
are
to
set
a
space
between
one
drove
and
the
next
17
He
also
commanded
the
first
one
In
case
Esau
my
brother
should
meet
you
and
ask
To
whom
do
you
belong
and
where
are
you
going
and
to
whom
do
these
ahead
of
you
belong
18
then
you
should
say
To
your
servant
Jacob
It
is
a
gift
sent
to
my
lord
to
Esau
and
look
he
himself
is
also
behind
us
19
And
he
commanded
also
the
second
the
third
and
all
those
following
the
droves
According
to
this
word
you
are
to
speak
to
Esau
when
you
meet
him
20
And
you
should
also
say
Here
is
your
servant
Jacob
behind
us
For
he
said
to
himself
If
I
appease
him
by
sending
a
gift
ahead
of
me
then
afterward
when
I
see
him
he
may
give
me
a
kindly
reception
21
So
the
gift
crossed
over
ahead
of
him
but
he
himself
spent
the
night
in
the
camp
22
Later
during
that
night
he
rose
and
took
his
two
wives
and
his
two
female
servants
and
his
11
young
sons
and
crossed
over
the
ford
of
Jabbok
23
So
he
took
them
and
brought
them
across
the
stream
and
he
brought
over
everything
else
he
had
24
Finally
Jacob
was
left
by
himself
Then
a
man
began
to
wrestle
with
him
until
the
dawn
broke
25
When
he
saw
that
he
had
not
prevailed
over
him
he
touched
the
socket
of
his
hip
and
the
socket
of
Jacobs
hip
was
dislocated
during
his
wrestling
with
him
26
After
that
he
said
Let
me
go
for
the
dawn
is
breaking
To
this
he
said
I
am
not
going
to
let
you
go
until
you
bless
me
27
So
he
said
to
him
What
is
your
name
to
which
he
said
Jacob
28
Then
he
said
Your
name
will
no
longer
be
Jacob
but
Israel
for
you
have
contended
with
God
and
with
men
and
you
have
at
last
prevailed
29
In
turn
Jacob
inquired
Tell
me
please
your
name
However
he
said
Why
is
it
that
you
ask
my
name
With
that
he
blessed
him
there
30
So
Jacob
named
the
place
Peniel
for
he
said
I
have
seen
God
face-to-face
yet
my
life
was
preserved
31
And
the
sun
rose
upon
him
as
soon
as
he
passed
by
Penuel
but
he
was
limping
because
of
his
hip
32
That
is
why
to
this
day
the
sons
of
Israel
are
not
accustomed
to
eat
the
thigh
sinew
which
is
on
the
socket
of
the
hip
joint
because
he
touched
the
socket
of
Jacobs
hip
joint
by
the
thigh
sinew
1
Now
Jacob
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
Esau
coming
and
400
men
were
with
him
So
he
divided
the
children
among
Leah
Rachel
and
the
two
female
servants
2
He
put
the
female
servants
and
their
children
in
front
Leah
and
her
children
after
them
and
Rachel
and
Joseph
behind
them
3
Then
he
himself
went
ahead
of
them
and
bowed
down
to
the
earth
seven
times
as
he
came
near
to
his
brother
4
But
Esau
ran
to
meet
him
and
he
embraced
him
and
kissed
him
and
they
burst
into
tears
5
When
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
the
women
and
the
children
he
said
Who
are
these
with
you
to
which
he
said
The
children
with
whom
God
has
favored
your
servant
6
At
that
the
female
servants
came
forward
with
their
children
and
bowed
down
7
and
Leah
too
came
forward
with
her
children
and
they
bowed
down
Then
Joseph
came
forward
with
Rachel
and
they
bowed
down
8
Esau
said
What
is
the
purpose
of
all
this
camp
of
travelers
that
I
have
met
He
replied
In
order
to
find
favor
in
the
eyes
of
my
lord
9
Then
Esau
said
I
have
a
great
many
possessions
my
brother
Keep
what
is
yours
10
However
Jacob
said
No
please
If
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
you
must
take
my
gift
from
my
hand
because
I
brought
it
so
that
I
could
see
your
face
And
I
have
seen
your
face
as
though
seeing
Gods
face
in
that
you
received
me
with
pleasure
11
Take
please
the
gift
conveying
my
blessing
that
was
brought
to
you
for
God
has
favored
me
and
I
have
everything
I
need
And
he
continued
to
urge
him
so
that
he
took
it
12
Later
Esau
said
Let
us
move
out
and
go
and
let
me
go
in
advance
of
you
13
But
he
said
to
him
My
lord
is
aware
that
the
children
are
delicate
and
that
in
my
care
are
sheep
and
cattle
nursing
their
young
If
they
are
driven
too
quickly
for
one
day
then
the
whole
flock
will
die
14
Let
my
lord
please
go
on
ahead
of
his
servant
but
I
will
continue
the
journey
more
slowly
at
the
pace
of
my
livestock
and
of
the
children
until
I
come
to
my
lord
at
Seir
15
Then
Esau
said
Please
let
me
leave
some
of
my
people
with
you
To
this
he
said
Why
do
this
Just
let
me
find
favor
in
the
eyes
of
my
lord
16
So
that
day
Esau
went
on
his
way
back
to
Seir
17
And
Jacob
journeyed
to
Succoth
and
he
built
a
house
for
himself
and
he
made
shelters
for
his
herd
That
was
why
he
named
the
place
Succoth
18
After
journeying
from
Paddan-aram
Jacob
arrived
safely
at
the
city
of
Shechem
in
the
land
of
Canaan
and
he
set
up
his
camp
near
the
city
19
Then
he
acquired
a
portion
of
the
field
where
he
pitched
his
tent
from
the
sons
of
Hamor
the
father
of
Shechem
for
100
pieces
of
money
20
There
he
set
up
an
altar
and
called
it
God
the
God
of
Israel
1
Now
Dinah
Jacobs
daughter
by
Leah
used
to
go
out
to
spend
time
with
the
young
women
of
the
land
2
When
Shechem
the
son
of
Hamor
the
Hivite
a
chieftain
of
the
land
saw
her
he
took
her
and
lay
down
with
her
and
violated
her
3
And
he
became
very
attached
to
Dinah
the
daughter
of
Jacob
and
he
fell
in
love
with
the
young
woman
and
spoke
persuasively
to
her
4
Finally
Shechem
said
to
Hamor
his
father
Get
me
this
young
woman
to
be
my
wife
5
When
Jacob
heard
that
he
had
defiled
Dinah
his
daughter
his
sons
were
with
his
herd
in
the
field
So
Jacob
kept
silent
until
they
returned
6
Later
Hamor
Shechems
father
went
out
to
speak
with
Jacob
7
But
the
sons
of
Jacob
heard
about
it
and
returned
from
the
field
right
away
They
were
offended
and
very
angry
because
he
had
disgraced
Israel
by
lying
down
with
Jacobs
daughter
something
that
should
not
be
done
8
Hamor
spoke
with
them
saying
My
son
Shechem
longs
for
your
daughter
Please
give
her
to
him
as
his
wife
9
and
form
marriage
alliances
with
us
Give
us
your
daughters
and
take
our
daughters
for
yourselves
10
You
may
dwell
with
us
and
the
land
will
become
available
for
you
Dwell
and
carry
on
trade
in
it
and
settle
in
it
11
Then
Shechem
said
to
her
father
and
to
her
brothers
Let
me
find
favor
in
your
eyes
and
I
will
give
you
whatever
you
ask
me
12
You
can
demand
from
me
a
very
high
bride
price
and
gift
I
am
willing
to
give
whatever
you
may
say
to
me
Just
give
me
the
young
woman
as
a
wife
13
And
Jacobs
sons
answered
Shechem
and
Hamor
his
father
deceitfully
because
he
had
defiled
Dinah
their
sister
14
They
said
to
them
We
cannot
possibly
do
such
a
thing
to
give
our
sister
to
a
man
who
is
not
circumcised
for
that
is
a
disgrace
to
us
15
We
can
only
consent
on
this
condition
that
you
become
like
us
and
circumcise
all
your
males
16
Then
we
will
give
our
daughters
to
you
and
we
will
take
your
daughters
for
ourselves
and
we
will
dwell
with
you
and
become
one
people
17
But
if
you
do
not
listen
to
us
and
get
circumcised
then
we
will
take
our
daughter
and
go
18
Their
words
pleased
Hamor
and
Shechem
Hamors
son
19
The
young
man
did
not
delay
in
doing
what
they
asked
because
he
found
delight
in
Jacobs
daughter
and
he
was
the
most
honorable
of
the
whole
house
of
his
father
20
So
Hamor
and
his
son
Shechem
went
to
the
city
gate
and
spoke
to
the
men
of
their
city
saying
21
These
men
wish
to
be
at
peace
with
us
Let
them
dwell
in
the
land
and
carry
on
trade
in
it
for
the
land
is
large
enough
to
accommodate
them
We
can
take
their
daughters
as
wives
and
our
daughters
we
can
give
to
them
22
Only
on
this
one
condition
will
the
men
consent
to
dwell
with
us
in
order
to
become
one
people
that
every
male
among
us
be
circumcised
just
the
way
they
are
circumcised
23
Then
will
not
their
possessions
their
wealth
and
all
their
livestock
be
ours
So
let
us
give
them
our
consent
that
they
may
dwell
with
us
24
All
those
going
out
by
the
gate
of
his
city
listened
to
Hamor
and
to
his
son
Shechem
and
all
the
males
got
circumcised
all
those
going
out
of
the
city
gate
25
However
on
the
third
day
when
they
were
still
in
pain
two
sons
of
Jacob
Simeon
and
Levi
Dinahs
brothers
each
took
his
sword
and
went
into
the
unsuspecting
city
and
killed
every
male
26
They
killed
Hamor
and
his
son
Shechem
with
the
sword
and
then
took
Dinah
from
Shechems
house
and
left
27
Jacobs
other
sons
came
upon
the
slain
men
and
plundered
the
city
because
they
had
defiled
their
sister
28
They
took
their
flocks
their
herds
their
donkeys
and
whatever
was
in
the
city
and
in
the
field
29
They
also
took
all
their
possessions
captured
all
their
little
children
and
their
wives
and
plundered
everything
in
the
houses
30
At
this
Jacob
said
to
Simeon
and
to
Levi
You
have
brought
great
trouble
on
me
in
making
me
a
stench
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
to
the
Canaanites
and
the
Perizzites
I
am
few
in
number
and
they
will
certainly
gather
together
to
attack
me
and
I
will
be
annihilated
I
and
my
house
31
But
they
said
Should
anyone
treat
our
sister
like
a
prostitute
1
After
that
God
said
to
Jacob
Rise
go
up
to
Bethel
and
dwell
there
and
make
an
altar
there
to
the
true
God
who
appeared
to
you
when
you
were
running
away
from
Esau
your
brother
2
Then
Jacob
said
to
his
household
and
to
all
who
were
with
him
Get
rid
of
the
foreign
gods
that
are
in
your
midst
and
cleanse
yourselves
and
change
your
garments
3
and
let
us
rise
and
go
up
to
Bethel
There
I
will
make
an
altar
to
the
true
God
who
answered
me
in
the
day
of
my
distress
and
who
has
been
with
me
wherever
I
have
gone
4
So
they
gave
Jacob
all
the
foreign
gods
they
had
and
the
earrings
that
were
in
their
ears
and
Jacob
buried
them
under
the
big
tree
that
was
close
to
Shechem
5
When
they
traveled
on
the
terror
of
God
struck
the
cities
around
them
so
they
did
not
chase
after
the
sons
of
Jacob
6
Jacob
eventually
came
to
Luz
that
is
Bethel
in
the
land
of
Canaan
he
and
all
the
people
with
him
7
There
he
built
an
altar
and
called
the
place
El-bethel
because
there
the
true
God
had
revealed
himself
to
him
when
he
had
run
away
from
his
brother
8
Later
Deborah
Rebekahs
nurse
died
and
was
buried
at
the
foot
of
Bethel
under
an
oak
So
he
named
it
Allon-bacuth
9
God
appeared
to
Jacob
once
again
while
he
was
coming
from
Paddan-aram
and
blessed
him
10
God
said
to
him
Your
name
is
Jacob
Your
name
will
no
longer
be
Jacob
but
Israel
will
be
your
name
And
he
began
to
call
him
Israel
11
God
further
said
to
him
I
am
God
Almighty
Be
fruitful
and
become
many
Nations
and
a
congregation
of
nations
will
come
from
you
and
kings
will
descend
from
you
12
As
for
the
land
that
I
have
given
to
Abraham
and
to
Isaac
to
you
I
will
give
it
and
to
your
offspring
after
you
I
will
give
the
land
13
Then
God
went
up
from
him
at
the
place
where
he
had
spoken
with
him
14
So
Jacob
set
up
a
pillar
in
the
place
where
he
had
spoken
with
him
a
pillar
of
stone
and
he
poured
a
drink
offering
on
it
and
poured
oil
on
it
15
And
Jacob
continued
to
call
the
place
where
God
had
spoken
with
him
Bethel
16
Then
they
pulled
away
from
Bethel
And
while
they
were
still
some
distance
from
Ephrath
Rachel
began
to
give
birth
and
her
labor
was
very
difficult
17
But
while
she
was
struggling
to
deliver
the
child
the
midwife
said
to
her
Do
not
be
afraid
for
you
will
have
this
son
also
18
Just
as
her
life
was
slipping
away
for
she
was
dying
she
named
him
Ben-oni
but
his
father
called
him
Benjamin
19
So
Rachel
died
and
was
buried
on
the
way
to
Ephrath
that
is
Bethlehem
20
Jacob
set
up
a
pillar
over
her
grave
it
is
the
pillar
of
Rachels
grave
to
this
day
21
After
that
Israel
pulled
away
and
pitched
his
tent
a
distance
beyond
the
tower
of
Eder
22
Once
while
Israel
was
dwelling
in
that
land
Reuben
went
and
lay
down
with
Bilhah
his
fathers
concubine
and
Israel
heard
about
it
So
there
were
12
sons
of
Jacob
23
The
sons
by
Leah
were
Jacobs
firstborn
Reuben
then
Simeon
Levi
Judah
Issachar
and
Zebulun
24
The
sons
by
Rachel
were
Joseph
and
Benjamin
25
And
the
sons
by
Bilhah
Rachels
servant
were
Dan
and
Naphtali
26
And
the
sons
by
Zilpah
Leahs
servant
were
Gad
and
Asher
These
are
Jacobs
sons
who
were
born
to
him
in
Paddan-aram
27
Jacob
eventually
came
to
where
his
father
Isaac
was
at
Mamre
to
Kiriath-arba
that
is
Hebron
where
Abraham
and
also
Isaac
had
resided
as
foreigners
28
Isaac
lived
to
be
180
years
old
29
Then
Isaac
breathed
his
last
and
died
and
was
gathered
to
his
people
after
a
long
and
satisfying
life
and
his
sons
Esau
and
Jacob
buried
him
1
This
is
the
history
of
Esau
that
is
Edom
2
Esau
took
his
wives
from
the
daughters
of
Canaan
Adah
the
daughter
of
Elon
the
Hittite
and
Oholibamah
the
daughter
of
Anah
the
granddaughter
of
Zibeon
the
Hivite
3
and
Basemath
Ishmaels
daughter
the
sister
of
Nebaioth
4
And
Adah
bore
Eliphaz
to
Esau
and
Basemath
bore
Reuel
5
and
Oholibamah
bore
Jeush
Jalam
and
Korah
These
are
the
sons
of
Esau
who
were
born
to
him
in
the
land
of
Canaan
6
After
that
Esau
took
his
wives
his
sons
his
daughters
all
the
members
of
his
household
his
herd
and
all
his
other
beasts
and
all
the
wealth
he
had
accumulated
in
the
land
of
Canaan
and
he
went
to
another
land
some
distance
away
from
Jacob
his
brother
7
For
their
goods
had
become
too
many
for
them
to
dwell
together
and
the
land
where
they
were
residing
was
not
able
to
sustain
them
because
of
their
herds
8
So
Esau
took
up
dwelling
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Seir
Esau
is
Edom
9
And
this
is
the
history
of

This
is

the
father
of
Edom
1
Jacob
continued
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
Canaan
where
his
father
had
lived
as
a
foreigner
2
This
is
the
history
of
Jacob
When
Joseph
was
17
years
old
the
young
man
was
tending
the
flock
with
the
sons
of
Bilhah
and
the
sons
of
Zilpah
the
wives
of
his
father
And
Joseph
brought
a
bad
report
about
them
to
their
father
3
Now
Israel
loved
Joseph
more
than
all
his
other
sons
because
he
was
the
son
of
his
old
age
and
he
had
a
special
robe
made
for
him
4
When
his
brothers
saw
that
their
father
loved
him
more
than
all
his
brothers
they
began
to
hate
him
and
they
could
not
speak
peaceably
to
him
5
Later
Joseph
had
a
dream
and
told
it
to
his
brothers
and
they
found
further
reason
to
hate
him
6
He
said
to
them
Please
listen
to
this
dream
that
I
had
7
There
we
were
binding
sheaves
in
the
middle
of
the
field
when
my
sheaf
got
up
and
stood
erect
and
your
sheaves
encircled
and
bowed
down
to
my
sheaf
8
His
brothers
said
to
him
Are
you
really
going
to
make
yourself
king
over
us
and
dominate
us
So
they
found
another
reason
to
hate
him
because
of
his
dreams
and
what
he
said
9
After
that
he
had
still
another
dream
and
he
related
it
to
his
brothers
I
have
had
another
dream
This
time
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
11
stars
were
bowing
down
to
me
10
Then
he
related
it
to
his
father
as
well
as
his
brothers
and
his
father
rebuked
him
and
said
to
him
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
dream
of
yours
Am
I
as
well
as
your
mother
and
your
brothers
really
going
to
come
and
bow
down
to
the
earth
to
you
11
And
his
brothers
grew
jealous
of
him
but
his
father
kept
the
saying
in
mind
12
His
brothers
now
went
to
pasture
their
fathers
flock
near
Shechem
13
Israel
later
said
to
Joseph
Your
brothers
are
tending
flocks
near
Shechem
are
they
not
Come
and
let
me
send
you
to
them
At
this
he
said
to
him
I
am
ready
14
So
he
said
to
him
Go
please
and
see
whether
your
brothers
are
well
See
how
the
flock
is
and
bring
word
back
to
me
With
that
he
sent
him
away
from
the
valley
of
Hebron
and
he
went
on
toward
Shechem
15
Later
a
man
found
him
as
he
was
wandering
in
a
field
The
man
asked
him
What
are
you
looking
for
16
To
this
he
said
I
am
looking
for
my
brothers
Please
tell
me
where
are
they
tending
flocks
17
The
man
continued
They
have
pulled
away
from
here
for
I
heard
them
saying
Let
us
go
to
Dothan
So
Joseph
went
after
his
brothers
and
found
them
at
Dothan
18
Now
they
caught
sight
of
him
from
a
distance
and
before
he
reached
them
they
began
plotting
against
him
to
put
him
to
death
19
So
they
said
to
one
another
Look
Here
comes
that
dreamer
20
Come
now
let
us
kill
him
and
pitch
him
into
one
of
the
waterpits
and
we
will
say
that
a
vicious
wild
animal
devoured
him
Then
let
us
see
what
will
become
of
his
dreams
21
When
Reuben
heard
this
he
tried
to
rescue
him
from
them
So
he
said
Let
us
not
take
his
life
22
Reuben
said
to
them
Do
not
shed
blood
Throw
him
into
this
waterpit
in
the
wilderness
but
do
not
harm
him
His
purpose
was
to
rescue
him
from
them
in
order
to
return
him
to
his
father
23
So
as
soon
as
Joseph
came
to
his
brothers
they
stripped
Joseph
of
his
robe
the
special
robe
that
he
wore
24
and
they
took
him
and
threw
him
into
the
waterpit
At
the
time
the
pit
was
empty
there
was
no
water
in
it
25
Then
they
sat
down
to
eat
When
they
looked
up
there
was
a
caravan
of
Ishmaelites
coming
from
Gilead
Their
camels
were
carrying
labdanum
gum
balsam
and
resinous
bark
and
they
were
on
their
way
down
to
Egypt
26
At
this
Judah
said
to
his
brothers
What
profit
would
there
be
if
we
killed
our
brother
and
covered
over
his
blood
27
Come
now
let
us
sell
him
to
the
Ishmaelites
and
do
not
let
our
hand
be
upon
him
After
all
he
is
our
brother
our
flesh
So
they
listened
to
their
brother
28
And
when
the
Midianite
merchants
were
passing
by
they
lifted
Joseph
up
out
of
the
waterpit
and
sold
him
to
the
Ishmaelites
for
20
pieces
of
silver
These
men
took
Joseph
into
Egypt
29
Later
when
Reuben
returned
to
the
waterpit
and
saw
that
Joseph
was
not
in
the
waterpit
he
ripped
his
garments
apart
30
When
he
returned
to
his
brothers
he
exclaimed
The
child
is
gone
And
I—what
am
I
going
to
do
31
So
they
took
Josephs
robe
and
slaughtered
a
male
goat
and
dipped
the
robe
in
the
blood
32
After
that
they
sent
the
special
robe
to
their
father
and
said
This
is
what
we
found
Please
examine
whether
this
is
your
sons
robe
or
not
33
Then
he
examined
it
and
exclaimed
It
is
my
sons
robe
A
vicious
wild
animal
must
have
devoured
him
Joseph
is
surely
torn
to
pieces
34
With
that
Jacob
ripped
his
garments
apart
and
put
sackcloth
around
his
waist
and
mourned
his
son
for
many
days
35
And
all
his
sons
and
all
his
daughters
kept
trying
to
comfort
him
but
he
kept
refusing
to
take
comfort
saying
I
will
go
down
into
the
Grave
mourning
my
son
And
his
father
continued
weeping
for
him
36
Now
the
Midianites
sold
him
in
Egypt
to
Potiphar
a
court
official
of
Pharaoh
and
the
chief
of
the
guard
1
About
that
time
Judah
left
his
brothers
and
pitched
his
tent
near
an
Adullamite
man
named
Hirah
2
There
Judah
saw
the
daughter
of
a
certain
Canaanite
named
Shua
So
he
took
her
and
had
relations
with
her
3
and
she
became
pregnant
Later
she
bore
a
son
and
he
named
him
Er
4
Again
she
became
pregnant
and
bore
a
son
and
named
him
Onan
5
Yet
again
she
bore
a
son
and
named
him
Shelah
He
was
in
Achzib
when
she
bore
him
6
In
time
Judah
took
a
wife
for
Er
his
firstborn
and
her
name
was
Tamar
7
But
Er
Judahs
firstborn
was
displeasing
to
Jehovah
so
Jehovah
put
him
to
death
8
In
view
of
that
Judah
said
to
Onan
Have
relations
with
your
brothers
wife
and
perform
brother-in-law
marriage
with
her
and
raise
up
offspring
for
your
brother
9
But
Onan
knew
that
the
offspring
would
not
be
considered
his
So
when
he
did
have
relations
with
his
brothers
wife
he
wasted
his
semen
on
the
ground
so
as
not
to
give
offspring
to
his
brother
10
What
he
did
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
so
he
also
put
him
to
death
11
Judah
said
to
Tamar
his
daughter-in-law
Dwell
as
a
widow
in
the
house
of
your
father
until
my
son
Shelah
grows
up

for
he
said
to
himself
He
too
may
die
like
his
brothers
So
Tamar
went
and
stayed
in
her
own
fathers
house
12
Some
time
passed
and
Judahs
wife
the
daughter
of
Shua
died
Judah
kept
the
mourning
period
and
then
he
went
to
his
sheepshearers
in
Timnah
with
his
companion
Hirah
the
Adullamite
13
Tamar
was
told
Here
your
father-in-law
is
going
up
to
Timnah
to
shear
his
sheep
14
With
that
she
removed
her
widows
clothing
and
veiled
herself
and
covered
herself
with
a
shawl
and
sat
down
at
the
entrance
of
Enaim
which
is
on
the
road
to
Timnah
for
she
saw
that
Shelah
had
grown
up
and
yet
she
had
not
been
given
to
him
as
a
wife
15
When
Judah
caught
sight
of
her
he
at
once
took
her
for
a
prostitute
because
she
had
covered
her
face
16
So
he
turned
aside
to
her
by
the
road
and
said
Allow
me
please
to
have
relations
with
you

for
he
did
not
know
that
she
was
his
daughter-in-law
However
she
said
What
will
you
give
me
that
you
may
have
relations
with
me
17
To
this
he
said
I
will
send
a
young
goat
from
my
herd
But
she
said
Will
you
give
a
security
until
you
send
it
18
He
continued
What
security
should
I
give
you
to
which
she
said
Your
seal
ring
and
your
cord
and
your
rod
that
is
in
your
hand
Then
he
gave
them
to
her
and
had
relations
with
her
and
she
became
pregnant
by
him
19
After
that
she
got
up
and
went
away
and
removed
her
shawl
and
clothed
herself
with
her
widows
clothing
20
And
Judah
sent
the
young
goat
by
the
hand
of
his
companion
the
Adullamite
to
get
back
the
security
from
the
hand
of
the
woman
but
he
never
found
her
21
He
inquired
of
the
men
of
her
place
saying
Where
is
that
temple
prostitute
in
Enaim
along
the
road
But
they
said
No
temple
prostitute
has
ever
been
in
this
place
22
Finally
he
returned
to
Judah
and
said
I
never
found
her
and
besides
the
men
of
the
place
said
No
temple
prostitute
has
ever
been
in
this
place
23
So
Judah
said
Let
her
take
them
for
herself
in
order
that
we
may
not
fall
into
contempt
At
any
rate
I
have
sent
this
young
goat
but
you
never
found
her
24
However
about
three
months
later
Judah
was
told
Tamar
your
daughter-in-law
has
acted
as
a
prostitute
and
she
is
also
pregnant
by
her
prostitution
At
that
Judah
said
Bring
her
out
and
let
her
be
burned
25
As
she
was
being
brought
out
she
sent
word
to
her
father-in-law
I
am
pregnant
by
the
man
to
whom
these
belong
Then
she
added
Please
examine
to
whom
these
belong
the
seal
ring
and
the
cord
and
the
rod
26
Then
Judah
examined
them
and
said
She
is
more
righteous
than
I
am
because
I
did
not
give
her
to
Shelah
my
son
And
he
had
no
further
sexual
relations
with
her
after
that
27
When
the
time
came
for
her
to
give
birth
there
were
twins
in
her
womb
28
As
she
was
giving
birth
one
put
out
his
hand
and
the
midwife
immediately
took
a
scarlet
thread
and
tied
it
around
his
hand
saying
This
one
came
out
first
29
But
as
soon
as
he
drew
back
his
hand
his
brother
came
out
and
she
exclaimed
What
a
breach
you
have
made
for
yourself
So
he
was
named
Perez
30
Afterward
his
brother
came
out
around
whose
hand
the
scarlet
thread
was
tied
and
he
was
named
Zerah
1
Now
Joseph
was
taken
down
to
Egypt
and
an
Egyptian
named
Potiphar
a
court
official
of
Pharaoh
and
chief
of
the
guard
bought
him
from
the
Ishmaelites
who
had
taken
him
down
there
2
But
Jehovah
was
with
Joseph
As
a
result
he
became
successful
and
was
put
over
the
house
of
his
master
the
Egyptian
3
And
his
master
saw
that
Jehovah
was
with
him
and
that
Jehovah
was
making
everything
that
he
did
successful
4
Joseph
kept
finding
favor
in
his
eyes
and
he
became
his
personal
attendant
So
he
appointed
him
over
his
house
and
he
put
him
in
charge
of
all
that
was
his
5
From
the
time
he
appointed
him
over
his
house
and
in
charge
of
all
that
was
his
Jehovah
kept
blessing
the
house
of
the
Egyptian
because
of
Joseph
and
Jehovahs
blessing
came
to
be
on
all
that
he
had
in
the
house
and
in
the
field
6
He
eventually
left
everything
that
was
his
in
Josephs
care
and
he
gave
no
thought
to
anything
except
the
food
he
was
eating
Moreover
Joseph
grew
to
be
well-built
and
handsome
7
Now
after
these
things
the
wife
of
his
master
began
to
cast
her
eyes
on
Joseph
and
say
Lie
down
with
me
8
But
he
refused
and
said
to
his
masters
wife
Here
my
master
does
not
know
what
is
with
me
in
the
house
and
he
has
entrusted
everything
he
has
into
my
care
9
There
is
no
one
greater
in
this
house
than
I
am
and
he
has
not
withheld
from
me
anything
at
all
except
you
because
you
are
his
wife
So
how
could
I
commit
this
great
badness
and
actually
sin
against
God
10
So
day
after
day
she
spoke
to
Joseph
but
he
never
consented
to
lie
with
her
or
to
remain
with
her
11
But
on
one
of
the
days
when
he
went
into
the
house
to
do
his
work
none
of
the
household
servants
were
in
the
house
12
Then
she
grabbed
hold
of
him
by
his
garment
and
said
Lie
down
with
me
But
he
left
his
garment
in
her
hand
and
fled
outside
13
As
soon
as
she
saw
that
he
had
left
his
garment
in
her
hand
and
had
fled
outside
14
she
began
to
cry
out
to
the
men
of
her
house
and
to
say
to
them
Look
He
brought
to
us
this
Hebrew
man
to
make
us
a
laughingstock
He
came
to
me
to
lie
down
with
me
but
I
began
to
cry
out
at
the
top
of
my
voice
15
Then
as
soon
as
he
heard
me
raising
my
voice
and
screaming
he
left
his
garment
beside
me
and
fled
outside
16
After
that
she
laid
his
garment
beside
her
until
his
master
came
to
his
house
17
Then
she
told
him
the
same
thing
saying
The
Hebrew
servant
whom
you
brought
to
us
came
to
me
to
make
me
a
laughingstock
18
But
as
soon
as
I
raised
my
voice
and
began
to
scream
he
left
his
garment
beside
me
and
fled
outside
19
As
soon
as
his
master
heard
the
words
his
wife
spoke
to
him
saying
These
are
the
things
your
servant
did
to
me

his
anger
blazed
20
So
Josephs
master
took
him
and
gave
him
over
to
the
prison
the
place
where
the
prisoners
of
the
king
were
kept
under
arrest
and
he
remained
there
in
the
prison
21
But
Jehovah
continued
with
Joseph
and
kept
showing
loyal
love
to
him
and
granting
him
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
chief
officer
of
the
prison
22
So
the
chief
officer
of
the
prison
put
Joseph
in
charge
of
all
the
prisoners
in
the
prison
and
everything
that
they
were
doing
there
he
was
the
one
having
it
done
23
The
chief
officer
of
the
prison
was
looking
after
absolutely
nothing
that
was
in
Josephs
care
for
Jehovah
was
with
Joseph
and
Jehovah
made
whatever
he
did
successful
1
After
these
things
the
chief
cupbearer
of
the
king
of
Egypt
and
the
chief
baker
sinned
against
their
lord
the
king
of
Egypt
2
So
Pharaoh
grew
indignant
at
his
two
officers
the
chief
cupbearer
and
the
chief
baker
3
and
he
committed
them
to
the
jail
of
the
house
of
the
chief
of
the
guard
to
the
place
where
Joseph
was
a
prisoner
4
Then
the
chief
of
the
guard
assigned
Joseph
to
be
with
them
and
to
take
care
of
them
and
they
remained
in
jail
for
some
time
5
The
cupbearer
and
the
baker
of
the
king
of
Egypt
who
were
confined
in
the
prison
each
had
a
dream
on
the
same
night
and
each
dream
had
its
own
interpretation
6
The
next
morning
when
Joseph
came
in
and
saw
them
they
looked
dejected
7
So
he
asked
the
officers
of
Pharaoh
who
were
in
custody
with
him
in
his
masters
house
Why
are
your
faces
gloomy
today
8
At
this
they
said
to
him
We
each
had
a
dream
but
there
is
no
interpreter
with
us
Joseph
said
to
them
Do
not
interpretations
belong
to
God
Relate
it
to
me
please
9
So
the
chief
cupbearer
related
his
dream
to
Joseph
saying
to
him
In
my
dream
there
was
a
vine
before
me
10
And
on
the
vine
there
were
three
twigs
and
as
it
was
sprouting
shoots
it
blossomed
and
its
clusters
ripened
into
grapes
11
And
Pharaohs
cup
was
in
my
hand
and
I
took
the
grapes
and
squeezed
them
out
into
Pharaohs
cup
After
that
I
put
the
cup
in
Pharaohs
hand
12
Then
Joseph
said
to
him
This
is
its
interpretation
The
three
twigs
are
three
days
13
Three
days
from
now
Pharaoh
will
bring
you
out
restoring
you
to
your
office
and
you
will
put
Pharaohs
cup
into
his
hand
as
you
did
before
when
you
were
his
cupbearer
14
Nevertheless
you
must
remember
me
when
things
go
well
with
you
Please
show
me
loyal
love
and
mention
me
to
Pharaoh
in
order
to
get
me
out
of
this
place
15
I
was
in
fact
kidnapped
from
the
land
of
the
Hebrews
and
I
have
not
done
anything
here
for
which
they
should
put
me
in
prison
16
When
the
chief
baker
saw
that
Joseph
had
interpreted
something
good
he
said
to
him
I
too
was
in
my
dream
and
there
were
three
baskets
of
white
bread
on
my
head
17
and
in
the
top
basket
there
were
all
sorts
of
baked
goods
for
Pharaoh
and
there
were
birds
eating
them
out
of
the
basket
on
top
of
my
head
18
Then
Joseph
answered
This
is
its
interpretation
The
three
baskets
are
three
days
19
Three
days
from
now
Pharaoh
will
behead
you
and
will
hang
you
on
a
stake
and
the
birds
will
eat
your
flesh
from
you
20
Now
the
third
day
was
Pharaohs
birthday
and
he
made
a
feast
for
all
his
servants
and
he
brought
out
both
the
chief
cupbearer
and
the
chief
baker
in
the
presence
of
his
servants
21
And
he
returned
the
chief
cupbearer
to
his
post
of
cupbearer
and
he
continued
to
hand
the
cup
to
Pharaoh
22
But
he
hanged
the
chief
baker
just
as
Joseph
had
interpreted
to
them
23
However
the
chief
cupbearer
did
not
remember
Joseph
he
kept
forgetting
him
1
At
the
end
of
two
full
years
Pharaoh
dreamed
that
he
was
standing
by
the
Nile
River
2
And
there
coming
up
from
the
river
were
seven
fine-looking
fat
cows
and
they
were
feeding
on
the
Nile
grass
3
There
were
seven
other
cows
that
looked
ugly
and
thin
coming
up
after
them
from
the
Nile
and
they
stood
alongside
the
fat
cows
by
the
bank
of
the
Nile
4
Then
the
ugly
thin
cows
began
to
eat
up
the
seven
fine-looking
fat
cows
At
this
Pharaoh
woke
up
5
Then
he
went
back
to
sleep
and
had
a
second
dream
There
were
seven
ears
of
grain
coming
up
on
one
stalk
full
and
choice
6
And
growing
up
after
them
were
seven
ears
of
grain
that
were
thin
and
scorched
by
the
east
wind
7
And
the
thin
ears
of
grain
began
to
swallow
up
the
seven
full
and
choice
ears
of
grain
At
this
Pharaoh
woke
up
and
realized
that
it
was
a
dream
8
But
in
the
morning
his
spirit
became
agitated
So
he
sent
for
all
the
magic-practicing
priests
of
Egypt
and
all
her
wise
men
Pharaoh
related
his
dreams
to
them
but
there
was
no
one
who
could
interpret
them
for
Pharaoh
9
At
that
the
chief
cupbearer
spoke
with
Pharaoh
saying
I
am
confessing
my
sins
today
10
Pharaoh
was
indignant
at
his
servants
So
he
committed
me
to
the
jail
of
the
house
of
the
chief
of
the
guard
both
me
and
the
chief
baker
11
After
that
we
each
had
a
dream
on
the
same
night
He
and
I
each
had
a
dream
with
its
own
interpretation
12
And
there
with
us
was
a
young
Hebrew
man
a
servant
of
the
chief
of
the
guard
When
we
related
them
to
him
he
interpreted
for
us
the
meaning
of
each
dream
13
It
happened
exactly
as
he
had
interpreted
to
us
I
was
restored
to
my
office
but
the
other
man
was
hanged
14
So
Pharaoh
sent
for
Joseph
and
they
brought
him
quickly
from
the
prison
He
shaved
and
changed
his
clothes
and
went
in
to
Pharaoh
15
Then
Pharaoh
said
to
Joseph
I
had
a
dream
but
there
is
no
one
to
interpret
it
Now
I
have
heard
it
said
about
you
that
you
can
hear
a
dream
and
interpret
it
16
At
this
Joseph
answered
Pharaoh
I
need
not
be
considered
God
will
speak
concerning
Pharaohs
welfare
17
Pharaoh
went
on
to
say
to
Joseph
In
my
dream
I
was
standing
on
the
bank
of
the
Nile
River
18
And
there
coming
up
from
the
Nile
were
seven
fine-looking
fat
cows
and
they
began
to
feed
on
the
Nile
grass
19
And
there
were
seven
other
cows
coming
up
after
them
poor
and
very
bad-looking
and
thin
I
have
never
seen
such
bad-looking
cows
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
20
And
the
skinny
bad
cows
began
to
eat
up
the
first
seven
fat
cows
21
But
when
they
had
consumed
them
no
one
could
have
known
that
they
had
done
so
since
their
appearance
was
just
as
bad
as
at
the
start
At
that
I
woke
up
22
After
that
I
saw
in
my
dream
seven
ears
of
grain
coming
up
on
one
stalk
full
and
choice
23
Growing
up
after
them
were
seven
ears
of
shriveled
grain
thin
and
scorched
by
the
east
wind
24
Then
the
thin
ears
of
grain
began
to
swallow
up
the
seven
choice
ears
of
grain
So
I
told
it
to
the
magic-practicing
priests
but
there
was
no
one
who
could
explain
it
to
me
25
Then
Joseph
said
to
Pharaoh
The
dreams
of
Pharaoh
are
one
and
the
same
The
true
God
has
told
to
Pharaoh
what
He
will
do
26
The
seven
good
cows
are
seven
years
Likewise
the
seven
good
ears
of
grain
are
seven
years
The
dreams
are
one
and
the
same
27
The
seven
skinny
and
bad
cows
that
came
up
after
them
are
seven
years
and
the
seven
empty
ears
of
grain
scorched
by
the
east
wind
will
prove
to
be
seven
years
of
famine
28
This
is
just
as
I
told
to
Pharaoh
The
true
God
has
caused
Pharaoh
to
see
what
He
will
do
29
There
are
to
be
seven
years
of
great
abundance
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
30
But
seven
years
of
famine
will
certainly
arise
after
them
and
all
the
abundance
in
the
land
of
Egypt
will
certainly
be
forgotten
and
the
famine
will
exhaust
the
land
31
And
the
previous
abundance
in
the
land
will
not
be
remembered
because
of
the
famine
afterward
for
it
will
be
very
severe
32
The
dream
was
given
twice
to
Pharaoh
because
the
matter
has
been
firmly
established
by
the
true
God
and
the
true
God
will
soon
carry
it
out
33
So
now
let
Pharaoh
look
for
a
man
who
is
discreet
and
wise
and
place
him
over
the
land
of
Egypt
34
Let
Pharaoh
take
action
and
appoint
overseers
in
the
land
and
he
should
collect
one
fifth
of
the
produce
of
Egypt
during
the
seven
years
of
abundance
35
And
let
them
collect
all
the
food
during
these
coming
good
years
and
let
them
stockpile
grain
under
Pharaohs
authority
as
food
to
be
stored
in
the
cities
and
safeguarded
there
36
The
food
should
serve
as
a
supply
for
the
land
for
the
seven
years
of
famine
that
will
occur
in
the
land
of
Egypt
so
that
the
land
may
not
perish
in
the
famine
37
This
proposal
seemed
good
to
Pharaoh
and
all
his
servants
38
So
Pharaoh
said
to
his
servants
Can
another
man
be
found
like
this
one
in
whom
there
is
the
spirit
of
God
39
Pharaoh
then
said
to
Joseph
Since
God
has
caused
you
to
know
all
of
this
there
is
no
one
as
discreet
and
wise
as
you
40
You
will
personally
be
over
my
house
and
all
my
people
will
obey
you
implicitly
Only
in
my
role
as
king
will
I
be
greater
than
you
41
And
Pharaoh
added
to
Joseph
See
I
am
putting
you
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt
42
Then
Pharaoh
removed
his
signet
ring
from
his
own
hand
and
put
it
on
Josephs
hand
and
clothed
him
with
garments
of
fine
linen
and
placed
a
necklace
of
gold
around
his
neck
43
Moreover
he
had
him
ride
in
the
second
chariot
of
honor
that
he
had
and
they
would
call
out
ahead
of
him
Avrékh
Thus
he
put
him
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt
44
Pharaoh
further
said
to
Joseph
I
am
Pharaoh
but
without
your
authorization
no
man
may
do
a
single
thing
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
45
After
that
Pharaoh
gave
Joseph
the
name
Zaphenath-paneah
and
gave
him
Asenath
the
daughter
of
Potiphera
the
priest
of
On
as
a
wife
And
Joseph
began
to
oversee
the
land
of
Egypt
46
Joseph
was
30
years
old
when
he
stood
before
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
Then
Joseph
went
out
from
before
Pharaoh
and
traveled
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt
47
And
during
the
seven
years
of
abundance
the
land
went
on
producing
plentifully
48
And
he
kept
collecting
all
the
food
of
the
seven
years
from
the
land
of
Egypt
and
he
would
stockpile
the
food
in
the
cities
In
each
city
he
would
store
the
food
from
the
fields
around
it
49
Joseph
continued
stockpiling
grain
in
very
great
quantity
like
the
sand
of
the
sea
until
finally
they
gave
up
measuring
it
because
it
could
not
be
measured
50
Before
the
year
of
the
famine
arrived
two
sons
were
born
to
Joseph
whom
Asenath
the
daughter
of
Potiphera
the
priest
of
On
bore
to
him
51
Joseph
named
the
firstborn
Manasseh
for
he
said
God
has
made
me
forget
all
my
trouble
and
all
the
house
of
my
father
52
And
he
named
the
second
one
Ephraim
for
he
said
God
has
made
me
fruitful
in
the
land
of
my
affliction
53
Then
the
seven
years
of
abundance
in
the
land
of
Egypt
ended
54
and
the
seven
years
of
famine
began
just
as
Joseph
had
said
The
famine
developed
in
all
the
lands
but
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
there
was
bread
55
Eventually
all
the
land
of
Egypt
suffered
from
the
famine
and
the
people
began
to
cry
to
Pharaoh
for
bread
Then
Pharaoh
said
to
all
the
Egyptians
Go
to
Joseph
and
do
whatever
he
tells
you
56
The
famine
continued
over
all
the
surface
of
the
earth
Then
Joseph
began
to
open
up
all
the
granaries
that
were
among
them
and
to
sell
to
the
Egyptians
as
the
famine
had
a
strong
grip
on
the
land
of
Egypt
57
Moreover
people
of
all
the
earth
came
to
Egypt
to
buy
from
Joseph
because
the
famine
had
a
strong
grip
on
all
the
earth
1
When
Jacob
learned
that
there
was
grain
in
Egypt
he
said
to
his
sons
Why
do
you
just
keep
looking
at
one
another
2
He
added
I
have
heard
that
there
is
grain
in
Egypt
Go
down
there
and
buy
some
for
us
so
that
we
may
stay
alive
and
not
die
3
So
ten
of
Josephs
brothers
went
down
to
buy
grain
from
Egypt
4
But
Jacob
did
not
send
Benjamin
Josephs
brother
with
his
other
brothers
for
he
said
Perhaps
a
fatal
accident
may
befall
him
5
So
Israels
sons
came
along
with
the
others
who
were
coming
to
buy
because
the
famine
had
extended
to
the
land
of
Canaan
6
Joseph
was
the
man
in
authority
over
the
land
and
he
was
the
one
who
sold
grain
to
all
the
people
of
the
earth
So
Josephs
brothers
came
and
bowed
low
to
him
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
7
When
Joseph
saw
his
brothers
he
immediately
recognized
them
but
he
concealed
his
identity
from
them
So
he
spoke
harshly
with
them
and
said
Where
have
you
come
from
to
which
they
said
From
the
land
of
Canaan
to
buy
food
8
Thus
Joseph
recognized
his
brothers
but
they
did
not
recognize
him
9
Joseph
immediately
remembered
the
dreams
that
he
had
dreamed
about
them
and
he
said
to
them
You
are
spies
You
have
come
to
see
the
vulnerable
areas
of
the
land
10
Then
they
said
to
him
No
my
lord
but
your
servants
have
come
to
buy
food
11
We
are
all
sons
of
but
one
man
We
are
upright
men
Your
servants
do
not
act
as
spies
12
But
he
said
to
them
Not
so
You
have
come
to
see
the
vulnerable
areas
of
the
land
13
At
this
they
said
Your
servants
are
12
brothers
We
are
the
sons
of
but
one
man
in
the
land
of
Canaan
and
the
youngest
is
now
with
our
father
whereas
the
other
one
is
no
more
14
However
Joseph
said
to
them
It
is
just
as
I
said
to
you—You
are
spies
15
By
this
you
will
be
tested
As
surely
as
Pharaoh
lives
you
will
not
leave
this
place
until
your
youngest
brother
comes
here
16
Send
one
of
you
to
bring
your
brother
while
you
remain
in
bondage
In
this
way
your
words
may
be
tested
out
to
see
if
you
are
telling
the
truth
And
if
not
then
as
surely
as
Pharaoh
lives
you
are
spies
17
With
that
he
put
them
together
in
custody
for
three
days
18
Joseph
said
to
them
on
the
third
day
Do
this
and
live
for
I
fear
God
19
If
you
are
upright
let
one
of
your
brothers
remain
in
bondage
in
your
house
of
custody
but
the
rest
of
you
may
go
and
take
grain
to
alleviate
the
famine
in
your
households
20
Then
bring
your
youngest
brother
to
me
so
that
your
words
will
be
found
trustworthy
and
you
will
not
die
And
they
did
so
21
And
they
said
to
one
another
We
are
surely
being
punished
on
account
of
our
brother
because
we
saw
his
distress
when
he
begged
us
to
show
compassion
but
we
did
not
listen
That
is
why
this
distress
has
come
upon
us
22
Then
Reuben
answered
them
Did
I
not
say
to
you
Do
not
sin
against
the
child

but
you
would
not
listen
Now
his
blood
is
certainly
being
asked
back
23
But
they
did
not
know
that
Joseph
understood
for
there
was
an
interpreter
between
them
24
So
he
turned
away
from
them
and
began
to
weep
When
he
returned
and
spoke
to
them
again
he
took
Simeon
from
them
and
bound
him
before
their
eyes
25
Joseph
then
gave
the
command
to
fill
up
their
bags
with
grain
and
to
return
each
mans
money
to
his
own
sack
and
to
give
them
provisions
for
the
journey
This
was
done
for
them
26
So
they
loaded
their
grain
on
their
donkeys
and
left
from
there
27
When
one
of
them
opened
his
sack
to
give
fodder
to
his
donkey
at
the
lodging
place
he
saw
his
money
there
in
the
mouth
of
his
bag
28
At
that
he
said
to
his
brothers
My
money
has
been
returned
and
now
here
it
is
in
my
bag
Then
their
hearts
sank
and
trembling
they
turned
to
one
another
and
said
What
is
this
that
God
has
done
to
us
29
When
they
came
to
Jacob
their
father
in
the
land
of
Canaan
they
told
him
all
the
things
that
had
befallen
them
saying
30
The
man
who
is
the
lord
of
the
country
spoke
harshly
with
us
and
accused
us
of
spying
on
the
country
31
But
we
said
to
him
We
are
upright
men
We
are
not
spies
32
We
are
12
brothers
the
sons
of
our
father
One
is
no
more
and
the
youngest
is
now
with
our
father
in
the
land
of
Canaan
33
But
the
man
who
is
the
lord
of
the
country
said
to
us
By
this
I
will
know
that
you
are
upright
Leave
one
of
your
brothers
with
me
Then
take
something
to
alleviate
the
famine
in
your
households
and
go
34
And
bring
your
youngest
brother
to
me
so
that
I
may
know
that
you
are
not
spies
but
upright
men
I
will
then
give
your
brother
back
to
you
and
you
may
carry
on
trade
in
the
land
35
As
they
were
emptying
their
sacks
here
was
each
ones
bag
of
money
in
his
sack
When
they
and
their
father
saw
their
bags
of
money
they
became
afraid
36
Jacob
their
father
exclaimed
to
them
It
is
I
you
have
bereaved
Joseph
is
no
more
and
Simeon
is
no
more
and
you
are
going
to
take
Benjamin
It
is
upon
me
that
all
these
things
have
come
37
But
Reuben
said
to
his
father
You
may
put
to
death
my
own
two
sons
if
I
do
not
bring
him
back
to
you
Give
him
over
to
my
care
and
I
will
return
him
to
you
38
However
he
said
My
son
will
not
go
down
with
you
because
his
brother
is
dead
and
he
alone
is
left
If
a
fatal
accident
should
befall
him
on
the
journey
you
would
make
then
you
would
certainly
bring
down
my
gray
hairs
to
the
Grave
in
grief
1
Now
the
famine
was
severe
in
the
land
2
So
when
they
had
finished
eating
the
grain
they
had
brought
from
Egypt
their
father
said
to
them
Return
and
buy
a
little
food
for
us
3
Then
Judah
said
to
him
The
man
clearly
warned
us
You
must
not
see
my
face
again
unless
your
brother
is
with
you
4
If
you
send
our
brother
with
us
we
will
go
down
and
buy
food
for
you
5
But
if
you
do
not
send
him
we
will
not
go
down
for
the
man
said
to
us
You
must
not
see
my
face
again
unless
your
brother
is
with
you
6
And
Israel
asked
Why
did
you
have
to
bring
this
trouble
on
me
by
telling
the
man
that
you
had
another
brother
7
They
replied
The
man
directly
inquired
concerning
us
and
our
relatives
saying
Is
your
father
still
alive
Do
you
have
another
brother
and
we
told
him
these
facts
How
could
we
possibly
know
that
he
would
say
Bring
your
brother
down
8
Judah
then
urged
Israel
his
father
Send
the
boy
with
me
and
let
us
go
on
our
way
so
that
we
may
live
and
not
die—we
and
you
and
our
children
9
I
will
be
a
guarantee
for
his
safety
You
may
hold
me
responsible
If
I
fail
to
return
him
to
you
and
present
him
to
you
I
will
have
sinned
against
you
for
all
time
10
But
if
we
had
not
delayed
we
could
have
been
there
and
back
twice
by
now
11
So
Israel
their
father
said
to
them
If
it
must
be
so
then
do
this
Take
the
finest
products
of
the
land
in
your
bags
and
carry
them
down
to
the
man
as
a
gift
a
little
balsam
a
little
honey
labdanum
resinous
bark
pistachio
nuts
and
almonds
12
Take
double
the
money
with
you
and
also
take
back
the
money
that
was
returned
in
the
mouth
of
your
bags
Maybe
it
was
a
mistake
13
Take
your
brother
and
go
return
to
the
man
14
May
God
Almighty
grant
you
pity
from
the
man
so
that
he
may
release
to
you
your
other
brother
and
Benjamin
But
as
for
me
if
I
must
be
bereaved
I
will
be
bereaved
15
So
the
men
took
this
gift
and
they
took
double
the
money
in
their
hand
and
Benjamin
Then
they
rose
and
went
on
their
way
down
to
Egypt
and
again
stood
before
Joseph
16
When
Joseph
saw
Benjamin
with
them
he
at
once
said
to
the
man
who
was
over
his
house
Take
the
men
to
the
house
and
slaughter
animals
and
prepare
the
meal
for
the
men
are
to
eat
with
me
at
noon
17
Immediately
the
man
did
just
as
Joseph
had
said
and
he
took
them
to
Josephs
house
18
But
the
men
became
afraid
when
they
were
taken
to
Josephs
house
and
they
began
to
say
It
is
because
of
the
money
that
was
returned
in
our
bags
the
last
time
that
we
are
being
brought
here
Now
they
will
attack
us
and
make
us
slaves
and
take
our
donkeys
19
So
they
approached
the
man
who
was
over
Josephs
house
and
spoke
to
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
20
They
said
Pardon
us
my
lord
We
did
come
down
the
first
time
to
buy
food
21
But
when
we
arrived
at
our
lodging
place
and
began
opening
our
bags
why
here
was
the
money
of
each
one
in
the
mouth
of
his
bag
our
money
in
full
weight
So
we
would
like
to
return
it
personally
22
And
we
have
brought
more
money
to
buy
food
We
do
not
know
who
placed
our
money
in
our
bags
23
Then
he
said
It
is
all
right
Do
not
be
afraid
Your
God
and
the
God
of
your
father
put
treasure
in
your
bags
Your
money
came
first
to
me
After
that
he
brought
out
Simeon
to
them
24
Then
the
man
brought
them
into
Josephs
house
and
gave
them
water
for
washing
their
feet
and
he
gave
fodder
for
their
donkeys
25
And
they
prepared
the
gift
for
Josephs
coming
at
noon
for
they
had
heard
that
they
were
going
to
eat
a
meal
there
26
When
Joseph
went
into
the
house
they
brought
their
gift
to
him
into
the
house
and
prostrated
themselves
to
him
to
the
ground
27
After
this
he
inquired
about
their
welfare
and
said
How
is
your
aged
father
of
whom
you
have
spoken
Is
he
still
alive
28
To
this
they
said
Your
servant
our
father
is
well
He
is
still
alive
Then
they
bowed
down
and
prostrated
themselves
29
When
he
looked
up
and
saw
Benjamin
his
brother
the
son
of
his
mother
he
said
Is
this
your
brother
the
youngest
one
of
whom
you
have
spoken
to
me
He
added
May
God
show
you
his
favor
my
son
30
Joseph
then
hurried
out
because
he
was
overcome
with
emotion
for
his
brother
and
he
looked
for
a
place
to
weep
So
he
went
into
a
private
room
and
gave
way
to
tears
there
31
After
that
he
washed
his
face
and
went
out
now
in
control
of
himself
and
he
said
Serve
the
meal
32
They
served
him
by
himself
and
them
by
themselves
and
the
Egyptians
with
him
ate
by
themselves
for
the
Egyptians
could
not
eat
a
meal
with
the
Hebrews
because
that
is
a
detestable
thing
to
the
Egyptians
33
The
brothers
were
seated
before
him
the
firstborn
according
to
his
right
as
firstborn
and
the
youngest
according
to
his
youth
and
they
kept
looking
at
one
another
in
amazement
34
He
kept
sending
portions
of
food
from
his
table
to
theirs
but
he
increased
Benjamins
portion
five
times
the
size
of
the
portions
of
all
the
others
So
they
continued
banqueting
and
drinking
with
him
to
the
full
1
Later
he
commanded
the
man
who
was
over
his
house
Fill
the
bags
of
the
men
with
as
much
food
as
they
can
carry
and
place
the
money
of
each
one
in
the
mouth
of
his
bag
2
But
you
must
place
my
cup
the
silver
cup
in
the
mouth
of
the
bag
of
the
youngest
along
with
the
money
for
his
grain
So
he
did
as
Joseph
had
instructed
3
In
the
morning
when
it
had
become
light
the
men
were
sent
away
with
their
donkeys
4
They
had
not
gone
far
from
the
city
when
Joseph
said
to
the
man
who
was
over
his
house
Get
up
Chase
after
the
men
When
you
overtake
them
say
to
them
Why
have
you
repaid
bad
for
good
5
Is
not
this
what
my
master
drinks
from
and
uses
to
read
omens
expertly
It
is
a
wicked
thing
you
have
done
6
So
he
overtook
them
and
spoke
these
words
to
them
7
But
they
said
to
him
Why
does
my
lord
say
such
a
thing
It
is
unthinkable
that
your
servants
would
do
anything
like
this
8
Why
the
money
that
we
found
in
the
mouth
of
our
bags
we
brought
back
to
you
from
the
land
of
Canaan
How
then
could
we
steal
silver
or
gold
from
the
house
of
your
master
9
If
it
is
found
with
one
of
your
slaves
let
him
die
and
the
rest
of
us
will
also
become
slaves
to
my
master
10
So
he
said
Let
it
be
as
you
say
The
one
with
whom
it
is
found
will
become
my
slave
but
the
rest
of
you
will
be
innocent
11
With
that
each
one
quickly
lowered
his
bag
to
the
ground
and
opened
it
12
He
searched
carefully
starting
with
the
oldest
and
finishing
with
the
youngest
Finally
the
cup
was
found
in
Benjamins
bag
13
Then
they
ripped
their
garments
apart
and
each
of
them
lifted
his
load
back
onto
his
donkey
and
returned
to
the
city
14
When
Judah
and
his
brothers
went
into
Josephs
house
he
was
still
there
and
they
fell
to
the
ground
before
him
15
Joseph
said
to
them
What
is
this
deed
that
you
have
done
Did
you
not
know
that
a
man
like
me
can
expertly
read
omens
16
At
this
Judah
replied
What
can
we
say
to
my
master
What
can
we
speak
And
how
can
we
prove
ourselves
righteous
The
true
God
has
found
out
the
error
of
your
slaves
We
are
now
slaves
to
my
master
both
we
and
the
one
in
whose
hand
the
cup
was
found
17
However
he
said
It
is
unthinkable
for
me
to
do
this
The
man
in
whose
hand
the
cup
was
found
is
the
one
who
will
become
a
slave
to
me
As
for
the
rest
of
you
go
up
in
peace
to
your
father
18
Judah
now
approached
him
and
said
I
beg
you
my
master
please
let
your
slave
speak
a
word
in
my
masters
ears
and
do
not
become
angry
with
your
slave
for
you
are
like
Pharaoh
himself
19
My
master
asked
his
slaves
Do
you
have
a
father
or
a
brother
20
So
we
said
to
my
master
We
do
have
an
aged
father
and
a
child
of
his
old
age
the
youngest
But
his
brother
is
dead
so
he
is
the
only
remaining
son
of
his
mother
and
his
father
loves
him
21
After
that
you
said
to
your
slaves
Bring
him
down
to
me
so
that
I
may
see
him
22
But
we
said
to
my
master
The
boy
is
not
able
to
leave
his
father
If
he
did
leave
him
his
father
would
certainly
die
23
Then
you
said
to
your
slaves
Unless
your
youngest
brother
comes
down
with
you
you
may
not
see
my
face
anymore
24
So
we
went
up
to
your
slave
my
father
and
told
him
the
words
of
my
master
25
Later
our
father
said
Return
and
buy
a
little
food
for
us
26
But
we
said
We
are
not
able
to
go
down
If
our
youngest
brother
is
with
us
we
will
go
down
for
we
cannot
see
the
mans
face
unless
our
youngest
brother
is
with
us
27
Then
your
slave
my
father
said
to
us
You
well
know
that
my
wife
bore
but
two
sons
to
me
28
But
one
of
them
left
me
and
I
said
He
must
surely
have
been
torn
to
pieces
and
I
have
not
seen
him
until
now
29
If
you
were
to
take
this
one
also
out
of
my
sight
and
a
fatal
accident
were
to
befall
him
you
would
certainly
bring
down
my
gray
hairs
to
the
Grave
with
calamity
30
And
now
if
I
return
to
your
slave
my
father
without
the
boy
along
with
us
since
his
own
life
is
bound
up
with
this
ones
life
31
then
as
soon
as
he
sees
that
the
boy
is
not
there
he
will
die
and
your
slaves
will
indeed
bring
down
the
gray
hairs
of
your
slave
our
father
to
the
Grave
in
grief
32
Your
slave
gave
a
guarantee
to
my
father
for
the
boy
saying
If
I
fail
to
bring
him
back
to
you
then
I
will
have
sinned
against
my
father
forever
33
So
now
please
let
your
slave
stay
instead
of
the
boy
as
my
masters
slave
in
order
that
the
boy
may
return
with
his
brothers
34
How
can
I
return
to
my
father
without
the
boy
along
with
me
I
could
not
bear
looking
on
when
this
calamity
befalls
my
father
1
At
this
Joseph
could
no
longer
control
himself
before
all
his
attendants
So
he
cried
out
Have
everyone
leave
me
No
one
else
stayed
with
him
while
Joseph
made
himself
known
to
his
brothers
2
Then
he
began
to
weep
so
loudly
that
the
Egyptians
heard
it
and
Pharaohs
house
heard
it
3
Finally
Joseph
said
to
his
brothers
I
am
Joseph
Is
my
father
still
alive
But
his
brothers
were
unable
to
answer
him
at
all
because
they
were
astonished
on
account
of
him
4
So
Joseph
said
to
his
brothers
Come
close
to
me
please
With
that
they
came
close
to
him
Then
he
said
I
am
Joseph
your
brother
whom
you
sold
into
Egypt
5
But
now
do
not
be
upset
and
do
not
reproach
one
another
because
you
sold
me
here
because
God
has
sent
me
ahead
of
you
for
the
preservation
of
life
6
This
is
the
second
year
of
the
famine
in
the
land
and
there
are
yet
five
years
in
which
there
will
be
no
plowing
or
harvest
7
But
God
sent
me
ahead
of
you
in
order
to
preserve
for
you
a
remnant
on
the
earth
and
to
keep
you
alive
by
a
great
deliverance
8
So
then
it
was
not
you
who
sent
me
here
but
it
was
the
true
God
in
order
to
appoint
me
as
chief
adviser
to
Pharaoh
and
lord
for
all
his
house
and
ruler
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt
9
Return
quickly
to
my
father
and
you
must
say
to
him
This
is
what
your
son
Joseph
has
said
God
has
appointed
me
lord
over
all
Egypt
Come
down
to
me
Do
not
delay
10
You
must
dwell
in
the
land
of
Goshen
where
you
will
be
near
me—you
your
sons
your
grandsons
your
flocks
your
herds
and
everything
you
have
11
I
will
supply
you
with
food
there
for
there
are
yet
five
years
of
famine
Otherwise
you
and
your
house
and
everything
you
have
will
come
to
poverty
12
You
and
my
brother
Benjamin
can
now
see
with
your
own
eyes
that
I
am
really
the
one
speaking
to
you
13
So
you
must
tell
my
father
about
all
my
glory
in
Egypt
and
everything
you
have
seen
Now
hurry
and
bring
my
father
down
here
14
Then
he
embraced
his
brother
Benjamin
and
gave
way
to
weeping
and
Benjamin
wept
with
his
arms
around
his
neck
15
And
he
kissed
all
his
brothers
and
wept
over
them
and
after
that
his
brothers
spoke
with
him
16
The
news
reached
the
house
of
Pharaoh
Josephs
brothers
have
come
It
was
good
in
the
eyes
of
Pharaoh
and
his
servants
17
So
Pharaoh
said
to
Joseph
Tell
your
brothers
Do
this
Load
your
beasts
of
burden
and
go
to
the
land
of
Canaan
18
and
take
your
father
and
your
households
and
come
here
to
me
I
will
give
you
the
good
things
of
the
land
of
Egypt
and
you
will
eat
the
richest
part
of
the
land
19
And
you
are
commanded
to
tell
them
Do
this
Take
wagons
from
the
land
of
Egypt
for
your
children
and
your
wives
and
you
must
bring
your
father
on
one
of
them
and
come
here
20
Do
not
worry
about
your
belongings
for
the
best
of
all
the
land
of
Egypt
is
yours
21
And
the
sons
of
Israel
did
so
and
Joseph
gave
them
wagons
according
to
Pharaohs
orders
and
he
gave
them
provisions
for
the
journey
22
To
each
of
them
he
gave
individual
changes
of
clothing
but
to
Benjamin
he
gave
300
silver
pieces
and
five
changes
of
clothing
23
And
to
his
father
he
sent
the
following
ten
donkeys
carrying
good
things
of
Egypt
and
ten
female
donkeys
carrying
grain
and
bread
and
sustenance
for
his
father
for
the
journey
24
So
he
sent
his
brothers
off
and
as
they
departed
he
said
to
them
Do
not
become
upset
with
one
another
on
the
way
25
Then
they
went
up
from
Egypt
and
came
into
the
land
of
Canaan
to
their
father
Jacob
26
Then
they
reported
to
him
Joseph
is
still
alive
and
he
is
the
ruler
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt
But
his
heart
grew
numb
because
he
did
not
believe
them
27
When
they
went
on
telling
him
all
the
words
that
Joseph
had
spoken
to
them
and
when
he
saw
the
wagons
that
Joseph
had
sent
to
carry
him
the
spirit
of
their
father
Jacob
began
to
revive
28
Israel
exclaimed
It
is
enough
My
son
Joseph
is
still
alive
I
must
go
and
see
him
before
I
die
1
So
Israel
took
all
that
he
had
and
departed
When
he
arrived
at
Beer-sheba
he
offered
sacrifices
to
the
God
of
his
father
Isaac
2
Then
God
spoke
to
Israel
in
a
vision
by
night
and
said
Jacob
Jacob
to
which
he
said
Here
I
am
3
He
said
I
am
the
true
God
the
God
of
your
father
Do
not
be
afraid
to
go
down
to
Egypt
for
there
I
will
make
you
into
a
great
nation
4
I
myself
will
go
down
with
you
to
Egypt
and
I
myself
will
also
bring
you
back
from
there
and
Joseph
will
lay
his
hand
on
your
eyes
5
After
that
Jacob
departed
from
Beer-sheba
and
the
sons
of
Israel
transported
Jacob
their
father
and
their
children
and
their
wives
in
the
wagons
that
Pharaoh
had
sent
to
transport
him
6
They
took
along
their
herds
and
their
goods
which
they
had
accumulated
in
the
land
of
Canaan
And
so
they
came
into
Egypt
Jacob
and
all
his
offspring
with
him
7
He
brought
with
him
into
Egypt
his
sons
and
his
grandsons
his
daughters
and
his
granddaughters—all
his
offspring

All
the

of
the
house
of
Jacob
who
came
into
Egypt
were

28
Jacob
sent
Judah
ahead
to
tell
Joseph
that
he
was
on
the
way
to
Goshen
When
they
came
into
the
land
of
Goshen
29
Joseph
had
his
chariot
prepared
and
went
up
to
meet
Israel
his
father
at
Goshen
When
he
presented
himself
to
him
he
at
once
embraced
him
and
wept
for
some
time
30
Then
Israel
said
to
Joseph
Now
I
am
ready
to
die
I
have
seen
your
face
and
know
that
you
are
still
alive
31

said

household
Let
me
go
up
and
report
to
Pharaoh
and
tell
him
My
brothers
and
my
fathers
household
who
were
in
the
land
of
Canaan
have
come
here
to
me
32
The
men
are
shepherds
and
they
raise
livestock
and
they
have
brought
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
all
that
they
have
33
When
Pharaoh
calls
you
and
asks
What
is
your
occupation
34
you
must
say
Your
servants
have
raised
livestock
from
our
youth
until
now
both
we
and
our
forefathers

so
that
you
may
dwell
in
the
land
of
Goshen
for
every
herder
of
sheep
is
detestable
to
the
Egyptians
1
So
Joseph
went
and
reported
to
Pharaoh
My
father
and
my
brothers
and
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
all
that
they
possess
have
come
from
the
land
of
Canaan
and
they
are
in
the
land
of
Goshen
2
He
took
five
of
his
brothers
and
presented
them
to
Pharaoh
3
Pharaoh
said
to
his
brothers
What
is
your
occupation
They
replied
to
Pharaoh
Your
servants
are
herders
of
sheep
both
we
and
our
forefathers
4
Then
they
said
to
Pharaoh
We
have
come
to
reside
as
foreigners
in
the
land
because
there
are
no
pastures
for
the
flock
of
your
servants
for
the
famine
is
severe
in
the
land
of
Canaan
So
please
let
your
servants
dwell
in
the
land
of
Goshen
5
At
that
Pharaoh
said
to
Joseph
Your
father
and
your
brothers
have
come
here
to
you
6
The
land
of
Egypt
is
at
your
disposal
Have
your
father
and
your
brothers
dwell
in
the
very
best
part
of
the
land
Let
them
dwell
in
the
land
of
Goshen
and
if
you
know
of
any
capable
men
among
them
put
them
in
charge
of
my
livestock
7
Then
Joseph
brought
in
Jacob
his
father
and
presented
him
to
Pharaoh
and
Jacob
blessed
Pharaoh
8
Pharaoh
asked
Jacob
How
old
are
you
9
Jacob
said
to
Pharaoh
The
years
of
my
wanderings
are
130
Few
and
distressing
the
years
of
my
life
have
been
and
they
are
not
as
long
as
the
years
of
the
lives
of
my
forefathers
during
their
wanderings
10
After
that
Jacob
blessed
Pharaoh
and
went
out
from
before
him
11
So
Joseph
settled
his
father
and
his
brothers
and
he
gave
them
a
possession
in
the
land
of
Egypt
in
the
very
best
part
of
the
land
in
the
land
of
Rameses
just
as
Pharaoh
had
commanded
12
And
Joseph
kept
supplying
his
father
and
his
brothers
and
the
entire
household
of
his
father
with
food
according
to
the
number
of
their
children
13
Now
there
was
no
food
in
all
the
land
because
the
famine
was
very
severe
and
the
land
of
Egypt
and
the
land
of
Canaan
became
exhausted
as
a
result
of
the
famine
14
Joseph
was
collecting
all
the
money
that
was
to
be
found
in
the
land
of
Egypt
and
in
the
land
of
Canaan
for
the
grain
that
people
were
buying
and
Joseph
kept
bringing
the
money
into
Pharaohs
house
15
In
time
the
money
from
the
land
of
Egypt
and
the
land
of
Canaan
was
spent
and
all
the
Egyptians
began
coming
to
Joseph
saying
Give
us
food
Why
should
we
die
before
your
very
eyes
because
our
money
has
run
out
16
Then
Joseph
said
If
your
money
has
run
out
hand
over
your
livestock
and
I
will
give
you
food
in
exchange
for
your
livestock
17
So
they
began
bringing
their
livestock
to
Joseph
and
Joseph
kept
giving
them
food
in
exchange
for
their
horses
the
livestock
of
the
flock
and
of
the
herd
and
the
donkeys
and
he
kept
providing
them
with
food
in
exchange
for
all
their
livestock
during
that
year
18
When
that
year
came
to
its
close
they
began
coming
to
him
the
next
year
and
saying
We
will
not
hide
from
my
lord
that
the
money
and
the
stock
of
domestic
animals
have
already
been
given
to
my
lord
We
have
nothing
left
for
my
lord
but
our
bodies
and
our
land
19
Why
should
we
die
before
your
eyes
both
we
and
our
land
Buy
us
and
our
land
in
exchange
for
food
and
we
together
with
our
land
will
become
slaves
to
Pharaoh
Give
us
seed
so
that
we
may
live
and
not
die
and
that
our
land
may
not
become
desolate
20
Joseph
then
bought
all
the
land
of
the
Egyptians
for
Pharaoh
because
every
Egyptian
sold
his
field
for
the
famine
was
very
severe
and
the
land
became
Pharaohs
21
Then
he
moved
the
people
into
cities
from
one
end
of
the
territory
of
Egypt
to
its
other
end
22
Only
the
land
of
the
priests
he
did
not
buy
because
the
rations
for
the
priests
were
from
Pharaoh
and
they
lived
on
their
rations
that
Pharaoh
gave
them
That
is
why
they
did
not
sell
their
land
23
Then
Joseph
said
to
the
people
See
I
have
today
bought
you
and
your
land
for
Pharaoh
Here
is
seed
for
you
and
you
must
sow
the
land
with
it
24
When
it
produces
give
a
fifth
to
Pharaoh
but
four
parts
will
be
yours
as
seed
for
the
field
and
as
food
for
you
and
for
those
in
your
houses
and
for
your
children
to
eat
25
So
they
said
You
have
preserved
our
lives
Let
us
find
favor
in
the
eyes
of
my
lord
and
we
will
become
slaves
to
Pharaoh
26
Then
Joseph
made
it
a
decree
which
is
valid
until
today
over
the
land
of
Egypt
that
a
fifth
belongs
to
Pharaoh
It
was
only
the
land
of
the
priests
that
did
not
become
Pharaohs
27
Israel
continued
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
Egypt
in
the
land
of
Goshen
and
they
settled
in
it
and
were
fruitful
and
increased
greatly
28
And
Jacob
lived
on
in
the
land
of
Egypt
for
17
years
so
that
the
days
of
Jacobs
life
came
to
be
147
years
29
The
time
was
approaching
for
Israel
to
die
so
he
called
his
son
Joseph
and
said
If
now
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
place
your
hand
please
under
my
thigh
and
show
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
to
me
Please
do
not
bury
me
in
Egypt
30
When
I
die
you
must
carry
me
out
of
Egypt
and
bury
me
in
the
grave
of
my
forefathers
Accordingly
he
said
I
will
do
just
as
you
say
31
Then
he
said
Swear
to
me
So
he
swore
to
him
At
that
Israel
bowed
down
at
the
head
of
his
bed
1
After
these
things
Joseph
was
told
Look
your
father
is
getting
weak
At
that
he
took
his
two
sons
Manasseh
and
Ephraim
with
him
2
Then
Jacob
was
told
Here
your
son
Joseph
has
come
to
you
So
Israel
gathered
his
strength
and
sat
up
on
his
bed
3
And
Jacob
said
to
Joseph
God
Almighty
appeared
to
me
at
Luz
in
the
land
of
Canaan
and
blessed
me
4
And
he
said
to
me
I
am
making
you
fruitful
and
I
will
make
you
many
and
I
will
transform
you
into
a
congregation
of
peoples
and
I
will
give
this
land
to
your
offspring
after
you
as
a
lasting
possession
5
Now
your
two
sons
who
were
born
to
you
in
the
land
of
Egypt
before
I
came
to
you
in
Egypt
are
mine
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
will
become
mine
just
as
Reuben
and
Simeon
are
mine
6
But
the
children
born
to
you
after
them
will
become
yours
They
will
be
called
by
the
name
of
their
brothers
in
their
inheritance
7
As
for
me
when
I
was
coming
from
Paddan
Rachel
died
alongside
me
in
the
land
of
Canaan
while
there
was
yet
a
good
stretch
of
land
before
coming
to
Ephrath
So
I
buried
her
there
on
the
way
to
Ephrath
that
is
Bethlehem
8
Then
Israel
saw
Josephs
sons
and
asked
Who
are
these
9
So
Joseph
said
to
his
father
They
are
my
sons
whom
God
has
given
me
in
this
place
At
this
he
said
Bring
them
to
me
please
so
that
I
may
bless
them
10
Now
the
eyes
of
Israel
were
failing
from
age
and
he
was
unable
to
see
So
Joseph
brought
them
close
to
him
and
he
kissed
them
and
embraced
them
11
Israel
said
to
Joseph
I
never
imagined
I
would
see
your
face
but
here
God
has
also
let
me
see
your
offspring
12
Joseph
then
removed
them
from
Israels
knees
and
he
bowed
down
with
his
face
to
the
ground
13
Joseph
now
took
the
two
of
them
Ephraim
with
his
right
hand
to
Israels
left
and
Manasseh
with
his
left
hand
to
Israels
right
and
brought
them
close
to
him
14
However
Israel
put
out
his
right
hand
and
placed
it
on
Ephraims
head
although
he
was
the
younger
and
he
placed
his
left
hand
on
Manassehs
head
He
purposely
laid
his
hands
this
way
since
Manasseh
was
the
firstborn
15
Then
he
blessed
Joseph
and
said
The
true
God
before
whom
my
fathers
Abraham
and
Isaac
walked
The
true
God
who
has
been
shepherding
me
during
all
my
life
until
this
day
16
The
angel
who
has
been
recovering
me
from
all
calamity
bless
the
boys
Let
my
name
be
called
upon
them
and
the
name
of
my
fathers
Abraham
and
Isaac
Let
them
increase
to
a
multitude
in
the
earth
17
When
Joseph
saw
that
his
father
kept
his
right
hand
placed
on
Ephraims
head
it
was
displeasing
to
him
so
he
tried
to
take
hold
of
his
fathers
hand
to
move
it
from
Ephraims
head
to
Manassehs
head
18
Joseph
said
to
his
father
Not
so
my
father
because
this
is
the
firstborn
Put
your
right
hand
on
his
head
19
But
his
father
kept
refusing
and
said
I
know
it
my
son
I
know
it
He
too
will
become
a
people
and
he
too
will
become
great
Nevertheless
his
younger
brother
will
become
greater
than
he
will
and
his
offspring
will
become
the
full
equivalent
of
nations
20
So
he
continued
to
bless
them
on
that
day
saying
Let
Israel
mention
you
when
they
pronounce
blessings
saying
May
God
make
you
like
Ephraim
and
like
Manasseh
Thus
he
kept
putting
Ephraim
before
Manasseh
21
Then
Israel
said
to
Joseph
Look
I
am
dying
but
God
will
certainly
continue
with
you
and
return
you
to
the
land
of
your
forefathers
22
As
for
me
I
do
give
you
one
portion
of
land
more
than
to
your
brothers
which
I
took
from
the
hand
of
the
Amorites
with
my
sword
and
my
bow
1
And
Jacob
called
his
sons
and
said
Gather
yourselves
together
that
I
may
tell
you
what
will
happen
to
you
in
the
final
part
of
the
days
2
Assemble
yourselves
and
listen
you
sons
of
Jacob
yes
listen
to
Israel
your
father
3
Reuben
you
are
my
firstborn
my
vigor
and
the
beginning
of
my
procreative
power
the
excellence
of
dignity
and
the
excellence
of
strength
4
With
recklessness
like
turbulent
waters
you
will
not
excel
because
you
have
gone
up
to
your
fathers
bed
At
that
time
you
defiled
my
bed
He
actually
went
on
to
it
5
Simeon
and
Levi
are
brothers
Instruments
of
violence
are
their
slaughter
weapons
6
Into
their
company
do
not
come
O
my
soul
With
their
assembly
do
not
join
O
my
honor
because
in
their
anger
they
killed
men
and
for
their
pleasure
they
hamstrung
bulls
7
Cursed
be
their
anger
because
it
is
cruel
and
their
fury
because
it
is
harsh
Let
me
disperse
them
in
Jacob
and
let
me
scatter
them
in
Israel
8
As
for
you
Judah
your
brothers
will
praise
you
Your
hand
will
be
on
the
neck
of
your
enemies
The
sons
of
your
father
will
bow
down
before
you
9
Judah
is
a
lion
cub
From
the
prey
my
son
you
will
certainly
go
up
He
has
crouched
down
and
stretched
himself
out
like
a
lion
and
like
a
lion
who
dares
rouse
him
10
The
scepter
will
not
depart
from
Judah
neither
the
commanders
staff
from
between
his
feet
until
Shiloh
comes
and
to
him
the
obedience
of
the
peoples
will
belong
11
Tying
his
donkey
to
a
vine
and
his
donkeys
colt
to
a
choice
vine
he
will
wash
his
clothing
in
wine
and
his
garment
in
the
blood
of
grapes
12
Dark
red
are
his
eyes
from
wine
and
his
teeth
are
white
from
milk
13
Zebulun
will
reside
by
the
seashore
by
the
shore
where
the
ships
lie
anchored
and
his
remote
border
will
be
toward
Sidon
14
Issachar
is
a
strong-boned
donkey
lying
down
between
the
two
saddlebags
15
And
he
will
see
that
the
resting-place
is
good
and
that
the
land
is
pleasant
He
will
bend
his
shoulder
to
bear
the
burden
and
will
submit
to
forced
labor
16
Dan
will
judge
his
people
as
one
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
17
Let
Dan
be
a
serpent
by
the
roadside
a
horned
snake
beside
the
path
that
bites
the
heels
of
the
horse
so
that
its
rider
falls
backward
18
I
will
wait
for
salvation
from
you
O
Jehovah
19
As
for
Gad
a
marauder
band
will
raid
him
but
he
will
raid
at
their
heels
20
Ashers
bread
will
be
abundant
and
he
will
provide
food
fit
for
a
king
21
Naphtali
is
a
slender
doe
He
is
speaking
words
of
elegance
22
Joseph
is
the
offshoot
of
a
fruitful
tree
a
fruitful
tree
by
a
spring
whose
branches
extend
over
the
wall
23
But
the
archers
kept
harassing
him
and
shot
at
him
and
kept
harboring
animosity
against
him
24
And
yet
his
bow
remained
in
place
and
his
hands
stayed
strong
and
agile
This
was
from
the
hands
of
the
powerful
one
of
Jacob
from
the
shepherd
the
stone
of
Israel
25
He
is
from
the
God
of
your
father
and
he
will
help
you
and
he
is
with
the
Almighty
and
he
will
bless
you
with
the
blessings
of
the
heavens
above
with
the
blessings
of
the
deep
below
with
the
blessings
of
the
breasts
and
womb
26
The
blessings
of
your
father
will
be
superior
to
the
blessings
of
the
eternal
mountains
to
the
desirable
things
of
the
enduring
hills
They
will
continue
upon
the
head
of
Joseph
upon
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
one
singled
out
from
his
brothers
27
Benjamin
will
keep
on
tearing
like
a
wolf
In
the
morning
he
will
eat
the
prey
and
in
the
evening
he
will
divide
spoil
28
All
of
these
are
the
12
tribes
of
Israel
and
this
is
what
their
father
said
to
them
when
he
was
blessing
them
He
gave
each
of
them
an
appropriate
blessing
29
After
that
he
gave
these
commands
to
them
I
am
being
gathered
to
my
people
Bury
me
with
my
fathers
in
the
cave
that
is
in
the
field
of
Ephron
the
Hittite
30
the
cave
in
the
field
of
Machpelah
in
front
of
Mamre
in
the
land
of
Canaan
the
field
that
Abraham
purchased
from
Ephron
the
Hittite
as
a
property
for
a
burial
place
31
There
they
buried
Abraham
and
his
wife
Sarah
There
they
buried
Isaac
and
his
wife
Rebekah
and
there
I
buried
Leah
32
The
field
and
the
cave
that
is
in
it
were
purchased
from
the
sons
of
Heth
33
Thus
Jacob
finished
giving
these
instructions
to
his
sons
Then
he
drew
his
feet
up
onto
the
bed
and
breathed
his
last
and
was
gathered
to
his
people
1
Joseph
then
threw
himself
on
his
father
and
wept
over
him
and
kissed
him
2
After
that
Joseph
commanded
his
servants
the
physicians
to
embalm
his
father
So
the
physicians
embalmed
Israel
3
and
they
took
the
full
40
days
for
him
for
this
is
the
full
period
for
the
embalming
and
the
Egyptians
continued
to
shed
tears
for
him
70
days
4
When
the
days
of
mourning
for
him
passed
Joseph
spoke
to
Pharaohs
court
saying
If
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
give
this
message
to
Pharaoh
5
My
father
made
me
swear
saying
Look
I
am
dying
You
are
to
bury
me
in
my
burial
place
which
I
have
excavated
in
the
land
of
Canaan
Please
let
me
go
up
and
bury
my
father
after
which
I
will
return
6
Pharaoh
replied
Go
and
bury
your
father
just
as
he
made
you
swear
7
So
Joseph
went
up
to
bury
his
father
and
all
of
Pharaohs
servants
went
with
him
the
elders
of
his
court
and
all
the
elders
of
the
land
of
Egypt
8
and
all
of
Josephs
household
and
his
brothers
and
the
household
of
his
father
Only
their
little
children
and
their
flocks
and
their
herds
they
left
in
the
land
of
Goshen
9
Chariots
and
horsemen
also
went
up
with
him
and
the
camp
was
very
numerous
10
Then
they
came
to
the
threshing
floor
of
Atad
which
is
in
the
region
of
the
Jordan
and
there
they
carried
on
a
very
great
and
bitter
mourning
and
he
kept
mourning
for
his
father
seven
days
11
The
inhabitants
of
the
land
the
Canaanites
saw
them
mourning
at
the
threshing
floor
of
Atad
and
they
exclaimed
This
is
a
great
mourning
for
the
Egyptians
That
is
why
it
was
named
Abel-mizraim
which
is
in
the
region
of
the
Jordan
12
So
his
sons
did
for
him
exactly
as
he
had
instructed
them
13
His
sons
carried
him
into
the
land
of
Canaan
and
buried
him
in
the
cave
of
the
field
of
Machpelah
the
field
in
front
of
Mamre
that
Abraham
had
purchased
from
Ephron
the
Hittite
as
property
for
a
burial
place
14
After
he
buried
his
father
Joseph
returned
to
Egypt
with
his
brothers
and
all
those
who
had
gone
with
him
to
bury
his
father
15
When
Josephs
brothers
saw
that
their
father
was
dead
they
said
It
may
be
that
Joseph
is
harboring
animosity
against
us
and
that
he
will
repay
us
for
all
the
evil
that
we
did
to
him
16
So
they
sent
a
message
to
Joseph
in
these
words
Your
father
gave
this
command
before
his
death
17
This
is
what
you
are
to
say
to
Joseph
I
beg
you
please
pardon
the
transgression
of
your
brothers
and
the
sin
they
committed
in
bringing
such
harm
to
you
Now
please
pardon
the
transgression
of
the
servants
of
your
fathers
God
And
Joseph
wept
when
they
spoke
to
him
18
Then
his
brothers
also
came
and
fell
down
before
him
and
said
Here
we
are
as
slaves
to
you
19
Joseph
said
to
them
Do
not
be
afraid
Am
I
in
the
place
of
God
20
Although
you
meant
to
harm
me
God
intended
it
to
turn
out
well
and
to
preserve
many
people
alive
as
he
is
doing
today
21
So
now
do
not
be
afraid
I
will
keep
supplying
you
and
your
little
children
with
food
Thus
he
comforted
them
and
spoke
reassuringly
to
them
22
And
Joseph
continued
to
dwell
in
Egypt
he
and
the
household
of
his
father
and
Joseph
lived
for
110
years
23
Joseph
saw
the
third
generation
of
Ephraims
sons
also
the
sons
of
Machir
Manassehs
son
They
were
born
upon
Josephs
knees
24
At
length
Joseph
said
to
his
brothers
I
am
dying
but
God
will
without
fail
turn
his
attention
to
you
and
he
will
certainly
bring
you
up
out
of
this
land
to
the
land
about
which
he
swore
to
Abraham
to
Isaac
and
to
Jacob
25
So
Joseph
made
the
sons
of
Israel
swear
saying
God
will
without
fail
turn
his
attention
to
you
You
must
take
my
bones
up
out
of
here
26
And
Joseph
died
at
the
age
of
110
and
they
had
him
embalmed
and
he
was
put
in
a
coffin
in
Egypt
1
Now
these
are
the
names
of
Israels
sons
who
came
into
Egypt
with
Jacob
each
man
who
came
with
his
household
2
Reuben
Simeon
Levi
and
Judah
3
Issachar
Zebulun
and
Benjamin
4
Dan
and
Naphtali
Gad
and
Asher
5
And
all
those
who
were
born
to
Jacob
were
70
people
but
Joseph
was
already
in
Egypt
6
Joseph
eventually
died
and
also
all
his
brothers
and
all
that
generation
7
And
the
Israelites
became
fruitful
and
began
to
increase
greatly
and
they
kept
on
multiplying
and
growing
mightier
at
an
extraordinary
rate
so
that
the
land
became
filled
with
them
8
In
time
there
arose
over
Egypt
a
new
king
one
who
did
not
know
Joseph
9
So
he
said
to
his
people
Look
The
people
of
Israel
are
more
numerous
and
mightier
than
we
are
10
Let
us
deal
shrewdly
with
them
Otherwise
they
will
continue
to
multiply
and
if
a
war
breaks
out
they
will
join
our
enemies
and
fight
against
us
and
leave
the
country
11
So
they
appointed
chiefs
of
forced
labor
over
them
to
oppress
them
with
hard
labor
and
they
built
storage
cities
for
Pharaoh
namely
Pithom
and
Raamses
12
But
the
more
they
would
oppress
them
the
more
they
would
multiply
and
the
more
they
kept
spreading
out
so
they
felt
sick
with
fear
because
of
the
Israelites
13
Consequently
the
Egyptians
forced
the
Israelites
into
harsh
slavery
14
They
made
their
life
bitter
with
hard
labor
as
they
worked
with
clay
mortar
and
bricks
and
in
every
form
of
slavery
in
the
field
Yes
they
made
them
toil
in
harsh
conditions
in
every
form
of
slavery
15
Later
the
king
of
Egypt
spoke
to
the
Hebrew
midwives
whose
names
were
Shiphrah
and
Puah
16
and
he
told
them
When
you
help
the
Hebrew
women
to
give
birth
and
you
see
them
on
the
stool
for
childbirth
you
must
put
the
child
to
death
if
it
is
a
son
but
if
it
is
a
daughter
she
must
live
17
However
the
midwives
feared
the
true
God
and
they
did
not
do
what
the
king
of
Egypt
told
them
Instead
they
would
keep
the
male
children
alive
18
In
time
the
king
of
Egypt
called
the
midwives
and
said
to
them
Why
have
you
kept
the
male
children
alive
19
The
midwives
said
to
Pharaoh
The
Hebrew
women
are
not
like
the
Egyptian
women
They
are
lively
and
have
already
given
birth
before
the
midwife
can
come
in
to
them
20
So
God
dealt
well
with
the
midwives
and
the
people
kept
increasing
and
becoming
very
mighty
21
And
because
the
midwives
had
feared
the
true
God
he
later
gave
them
families
22
Finally
Pharaoh
commanded
all
his
people
You
are
to
throw
every
newborn
son
of
the
Hebrews
into
the
Nile
River
but
you
are
to
keep
every
daughter
alive
1
About
that
time
a
certain
man
of
the
house
of
Levi
married
a
daughter
of
Levi
2
And
the
woman
became
pregnant
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
When
she
saw
how
beautiful
he
was
she
kept
him
concealed
for
three
months
3
When
she
was
no
longer
able
to
conceal
him
she
took
a
papyrus
basket
and
coated
it
with
bitumen
and
pitch
and
put
the
child
in
it
and
placed
it
among
the
reeds
by
the
bank
of
the
Nile
River
4
But
his
sister
stood
at
a
distance
to
see
what
would
happen
to
him
5
When
Pharaohs
daughter
came
down
to
bathe
in
the
Nile
her
female
attendants
were
walking
by
the
side
of
the
Nile
And
she
caught
sight
of
the
basket
in
the
middle
of
the
reeds
She
immediately
sent
her
slave
girl
to
get
it
6
When
she
opened
it
she
saw
the
child
and
the
boy
was
crying
She
felt
compassion
for
him
but
she
said
This
is
one
of
the
children
of
the
Hebrews
7
Then
his
sister
said
to
Pharaohs
daughter
Shall
I
go
and
call
a
nursing
woman
from
the
Hebrews
to
nurse
the
child
for
you
8
Pharaohs
daughter
said
to
her
Go
At
once
the
girl
went
and
called
the
childs
mother
9
Pharaohs
daughter
then
said
to
her
Take
this
child
with
you
and
nurse
him
for
me
and
I
will
pay
you
So
the
woman
took
the
child
and
nursed
him
10
When
the
child
grew
older
she
brought
him
to
Pharaohs
daughter
and
he
became
a
son
to
her
She
named
him
Moses
and
said
It
is
because
I
have
drawn
him
out
of
the
water
11
Now
in
those
days
after
Moses
had
become
an
adult
he
went
out
to
his
brothers
to
look
at
the
burdens
they
were
bearing
and
he
caught
sight
of
an
Egyptian
beating
a
Hebrew
one
of
his
brothers
12
So
he
looked
this
way
and
that
and
seeing
no
one
he
killed
the
Egyptian
and
hid
him
in
the
sand
13
But
he
went
out
on
the
following
day
and
there
were
two
Hebrew
men
fighting
with
each
other
So
he
said
to
the
one
in
the
wrong
Why
do
you
strike
your
companion
14
At
this
he
said
Who
appointed
you
as
a
prince
and
a
judge
over
us
Are
you
planning
to
kill
me
just
as
you
killed
the
Egyptian
Moses
now
was
afraid
and
said
Surely
the
matter
has
become
known
15
Then
Pharaoh
heard
about
it
and
he
attempted
to
kill
Moses
but
Moses
ran
away
from
Pharaoh
and
went
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
Midian
and
he
sat
down
by
a
well
16
Now
the
priest
of
Midian
had
seven
daughters
and
these
came
to
draw
water
and
to
fill
the
troughs
to
water
their
fathers
flock
17
But
as
usual
the
shepherds
came
and
drove
them
away
At
this
Moses
got
up
and
helped
the
women
and
watered
their
flock
18
When
they
came
home
to
their
father
Reuel
he
exclaimed
How
is
it
that
you
have
come
home
so
quickly
today
19
They
replied
A
certain
Egyptian
rescued
us
from
the
shepherds
and
he
even
drew
water
for
us
and
watered
the
flock
20
He
said
to
his
daughters
But
where
is
he
Why
did
you
leave
the
man
behind
Call
him
so
that
he
may
eat
with
us
21
After
that
Moses
consented
to
stay
with
the
man
and
he
gave
his
daughter
Zipporah
to
Moses
in
marriage
22
Later
she
bore
a
son
and
he
named
him
Gershom
for
he
said
I
have
become
a
foreign
resident
in
a
foreign
land
23
After
a
long
time
the
king
of
Egypt
died
but
the
Israelites
continued
to
groan
because
of
the
slavery
and
to
cry
out
in
complaint
and
their
cry
for
help
because
of
the
slavery
kept
going
up
to
the
true
God
24
In
time
God
heard
their
groaning
and
God
remembered
his
covenant
with
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
25
So
God
looked
on
the
Israelites
and
God
took
notice
1
Moses
became
a
shepherd
of
the
flock
of
his
father-in-law
Jethro
the
priest
of
Midian
While
he
was
leading
the
flock
to
the
west
side
of
the
wilderness
he
eventually
came
to
the
mountain
of
the
true
God
to
Horeb
2
Then
Jehovahs
angel
appeared
to
him
in
a
flame
of
fire
in
the
midst
of
a
thornbush
As
he
kept
looking
he
saw
that
the
thornbush
was
on
fire
and
yet
the
thornbush
was
not
consumed
3
So
Moses
said
I
will
go
over
to
inspect
this
unusual
sight
to
see
why
the
thornbush
does
not
burn
up
4
When
Jehovah
saw
that
he
went
over
to
look
God
called
to
him
out
of
the
thornbush
and
said
Moses
Moses
to
which
he
said
Here
I
am
5
Then
he
said
Do
not
come
any
nearer
Remove
your
sandals
from
your
feet
because
the
place
where
you
are
standing
is
holy
ground
6
He
went
on
to
say
I
am
the
God
of
your
father
the
God
of
Abraham
the
God
of
Isaac
and
the
God
of
Jacob
Then
Moses
hid
his
face
because
he
was
afraid
to
look
at
the
true
God
7
Jehovah
added
I
have
certainly
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people
who
are
in
Egypt
and
I
have
heard
their
outcry
because
of
those
who
force
them
to
work
I
well
know
the
pains
they
suffer
8
I
will
go
down
to
rescue
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians
and
to
bring
them
up
out
of
that
land
to
a
land
good
and
spacious
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
the
territory
of
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Amorites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
9
Now
look
The
outcry
of
the
people
of
Israel
has
reached
me
and
I
have
seen
also
the
harsh
way
that
the
Egyptians
are
oppressing
them
10
Now
come
I
will
send
you
to
Pharaoh
and
you
will
bring
my
people
the
Israelites
out
of
Egypt
11
However
Moses
said
to
the
true
God
Who
am
I
that
I
should
go
to
Pharaoh
and
bring
the
Israelites
out
of
Egypt
12
To
this
he
said
I
will
prove
to
be
with
you
and
this
is
the
sign
for
you
that
it
was
I
who
sent
you
After
you
have
brought
the
people
out
of
Egypt
you
people
will
serve
the
true
God
on
this
mountain
13
But
Moses
said
to
the
true
God
Suppose
I
go
to
the
Israelites
and
say
to
them
The
God
of
your
forefathers
has
sent
me
to
you

and
they
say
to
me
What
is
his
name
What
should
I
say
to
them
14
So
God
said
to
Moses
I
Will
Become
What
I
Choose
to
Become
And
he
added
This
is
what
you
are
to
say
to
the
Israelites
I
Will
Become
has
sent
me
to
you
15
Then
God
said
once
more
to
Moses
This
is
what
you
are
to
say
to
the
Israelites
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
the
God
of
Abraham
the
God
of
Isaac
and
the
God
of
Jacob
has
sent
me
to
you
This
is
my
name
forever
and
this
is
how
I
am
to
be
remembered
from
generation
to
generation
16
Now
go
and
gather
the
elders
of
Israel
and
say
to
them
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
has
appeared
to
me
the
God
of
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
and
he
said
I
have
certainly
taken
notice
of
you
and
of
what
is
being
done
to
you
in
Egypt
17
So
I
say
I
will
take
you
away
from
affliction
at
the
hands
of
the
Egyptians
to
the
land
of
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Amorites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
to
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
18
They
will
certainly
listen
to
your
voice
and
you
will
go
you
and
the
elders
of
Israel
to
the
king
of
Egypt
and
you
men
should
say
to
him
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
Hebrews
has
communicated
with
us
So
please
let
us
make
a
three-day
journey
into
the
wilderness
so
that
we
may
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
our
God
19
But
I
myself
well
know
that
the
king
of
Egypt
will
not
give
you
permission
to
go
unless
a
mighty
hand
compels
him
20
So
I
will
have
to
stretch
out
my
hand
and
strike
Egypt
with
all
my
extraordinary
acts
that
I
will
do
in
it
and
after
that
he
will
send
you
out
21
And
I
will
give
this
people
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
Egyptians
and
when
you
go
you
will
by
no
means
go
empty-handed
22
Each
woman
must
ask
her
neighbor
and
the
woman
lodging
in
her
house
for
articles
of
silver
and
of
gold
as
well
as
clothing
and
you
will
put
them
on
your
sons
and
your
daughters
and
you
will
plunder
the
Egyptians
1
However
Moses
answered
But
suppose
they
do
not
believe
me
and
do
not
listen
to
my
voice
for
they
will
say
Jehovah
did
not
appear
to
you
2
Then
Jehovah
said
to
him
What
is
that
in
your
hand
He
answered
A
rod
3
He
said
Throw
it
on
the
ground
So
he
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
it
became
a
serpent
and
Moses
fled
from
it
4
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Reach
out
your
hand
and
seize
it
by
the
tail
So
he
reached
out
and
seized
it
and
it
became
a
rod
in
his
hand
5
God
then
said
This
is
so
that
they
may
believe
that
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
the
God
of
Abraham
the
God
of
Isaac
and
the
God
of
Jacob
has
appeared
to
you
6
Jehovah
said
to
him
once
more
Put
your
hand
please
into
the
upper
fold
of
your
garment
So
he
put
his
hand
into
the
fold
of
his
garment
When
he
drew
it
out
why
his
hand
was
stricken
with
leprosy
like
snow
7
Then
he
said
Return
your
hand
into
the
upper
fold
of
your
garment
So
he
returned
his
hand
into
his
garment
When
he
drew
it
out
of
the
garment
it
was
restored
like
the
rest
of
his
flesh
8
He
said
If
they
will
not
believe
you
or
pay
attention
to
the
first
sign
then
they
will
certainly
heed
the
next
sign
9
Still
even
if
they
will
not
believe
these
two
signs
and
refuse
to
listen
to
your
voice
you
will
take
some
water
from
the
Nile
River
and
pour
it
out
on
the
dry
land
and
the
water
that
you
take
from
the
Nile
will
become
blood
on
the
dry
land
10
Moses
now
said
to
Jehovah
Pardon
me
Jehovah
but
I
have
never
been
a
fluent
speaker
neither
in
the
past
nor
since
you
have
spoken
to
your
servant
for
I
am
slow
of
speech
and
slow
of
tongue
11
Jehovah
said
to
him
Who
made
a
mouth
for
man
or
who
makes
them
speechless
deaf
clear-sighted
or
blind
Is
it
not
I
Jehovah
12
So
go
now
and
I
will
be
with
you
as
you
speak
and
I
will
teach
you
what
you
should
say
13
But
he
said
Pardon
me
Jehovah
please
send
anyone
whom
you
want
to
send
14
Then
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
Moses
and
he
said
What
about
your
brother
Aaron
the
Levite
I
know
that
he
can
speak
very
well
And
he
is
now
on
his
way
here
to
meet
you
When
he
sees
you
his
heart
will
rejoice
15
So
you
must
speak
to
him
and
put
the
words
in
his
mouth
and
I
will
be
with
you
and
him
as
you
speak
and
I
will
teach
you
men
what
to
do
16
He
will
speak
for
you
to
the
people
and
he
will
be
your
spokesman
and
you
will
serve
as
God
to
him
17
And
you
will
take
this
rod
in
your
hand
and
perform
the
signs
with
it
18
So
Moses
went
back
to
Jethro
his
father-in-law
and
said
to
him
I
want
to
go
please
and
return
to
my
brothers
who
are
in
Egypt
to
see
whether
they
are
still
alive
Jethro
said
to
Moses
Go
in
peace
19
After
that
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
in
Midian
Go
return
to
Egypt
because
all
the
men
who
were
seeking
to
kill
you
are
dead
20
Then
Moses
took
his
wife
and
his
sons
and
lifted
them
onto
a
donkey
and
he
started
back
to
the
land
of
Egypt
Moreover
Moses
took
the
rod
of
the
true
God
in
his
hand
21
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
After
you
have
returned
to
Egypt
see
that
you
perform
before
Pharaoh
all
the
miracles
that
I
have
empowered
you
to
do
But
I
will
allow
his
heart
to
become
obstinate
and
he
will
not
send
the
people
away
22
You
must
say
to
Pharaoh
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Israel
is
my
son
my
firstborn
23
I
say
to
you
Send
my
son
away
so
that
he
may
serve
me
But
if
you
refuse
to
send
him
away
I
am
going
to
kill
your
son
your
firstborn
24
Now
on
the
road
at
the
lodging
place
Jehovah
met
him
and
was
seeking
to
put
him
to
death
25
Finally
Zipporah
took
a
flint
and
circumcised
her
son
and
caused
his
foreskin
to
touch
his
feet
and
said
It
is
because
you
are
a
bridegroom
of
blood
to
me
26
So
He
let
him
go
At
that
time
she
said
a
bridegroom
of
blood

because
of
the
circumcision
27
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Aaron
Go
into
the
wilderness
to
meet
Moses
So
he
went
and
met
him
at
the
mountain
of
the
true
God
and
greeted
him
with
a
kiss
28
And
Moses
told
Aaron
all
the
words
of
Jehovah
who
had
sent
him
and
all
the
signs
that
He
had
commanded
him
to
do
29
After
that
Moses
and
Aaron
went
and
gathered
all
the
elders
of
the
Israelites
30
Aaron
told
them
all
the
words
that
Jehovah
had
spoken
to
Moses
and
he
performed
the
signs
before
the
eyes
of
the
people
31
At
this
the
people
believed
When
they
heard
that
Jehovah
had
turned
his
attention
to
the
Israelites
and
that
he
had
seen
their
affliction
they
bowed
down
and
prostrated
themselves
1
Afterward
Moses
and
Aaron
went
in
and
said
to
Pharaoh
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Send
my
people
away
so
that
they
may
celebrate
a
festival
to
me
in
the
wilderness
2
But
Pharaoh
said
Who
is
Jehovah
that
I
should
obey
his
voice
to
send
Israel
away
I
do
not
know
Jehovah
at
all
and
what
is
more
I
will
not
send
Israel
away
3
But
they
said
The
God
of
the
Hebrews
has
communicated
with
us
Please
we
want
to
make
a
three-day
journey
into
the
wilderness
and
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
our
God
otherwise
he
will
strike
us
with
disease
or
with
the
sword
4
The
king
of
Egypt
replied
to
them
Why
is
it
Moses
and
Aaron
that
you
are
taking
the
people
away
from
their
work
Return
to
your
labor
5
And
Pharaoh
continued
Look
at
how
many
people
of
the
land
there
are
and
you
would
have
them
rest
from
their
labor
6
That
same
day
Pharaoh
commanded
the
taskmasters
and
their
foremen
7
You
must
no
longer
give
straw
to
the
people
to
make
bricks
Let
them
go
and
gather
straw
for
themselves
8
But
you
must
still
impose
on
them
the
same
quota
of
bricks
as
they
made
in
the
past
Do
not
reduce
it
for
them
for
they
are
relaxing
That
is
why
they
are
crying
out
We
want
to
go
we
want
to
sacrifice
to
our
God
9
Make
them
work
harder
and
keep
them
busy
so
that
they
will
not
pay
attention
to
lies
10
So
the
taskmasters
and
their
foremen
went
out
and
said
to
the
people
Here
is
what
Pharaoh
has
said
I
am
giving
you
no
more
straw
11
Go
and
get
your
own
straw
for
yourselves
wherever
you
can
find
it
but
your
work
will
not
be
reduced
at
all
12
Then
the
people
scattered
throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt
to
gather
stubble
for
straw
13
And
the
taskmasters
kept
urging
them
You
must
each
finish
your
work
every
day
just
as
when
straw
was
provided
14
Also
the
foremen
of
the
Israelites
whom
Pharaohs
taskmasters
had
appointed
over
them
were
beaten
They
asked
them
Why
did
you
not
reach
the
quota
of
bricks
that
you
used
to
make
It
happened
both
yesterday
and
today
15
So
the
foremen
of
the
Israelites
went
in
and
complained
to
Pharaoh
Why
are
you
treating
your
servants
this
way
16
No
straw
is
given
to
your
servants
yet
they
are
saying
to
us
Make
bricks
Your
servants
are
beaten
but
your
own
people
are
at
fault
17
But
he
said
You
are
relaxing
you
are
relaxing
That
is
why
you
are
saying
We
want
to
go
we
want
to
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
18
So
now
go
get
back
to
work
No
straw
will
be
given
to
you
but
you
must
still
produce
your
quota
of
bricks
19
Then
the
foremen
of
the
Israelites
saw
that
they
were
in
serious
trouble
because
of
the
order
You
must
not
reduce
your
daily
quota
of
bricks
at
all
20
After
that
they
met
up
with
Moses
and
Aaron
who
were
standing
there
to
meet
them
as
they
came
out
from
Pharaoh
21
At
once
they
said
to
them
May
Jehovah
look
upon
you
and
judge
since
you
have
made
Pharaoh
and
his
servants
despise
us
and
you
have
put
a
sword
in
their
hand
to
kill
us
22
Then
Moses
turned
to
Jehovah
and
said
Jehovah
why
have
you
afflicted
this
people
Why
have
you
sent
me
23
From
the
time
that
I
went
in
before
Pharaoh
to
speak
in
your
name
he
has
dealt
worse
with
this
people
and
you
have
certainly
not
rescued
your
people
1
So
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Now
you
will
see
what
I
will
do
to
Pharaoh
A
mighty
hand
will
force
him
to
send
them
away
and
a
mighty
hand
will
force
him
to
drive
them
out
of
his
land
2
Then
God
said
to
Moses
I
am
Jehovah
3
And
I
used
to
appear
to
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
as
God
Almighty
but
with
regard
to
my
name
Jehovah
I
did
not
make
myself
known
to
them
4
I
also
established
my
covenant
with
them
to
give
them
the
land
of
Canaan
the
land
in
which
they
lived
as
foreigners
5
Now
I
myself
have
heard
the
groaning
of
the
people
of
Israel
whom
the
Egyptians
are
enslaving
and
I
remember
my
covenant
6
Therefore
say
to
the
Israelites
I
am
Jehovah
and
I
will
bring
you
out
from
under
the
burdens
of
the
Egyptians
and
rescue
you
from
their
slavery
and
I
will
reclaim
you
with
an
outstretched
arm
and
with
great
judgments
7
And
I
will
take
you
in
as
my
people
and
I
will
be
your
God
and
you
will
certainly
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
who
is
bringing
you
out
from
under
the
burdens
of
Egypt
8
And
I
will
bring
you
into
the
land
that
I
swore
with
an
oath
to
give
to
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
and
I
will
give
it
to
you
as
something
to
possess
I
am
Jehovah
9
Moses
later
gave
this
message
to
the
Israelites
but
they
did
not
listen
to
Moses
because
of
their
discouragement
and
because
of
the
harsh
slavery
10
Then
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
saying
11
Go
in
and
tell
Pharaoh
Egypts
king
that
he
should
send
the
Israelites
away
out
of
his
land
12
However
Moses
replied
to
Jehovah
Look
The
Israelites
have
not
listened
to
me
how
will
Pharaoh
ever
listen
to
me
as
I
speak
with
difficulty
13
But
Jehovah
again
told
Moses
and
Aaron
what
commands
to
give
to
the
Israelites
and
to
Pharaoh
Egypts
king
in
order
to
bring
the
Israelites
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
14
These
are
the
heads
of
the
house
of
their
fathers
The
sons
of
Reuben
Israels
firstborn
were
Hanoch
Pallu
Hezron
and
Carmi
These
are
the
families
of
Reuben
15
The
sons
of
Simeon
were
Jemuel
Jamin
Ohad
Jachin
Zohar
and
Shaul
the
son
of
a
Canaanite
woman
These
are
the
families
of
Simeon
16
These
are
the
names
of
the
sons
of
Levi
according
to
their
family
descents
Gershon
Kohath
and
Merari
The
length
of
Levis
life
was
137
years
17
The
sons
of
Gershon
were
Libni
and
Shimei
according
to
their
families
18
The
sons
of
Kohath
were
Amram
Izhar
Hebron
and
Uzziel
The
length
of
Kohaths
life
was
133
years
19
The
sons
of
Merari
were
Mahli
and
Mushi
These
were
the
families
of
the
Levites
according
to
their
family
descents
20
Now
Amram
took
Jochebed
his
fathers
sister
as
his
wife
She
bore
him
Aaron
and
Moses
The
length
of
Amrams
life
was
137
years
21
The
sons
of
Izhar
were
Korah
Nepheg
and
Zichri
22
The
sons
of
Uzziel
were
Mishael
Elzaphan
and
Sithri
23
Now
Aaron
took
Elisheba
Amminadabs
daughter
the
sister
of
Nahshon
as
his
wife
She
bore
him
Nadab
Abihu
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
24
The
sons
of
Korah
were
Assir
Elkanah
and
Abiasaph
These
were
the
families
of
the
Korahites
25
Eleazar
Aarons
son
took
one
of
the
daughters
of
Putiel
as
his
wife
She
bore
him
Phinehas
These
are
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
Levites
according
to
their
families
26
This
is
the
Aaron
and
Moses
to
whom
Jehovah
said
Bring
the
people
of
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
company
by
company
27
It
was
they
who
spoke
to
Pharaoh
Egypts
king
to
bring
the
people
of
Israel
out
of
Egypt
It
was
this
Moses
and
Aaron
28
On
that
day
when
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
in
the
land
of
Egypt
29
Jehovah
told
Moses
I
am
Jehovah
Speak
to
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
everything
I
am
speaking
to
you
30
Then
Moses
said
before
Jehovah
Look
I
speak
with
difficulty
so
how
will
Pharaoh
ever
listen
to
me
1
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
See
I
have
made
you
like
God
to
Pharaoh
and
Aaron
your
own
brother
will
become
your
prophet
2
You
are
to
repeat
everything
that
I
will
command
you
and
Aaron
your
brother
will
speak
to
Pharaoh
and
he
will
send
the
Israelites
away
from
his
land
3
As
for
me
I
will
allow
Pharaohs
heart
to
become
obstinate
and
I
will
multiply
my
signs
and
my
miracles
in
the
land
of
Egypt
4
But
Pharaoh
will
not
listen
to
you
and
I
will
lay
my
hand
upon
Egypt
and
bring
my
multitudes
my
people
the
Israelites
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
great
judgments
5
And
the
Egyptians
will
certainly
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
stretch
out
my
hand
against
Egypt
and
bring
the
Israelites
out
from
among
them
6
Moses
and
Aaron
did
what
Jehovah
had
commanded
them
they
did
just
so
7
Moses
was
80
years
old
and
Aaron
was
83
years
old
when
they
spoke
to
Pharaoh
8
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
9
If
Pharaoh
says
to
you
Perform
a
miracle

then
tell
Aaron
Take
your
rod
and
throw
it
down
before
Pharaoh
It
will
become
a
big
snake
10
So
Moses
and
Aaron
went
in
to
Pharaoh
and
did
exactly
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Aaron
threw
his
rod
down
before
Pharaoh
and
his
servants
and
it
became
a
big
snake
11
However
Pharaoh
summoned
the
wise
men
and
the
sorcerers
and
the
magic-practicing
priests
of
Egypt
also
did
the
same
thing
with
their
magic
12
Each
one
threw
down
his
rod
and
they
became
big
snakes
but
Aarons
rod
swallowed
up
their
rods
13
Still
Pharaohs
heart
became
obstinate
and
he
did
not
listen
to
them
just
as
Jehovah
had
said
14
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Pharaohs
heart
is
unresponsive
He
has
refused
to
send
the
people
away
15
Go
to
Pharaoh
in
the
morning
Look
He
is
going
out
to
the
water
And
you
should
station
yourself
to
meet
him
by
the
edge
of
the
Nile
River
and
take
with
you
in
your
hand
the
rod
that
turned
into
a
serpent
16
And
you
must
say
to
him
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
Hebrews
has
sent
me
to
you
and
he
says
Send
my
people
away
so
that
they
may
serve
me
in
the
wilderness

but
you
have
not
obeyed
until
now
17
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
By
this
you
will
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
Here
I
am
striking
the
water
that
is
in
the
Nile
River
with
the
rod
that
is
in
my
hand
and
it
will
turn
into
blood
18
And
the
fish
that
are
in
the
Nile
will
die
and
the
Nile
will
stink
and
the
Egyptians
will
find
it
impossible
to
drink
water
from
the
Nile
19
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Say
to
Aaron
Take
your
rod
and
stretch
out
your
hand
over
the
waters
of
Egypt
over
its
rivers
over
its
canals
over
its
marshes
and
over
all
its
reservoirs
that
they
may
become
blood
There
will
be
blood
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
even
in
the
wooden
and
stone
containers
20
Immediately
Moses
and
Aaron
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
He
lifted
up
the
rod
and
struck
the
water
that
was
in
the
Nile
River
before
the
eyes
of
Pharaoh
and
his
servants
and
all
the
water
that
was
in
the
river
was
turned
into
blood
21
And
the
fish
that
were
in
the
river
died
and
the
river
began
to
stink
and
the
Egyptians
were
unable
to
drink
water
from
the
Nile
and
there
was
blood
throughout
the
land
of
Egypt
22
Nevertheless
the
magic-practicing
priests
of
Egypt
did
the
same
thing
with
their
secret
arts
so
that
Pharaohs
heart
continued
to
be
obstinate
and
he
did
not
listen
to
them
just
as
Jehovah
had
said
23
Then
Pharaoh
returned
to
his
house
and
he
did
not
take
this
to
heart
either
24
So
all
the
Egyptians
were
digging
all
around
the
Nile
for
water
to
drink
because
they
could
not
drink
any
water
of
the
Nile
25
And
seven
full
days
passed
after
Jehovah
struck
the
Nile
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Go
in
to
Pharaoh
and
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Send
my
people
away
so
that
they
may
serve
me
2
If
you
keep
refusing
to
send
them
away
I
will
plague
all
your
territory
with
frogs
3
And
the
Nile
River
will
swarm
with
frogs
and
they
will
come
up
and
enter
into
your
house
into
your
bedroom
on
your
bed
into
the
houses
of
your
servants
and
on
your
people
into
your
ovens
and
into
your
kneading
troughs
4
On
you
on
your
people
and
on
all
your
servants
the
frogs
will
come
up
5
Jehovah
later
said
to
Moses
Say
to
Aaron
Stretch
out
your
hand
with
your
rod
over
the
rivers
the
Nile
canals
and
the
marshes
and
make
the
frogs
come
up
over
the
land
of
Egypt
6
So
Aaron
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
waters
of
Egypt
and
the
frogs
began
to
come
up
and
to
cover
the
land
of
Egypt
7
However
the
magic-practicing
priests
did
the
same
thing
by
their
secret
arts
and
they
too
made
the
frogs
come
up
over
the
land
of
Egypt
8
Pharaoh
then
called
Moses
and
Aaron
and
said
Plead
with
Jehovah
to
remove
the
frogs
from
me
and
my
people
as
I
want
to
send
the
people
away
so
that
they
may
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
9
Then
Moses
said
to
Pharaoh
I
leave
to
you
the
honor
of
telling
me
when
I
should
plead
to
have
the
frogs
removed
from
you
your
servants
your
people
and
your
houses
Only
in
the
Nile
River
will
they
be
left
10
To
this
he
said
Tomorrow
So
he
said
It
will
be
according
to
your
word
so
that
you
may
know
that
there
is
no
one
else
like
Jehovah
our
God
11
The
frogs
will
depart
from
you
your
houses
your
servants
and
your
people
They
will
be
left
only
in
the
Nile
12
So
Moses
and
Aaron
went
out
from
Pharaoh
and
Moses
pleaded
with
Jehovah
about
the
frogs
that
He
had
brought
upon
Pharaoh
13
Then
Jehovah
did
as
Moses
asked
and
the
frogs
began
to
die
in
the
houses
the
courtyards
and
the
fields
14
They
were
piling
them
up
in
countless
heaps
and
the
land
began
to
stink
15
When
Pharaoh
saw
that
there
was
relief
he
hardened
his
heart
and
he
refused
to
listen
to
them
just
as
Jehovah
had
said
16
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Say
to
Aaron
Stretch
out
your
rod
and
strike
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
it
must
become
gnats
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
17
And
they
did
this
Aaron
stretched
out
his
hand
with
his
rod
and
struck
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
the
gnats
came
on
man
and
beast
All
the
dust
of
the
earth
became
gnats
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
18
The
magic-practicing
priests
tried
to
do
the
same
and
produce
gnats
by
their
secret
arts
but
they
could
not
And
the
gnats
came
on
man
and
beast
19
So
the
magic-practicing
priests
said
to
Pharaoh
It
is
the
finger
of
God
But
Pharaohs
heart
continued
to
be
obstinate
and
he
did
not
listen
to
them
just
as
Jehovah
had
said
20
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
station
yourself
in
front
of
Pharaoh
Look
He
is
coming
out
to
the
water
And
you
must
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
said
Send
my
people
away
so
that
they
may
serve
me
21
But
if
you
do
not
send
my
people
away
I
will
send
on
you
your
servants
and
your
people
and
into
your
houses
the
gadfly
and
the
houses
of
Egypt
will
be
full
of
gadflies
and
they
will
even
cover
the
ground
they
stand
on
22
On
that
day
I
will
certainly
set
apart
the
land
of
Goshen
where
my
people
are
dwelling
No
gadflies
will
exist
there
and
by
this
you
will
know
that
I
Jehovah
am
here
in
the
land
23
And
I
will
make
a
distinction
between
my
people
and
your
people
Tomorrow
this
sign
will
take
place
24
And
Jehovah
did
so
and
heavy
swarms
of
gadflies
began
to
invade
the
house
of
Pharaoh
and
the
houses
of
his
servants
and
all
the
land
of
Egypt
The
land
was
ruined
by
the
gadflies
25
Finally
Pharaoh
called
Moses
and
Aaron
and
said
Go
sacrifice
to
your
God
in
the
land
26
But
Moses
said
It
is
not
proper
to
do
so
because
what
we
would
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
our
God
would
be
detestable
to
the
Egyptians
If
we
would
make
a
sacrifice
that
was
detestable
to
the
Egyptians
right
before
their
eyes
would
they
not
stone
us
27
We
will
make
a
three-day
journey
into
the
wilderness
and
there
we
will
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
our
God
just
as
he
has
said
to
us
28
Pharaoh
now
said
I
will
send
you
away
to
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
your
God
in
the
wilderness
Only
you
must
not
go
so
far
away
Plead
in
my
behalf
29
Then
Moses
said
Now
I
am
going
away
from
you
and
I
will
plead
with
Jehovah
and
the
gadflies
will
depart
from
Pharaoh
his
servants
and
his
people
tomorrow
But
Pharaoh
must
stop
trifling
with
us
by
refusing
to
send
the
people
away
to
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
30
Moses
then
went
out
from
Pharaoh
and
pleaded
with
Jehovah
31
So
Jehovah
did
according
to
Moses
word
and
the
gadflies
departed
from
Pharaoh
his
servants
and
his
people
Not
one
was
left
32
However
Pharaoh
again
hardened
his
heart
and
did
not
send
the
people
away
1
So
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Go
in
to
Pharaoh
and
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
Hebrews
has
said
Send
my
people
away
so
that
they
may
serve
me
2
But
if
you
refuse
to
send
them
away
and
you
keep
holding
them
3
look
Jehovahs
hand
will
come
against
your
livestock
in
the
field
On
the
horses
the
donkeys
the
camels
the
herd
and
the
flock
there
will
be
a
devastating
plague
4
And
Jehovah
will
certainly
make
a
distinction
between
the
livestock
of
Israel
and
the
livestock
of
Egypt
and
nothing
that
belongs
to
the
Israelites
will
die
5
Moreover
Jehovah
set
an
appointed
time
saying
Tomorrow
Jehovah
will
do
this
in
the
land
6
And
Jehovah
did
this
on
the
very
next
day
and
all
sorts
of
livestock
of
Egypt
began
to
die
but
not
one
of
Israels
livestock
died
7
When
Pharaoh
inquired
look
not
so
much
as
one
of
Israels
livestock
had
died
Nevertheless
Pharaohs
heart
continued
to
be
unresponsive
and
he
did
not
send
the
people
away
8
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
Fill
both
of
your
hands
with
soot
from
a
kiln
and
Moses
must
throw
it
into
the
air
in
front
of
Pharaoh
9
And
it
will
become
a
fine
dust
on
all
the
land
of
Egypt
and
it
will
become
festering
boils
on
man
and
beast
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
10
So
they
took
soot
from
a
kiln
and
stood
before
Pharaoh
and
Moses
tossed
it
into
the
air
and
it
became
festering
boils
breaking
out
on
man
and
beast
11
The
magic-practicing
priests
were
unable
to
stand
before
Moses
because
of
the
boils
for
they
had
developed
on
the
magic-practicing
priests
and
on
all
the
Egyptians
12
But
Jehovah
allowed
Pharaohs
heart
to
become
obstinate
and
he
did
not
listen
to
them
just
as
Jehovah
had
told
Moses
13
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
station
yourself
in
front
of
Pharaoh
and
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
Hebrews
has
said
Send
my
people
away
so
that
they
may
serve
me
14
For
now
I
am
directing
all
my
blows
to
strike
your
heart
your
servants
and
your
people
so
that
you
may
know
that
there
is
no
one
like
me
in
all
the
earth
15
For
by
now
I
could
have
thrust
my
hand
out
to
strike
you
and
your
people
with
a
devastating
plague
and
you
would
have
been
wiped
out
from
the
earth
16
But
for
this
very
reason
I
have
kept
you
in
existence
to
show
you
my
power
and
to
have
my
name
declared
in
all
the
earth
17
Are
you
still
behaving
arrogantly
against
my
people
by
not
sending
them
away
18
Here
I
will
cause
a
very
great
hail
to
rain
down
tomorrow
about
this
time
such
as
has
never
occurred
in
Egypt
from
the
day
it
was
founded
until
now
19
Therefore
send
word
to
bring
all
your
livestock
and
all
that
is
yours
in
the
field
under
shelter
Every
man
and
beast
caught
in
the
field
and
not
brought
into
the
house
will
die
when
the
hail
comes
down
on
them
20
Anyone
among
Pharaohs
servants
who
feared
Jehovahs
word
quickly
brought
his
own
servants
and
his
livestock
into
the
houses
21
but
whoever
did
not
take
Jehovahs
word
to
heart
left
his
servants
and
his
livestock
in
the
field
22
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Stretch
out
your
hand
toward
the
heavens
so
that
hail
may
come
down
on
all
the
land
of
Egypt
on
man
and
beast
and
all
the
vegetation
of
the
field
in
the
land
of
Egypt
23
So
Moses
stretched
out
his
rod
toward
the
heavens
and
Jehovah
sent
thunder
and
hail
and
fire
fell
down
to
the
earth
and
Jehovah
kept
making
it
rain
down
hail
on
the
land
of
Egypt
24
There
was
hail
and
there
was
fire
flashing
in
the
midst
of
the
hail
It
was
very
heavy
there
had
never
been
any
like
it
in
the
land
since
Egypt
had
become
a
nation
25
The
hail
struck
everything
in
the
field
throughout
the
land
of
Egypt
from
man
to
beast
and
it
struck
down
all
the
vegetation
and
shattered
all
the
trees
of
the
field
26
Only
in
the
land
of
Goshen
where
the
Israelites
were
there
was
no
hail
27
So
Pharaoh
sent
for
Moses
and
Aaron
and
said
to
them
I
have
sinned
this
time
Jehovah
is
righteous
and
I
and
my
people
are
in
the
wrong
28
Plead
with
Jehovah
that
there
may
be
an
end
to
Gods
thunder
and
hail
Then
I
will
be
willing
to
send
you
away
and
you
will
not
stay
any
longer
29
So
Moses
said
to
him
As
soon
as
I
go
out
of
the
city
I
will
spread
out
my
hands
before
Jehovah
The
thunder
will
stop
and
the
hail
will
not
continue
any
longer
so
that
you
may
know
that
the
earth
belongs
to
Jehovah
30
But
as
for
you
and
your
servants
I
know
already
that
even
then
you
will
not
fear
Jehovah
God
31
Now
the
flax
and
the
barley
had
been
struck
down
because
the
barley
was
in
the
ear
and
the
flax
had
flower
buds
32
But
the
wheat
and
the
spelt
had
not
been
struck
down
because
they
were
later
crops
33
Moses
now
went
out
of
the
city
from
Pharaoh
and
spread
out
his
hands
before
Jehovah
and
the
thunder
and
the
hail
stopped
and
the
rain
quit
pouring
down
on
the
earth
34
When
Pharaoh
saw
that
the
rain
the
hail
and
the
thunder
had
stopped
he
sinned
again
and
hardened
his
heart
he
as
well
as
his
servants
35
And
Pharaohs
heart
continued
obstinate
and
he
did
not
send
the
Israelites
away
just
as
Jehovah
had
stated
through
Moses
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Go
in
to
Pharaoh
for
I
have
allowed
his
heart
and
the
hearts
of
his
servants
to
become
unresponsive
so
that
I
may
display
these
signs
of
mine
right
before
him
2
and
in
order
that
you
may
declare
to
your
sons
and
your
grandsons
how
severely
I
have
dealt
with
Egypt
and
what
signs
I
have
performed
among
them
and
you
will
certainly
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
3
So
Moses
and
Aaron
went
in
to
Pharaoh
and
said
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
Hebrews
has
said
How
long
will
you
refuse
to
submit
to
me
Send
my
people
away
so
that
they
may
serve
me
4
For
if
you
keep
refusing
to
send
my
people
away
here
I
am
bringing
locusts
within
your
boundaries
tomorrow
5
And
they
will
cover
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
it
will
not
be
possible
to
see
the
ground
They
will
eat
up
what
escaped
the
hail
and
was
left
for
you
and
they
will
eat
all
your
trees
that
are
growing
in
the
field
6
They
will
fill
your
houses
the
houses
of
all
your
servants
and
the
houses
of
all
Egypt
to
an
extent
that
your
fathers
and
your
grandfathers
never
saw
from
the
time
they
have
been
in
this
land
until
today
With
that
he
turned
and
went
out
from
Pharaoh
7
Then
Pharaohs
servants
said
to
him
How
long
will
this
man
continue
to
menace
us
Send
the
men
away
so
that
they
may
serve
Jehovah
their
God
Do
you
not
yet
realize
that
Egypt
has
been
ruined
8
So
Moses
and
Aaron
were
brought
back
to
Pharaoh
and
he
said
to
them
Go
serve
Jehovah
your
God
But
just
who
will
be
going
9
Then
Moses
said
We
will
go
with
our
young
people
our
old
people
our
sons
our
daughters
our
sheep
and
our
cattle
because
we
will
hold
a
festival
to
Jehovah
10
He
said
to
them
If
I
ever
send
you
and
your
children
away
then
Jehovah
is
indeed
with
you
It
is
clear
that
you
intend
to
do
something
evil
11
No
Only
your
men
may
go
and
serve
Jehovah
for
that
is
what
you
requested
With
that
they
were
driven
out
from
before
Pharaoh
12
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Stretch
out
your
hand
over
the
land
of
Egypt
for
the
locusts
so
that
they
may
come
up
over
the
land
of
Egypt
and
eat
up
all
the
vegetation
of
the
land
everything
that
the
hail
has
let
remain
13
At
once
Moses
stretched
out
his
rod
over
the
land
of
Egypt
and
Jehovah
caused
an
east
wind
to
blow
on
the
land
all
that
day
and
all
night
The
morning
came
and
the
east
wind
brought
the
locusts
14
And
the
locusts
came
up
over
all
the
land
of
Egypt
and
settled
down
on
the
whole
territory
of
Egypt
It
was
extremely
severe
never
before
had
there
been
so
many
locusts
nor
would
there
ever
be
so
many
again
15
They
covered
the
surface
of
the
entire
land
and
the
land
grew
dark
with
them
they
devoured
all
the
vegetation
of
the
land
and
all
the
fruit
of
the
trees
that
the
hail
had
left
nothing
green
was
left
on
the
trees
or
on
the
vegetation
of
the
field
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
16
So
Pharaoh
quickly
called
Moses
and
Aaron
and
said
I
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
your
God
and
against
you
17
Now
please
pardon
my
sin
just
this
once
and
plead
with
Jehovah
your
God
that
he
just
remove
this
deadly
plague
from
upon
me
18
So
he
went
out
from
Pharaoh
and
pleaded
with
Jehovah
19
Then
Jehovah
caused
the
wind
to
shift
and
it
became
a
very
stiff
west
wind
and
it
carried
the
locusts
away
and
drove
them
into
the
Red
Sea
Not
a
single
locust
remained
in
all
the
territory
of
Egypt
20
However
Jehovah
allowed
Pharaohs
heart
to
become
obstinate
and
he
did
not
send
the
Israelites
away
21
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
Stretch
out
your
hand
toward
the
heavens
so
that
there
may
be
darkness
over
the
land
of
Egypt
a
darkness
so
thick
that
it
can
be
felt
22
Moses
immediately
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
the
heavens
and
there
was
a
dense
darkness
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
for
three
days
23
They
did
not
see
one
another
and
none
of
them
got
up
from
where
they
were
for
three
days
but
all
the
Israelites
had
light
in
their
dwellings
24
Pharaoh
then
called
Moses
and
said
Go
serve
Jehovah
Only
your
sheep
and
your
cattle
will
remain
behind
Even
your
children
may
go
with
you
25
But
Moses
said
You
yourself
will
also
provide
us
with
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
and
we
will
offer
them
to
Jehovah
our
God
26
Our
livestock
will
also
go
with
us
Not
an
animal
will
be
allowed
to
remain
because
we
will
be
using
some
of
them
to
worship
Jehovah
our
God
and
we
do
not
know
what
we
will
offer
in
worship
to
Jehovah
until
we
arrive
there
27
So
Jehovah
allowed
Pharaohs
heart
to
become
obstinate
and
he
did
not
consent
to
send
them
away
28
Pharaoh
said
to
him
Get
out
of
my
sight
Make
sure
that
you
do
not
try
to
see
my
face
again
for
on
the
day
you
see
my
face
you
will
die
29
To
this
Moses
said
Just
as
you
have
spoken
I
will
not
try
to
see
your
face
again
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
One
more
plague
I
am
going
to
bring
upon
Pharaoh
and
Egypt
After
that
he
will
send
you
away
from
here
When
he
does
send
you
away
he
will
literally
drive
you
out
of
here
2
Now
tell
the
people
that
all
the
men
and
women
should
ask
their
neighbor
for
articles
of
silver
and
of
gold
3
And
Jehovah
gave
the
people
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
Egyptians
Moreover
Moses
himself
had
become
highly
esteemed
in
the
land
of
Egypt
among
Pharaohs
servants
and
among
the
people
4
Moses
then
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
said
About
midnight
I
am
going
out
into
the
midst
of
Egypt
5
and
every
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt
will
die
from
the
firstborn
of
Pharaoh
who
is
sitting
on
his
throne
to
the
firstborn
of
the
slave
girl
who
is
working
at
the
hand
mill
and
every
firstborn
of
the
livestock
6
Throughout
all
the
land
of
Egypt
there
will
be
a
great
outcry
such
as
has
never
occurred
nor
will
ever
occur
again
7
But
not
even
a
dog
will
bark
at
the
Israelites
at
the
men
or
their
livestock
so
that
you
may
know
that
Jehovah
can
make
a
distinction
between
the
Egyptians
and
the
Israelites
8
And
all
your
servants
will
certainly
come
down
to
me
and
prostrate
themselves
to
me
saying
Go
you
and
all
the
people
who
follow
you
And
after
that
I
will
go
out
With
that
he
went
out
from
Pharaoh
in
the
heat
of
anger
9
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
Pharaoh
will
not
listen
to
you
in
order
for
my
miracles
to
be
multiplied
in
the
land
of
Egypt
10
Moses
and
Aaron
performed
all
these
miracles
before
Pharaoh
but
Jehovah
allowed
Pharaohs
heart
to
become
obstinate
so
that
he
did
not
send
the
Israelites
away
from
his
land
1
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
in
the
land
of
Egypt
2
This
month
will
be
the
beginning
of
the
months
for
you
It
will
be
the
first
of
the
months
of
the
year
for
you
3
Speak
to
the
entire
assembly
of
Israel
saying
On
the
tenth
day
of
this
month
they
should
each
take
for
themselves
a
sheep
for
their
fathers
house
a
sheep
to
a
house
4
But
if
the
household
is
too
small
for
the
sheep
they
and
their
nearest
neighbor
should
share
it
between
themselves
in
their
house
according
to
the
number
of
people
When
making
the
calculation
determine
how
much
of
the
sheep
each
one
will
eat
5
Your
sheep
should
be
a
sound
one-year-old
male
You
may
choose
from
the
young
rams
or
from
the
goats
6
You
must
care
for
it
until
the
14th
day
of
this
month
and
the
whole
congregation
of
the
assembly
of
Israel
must
slaughter
it
at
twilight
7
They
must
take
some
of
the
blood
and
splash
it
on
the
two
doorposts
and
the
upper
part
of
the
doorway
of
the
houses
in
which
they
eat
it
8
They
must
eat
the
meat
on
this
night
They
should
roast
it
over
the
fire
and
eat
it
along
with
unleavened
bread
and
bitter
greens
9
Do
not
eat
any
of
it
raw
or
boiled
cooked
in
water
but
roast
it
over
the
fire
its
head
together
with
its
shanks
and
its
inner
parts
10
You
must
not
save
any
of
it
until
morning
but
any
of
it
left
over
until
morning
you
should
burn
with
fire
11
And
this
is
how
you
should
eat
it
with
your
belt
fastened
sandals
on
your
feet
and
your
staff
in
your
hand
and
you
should
eat
it
in
a
hurry
It
is
Jehovahs
Passover
12
For
I
will
pass
through
the
land
of
Egypt
on
this
night
and
strike
every
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt
from
man
to
beast
and
I
will
execute
judgment
on
all
the
gods
of
Egypt
I
am
Jehovah
13
The
blood
will
serve
as
your
sign
on
the
houses
where
you
are
and
I
will
see
the
blood
and
pass
over
you
and
the
plague
will
not
come
on
you
to
destroy
you
when
I
strike
the
land
of
Egypt
14
This
day
will
serve
as
a
memorial
for
you
and
you
must
celebrate
it
as
a
festival
to
Jehovah
throughout
your
generations
As
a
lasting
statute
you
should
celebrate
it
15
Seven
days
you
are
to
eat
unleavened
bread
Yes
on
the
first
day
you
are
to
remove
the
sourdough
from
your
houses
because
anyone
eating
what
is
leavened
from
the
first
day
down
to
the
seventh
that
person
must
be
cut
off
from
Israel
16
On
the
first
day
you
will
hold
a
holy
convention
and
on
the
seventh
day
another
holy
convention
No
work
is
to
be
done
on
these
days
Only
what
every
person
needs
to
eat
that
alone
may
be
prepared
for
you
17
You
must
keep
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
for
on
this
very
day
I
will
bring
your
multitudes
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
And
you
must
keep
this
day
throughout
your
generations
as
a
lasting
statute
18
In
the
first
month
on
the
14th
day
of
the
month
in
the
evening
you
are
to
eat
unleavened
bread
until
the
21st
day
of
the
month
in
the
evening
19
No
sourdough
is
to
be
found
in
your
houses
for
seven
days
because
if
anyone
eats
what
is
leavened
whether
he
is
a
foreigner
or
a
native
of
the
land
that
person
must
be
cut
off
from
the
assembly
of
Israel
20
You
should
not
eat
anything
leavened
In
all
your
homes
you
are
to
eat
unleavened
bread
21
Moses
promptly
called
all
the
elders
of
Israel
and
said
to
them
Go
and
select
young
animals
for
each
of
your
families
and
slaughter
the
Passover
sacrifice
22
Then
you
must
dip
a
bunch
of
hyssop
into
the
blood
that
is
in
a
basin
and
strike
the
upper
part
of
the
doorway
and
the
two
doorposts
with
the
blood
and
none
of
you
should
go
out
of
the
entrance
of
his
house
until
morning
23
Then
when
Jehovah
passes
through
to
plague
the
Egyptians
and
sees
the
blood
on
the
upper
part
of
the
doorway
and
on
the
two
doorposts
Jehovah
will
certainly
pass
over
the
entrance
and
he
will
not
allow
the
plague
of
death
to
enter
into
your
houses
24
You
must
observe
this
event
as
a
lasting
regulation
for
you
and
your
sons
25
And
when
you
come
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
will
give
you
just
as
he
has
stated
you
must
keep
this
observance
26
And
when
your
sons
ask
you
What
does
this
observance
mean
to
you
27
you
must
say
It
is
the
sacrifice
of
the
Passover
to
Jehovah
who
passed
over
the
houses
of
the
Israelites
in
Egypt
when
he
plagued
the
Egyptians
but
he
spared
our
houses
Then
the
people
bowed
low
and
prostrated
themselves
28
So
the
Israelites
went
and
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
and
Aaron
They
did
just
so
29
Then
at
midnight
Jehovah
struck
down
every
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt
from
the
firstborn
of
Pharaoh
who
was
sitting
on
his
throne
to
the
firstborn
of
the
captive
who
was
in
the
prison
and
every
firstborn
of
the
animals
30
Pharaoh
got
up
that
night
along
with
all
his
servants
and
all
the
other
Egyptians
and
there
was
a
great
outcry
among
the
Egyptians
because
there
was
not
a
house
where
someone
was
not
dead
31
At
once
he
called
Moses
and
Aaron
by
night
and
said
Get
up
get
out
from
among
my
people
both
you
and
the
other
Israelites
Go
and
serve
Jehovah
just
as
you
have
said
32
Take
also
your
flocks
and
your
herds
and
go
just
as
you
have
said
But
you
must
also
bless
me
33
And
the
Egyptians
began
to
urge
the
people
to
depart
quickly
out
of
the
land
because

as
they
said
we
are
all
as
good
as
dead
34
So
the
people
carried
their
flour
dough
before
it
was
leavened
with
their
kneading
troughs
wrapped
up
in
their
clothing
on
their
shoulder
35
The
Israelites
did
what
Moses
had
told
them
and
asked
the
Egyptians
for
articles
of
silver
and
of
gold
as
well
as
clothing
36
Jehovah
gave
the
people
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
Egyptians
so
that
they
gave
them
what
they
asked
for
and
they
plundered
the
Egyptians
37
Then
the
Israelites
departed
from
Rameses
for
Succoth
about
600000
men
on
foot
besides
children
38
And
a
vast
mixed
company
also
went
with
them
as
well
as
flocks
and
herds
a
great
number
of
livestock
39
They
began
to
bake
the
dough
that
they
brought
from
Egypt
into
round
loaves
of
unleavened
bread
It
was
not
leavened
because
they
had
been
driven
out
of
Egypt
so
suddenly
that
they
had
not
prepared
any
provisions
for
themselves
40
The
dwelling
of
the
Israelites
who
had
dwelled
in
Egypt
was
430
years
41
At
the
end
of
the
430
years
on
this
very
day
all
the
multitudes
of
Jehovah
went
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
42
It
is
a
night
on
which
they
will
celebrate
Jehovahs
bringing
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
This
night
is
to
be
observed
to
Jehovah
by
all
the
people
of
Israel
throughout
their
generations
43
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
This
is
the
statute
of
the
Passover
No
foreigner
may
eat
of
it
44
But
if
someone
has
a
slave
man
who
was
purchased
with
money
you
should
circumcise
him
Only
then
may
he
share
in
eating
it
45
A
settler
and
a
hired
worker
may
not
eat
of
it
46
In
one
house
it
is
to
be
eaten
You
must
not
take
any
of
the
meat
outside
of
the
house
and
you
must
not
break
any
of
its
bones
47
All
the
assembly
of
Israel
are
to
celebrate
it
48
If
a
foreigner
resides
with
you
and
he
wants
to
celebrate
the
Passover
to
Jehovah
every
male
of
his
must
be
circumcised
Then
he
may
come
near
to
celebrate
it
and
he
will
become
like
a
native
of
the
land
But
no
uncircumcised
man
may
eat
of
it
49
One
law
will
apply
for
the
native
and
for
the
foreigner
who
is
residing
among
you
50
So
all
the
Israelites
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
and
Aaron
They
did
just
so
51
On
this
very
day
Jehovah
brought
the
Israelites
along
with
their
multitudes
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
1
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
2
Sanctify
to
me
every
firstborn
male
among
the
Israelites
The
first
male
to
be
born
of
both
human
and
animal
belongs
to
me
3
Then
Moses
said
to
the
people
Remember
this
day
on
which
you
went
out
of
Egypt
from
the
house
of
slavery
because
with
a
mighty
hand
Jehovah
brought
you
out
of
here
So
nothing
leavened
may
be
eaten
4
You
are
going
out
on
this
day
in
the
month
of
Abib
5
When
Jehovah
has
brought
you
into
the
land
of
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Amorites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
which
he
swore
to
your
forefathers
to
give
you
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
then
you
must
keep
this
observance
in
this
month
6
Seven
days
you
are
to
eat
unleavened
bread
and
on
the
seventh
day
there
will
be
a
festival
to
Jehovah
7
Unleavened
bread
is
to
be
eaten
for
the
seven
days
and
nothing
leavened
is
to
be
found
with
you
and
no
sourdough
is
to
be
found
with
you
within
all
your
territory
8
And
you
must
tell
your
son
on
that
day
It
is
because
of
what
Jehovah
did
for
me
when
I
came
out
of
Egypt
9
And
this
will
serve
for
you
as
a
sign
on
your
hand
and
as
a
memorial
on
your
forehead
so
that
Jehovahs
law
may
be
in
your
mouth
for
with
a
mighty
hand
Jehovah
brought
you
out
of
Egypt
10
You
must
keep
this
statute
at
its
appointed
time
from
year
to
year
11
When
Jehovah
brings
you
into
the
land
of
the
Canaanites
which
he
has
sworn
to
you
and
to
your
forefathers
to
give
to
you
12
you
must
devote
to
Jehovah
every
firstborn
male
as
well
as
every
male
firstling
of
the
livestock
that
you
acquire
The
males
belong
to
Jehovah
13
Every
firstling
donkey
you
are
to
redeem
with
a
sheep
and
if
you
do
not
redeem
it
then
you
must
break
its
neck
And
every
firstborn
male
of
your
sons
you
are
to
redeem
14
In
case
your
son
should
ask
you
later
on
What
does
this
mean
then
you
should
say
to
him
With
a
mighty
hand
Jehovah
brought
us
out
of
Egypt
from
the
house
of
slavery
15
When
Pharaoh
stubbornly
refused
to
send
us
away
Jehovah
killed
every
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt
from
the
firstborn
of
man
to
the
firstborn
of
beast
That
is
why
I
am
sacrificing
to
Jehovah
all
the
firstborn
males
and
I
redeem
every
firstborn
of
my
sons
16
This
must
serve
as
a
sign
on
your
hand
and
as
a
headband
on
your
forehead
for
with
a
mighty
hand
Jehovah
brought
us
out
of
Egypt
17
Now
when
Pharaoh
sent
the
people
away
God
did
not
lead
them
by
the
way
of
the
land
of
the
Philistines
although
it
was
near
For
God
said
The
people
may
change
their
minds
when
they
are
confronted
by
war
and
will
return
to
Egypt
18
So
God
made
the
people
go
around
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
the
Red
Sea
But
it
was
in
battle
formation
that
the
Israelites
went
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
19
Moses
also
took
Josephs
bones
with
him
because
Joseph
had
made
the
sons
of
Israel
solemnly
swear
God
will
not
fail
to
turn
his
attention
to
you
and
you
must
take
my
bones
up
out
of
here
with
you
20
They
departed
from
Succoth
and
encamped
at
Etham
at
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
21
Now
Jehovah
was
going
ahead
of
them
by
day
in
a
pillar
of
cloud
to
lead
them
along
the
way
and
by
night
in
a
pillar
of
fire
to
give
them
light
so
that
they
could
travel
by
day
and
by
night
22
The
pillar
of
cloud
would
not
move
away
from
before
the
people
during
the
day
nor
the
pillar
of
fire
at
night
1
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
2
Tell
the
Israelites
that
they
should
turn
back
and
encamp
before
Pihahiroth
between
Migdol
and
the
sea
within
view
of
Baal-zephon
You
are
to
encamp
facing
it
by
the
sea
3
Then
Pharaoh
will
say
about
the
Israelites
They
are
wandering
in
confusion
in
the
land
The
wilderness
has
closed
in
on
them
4
I
will
allow
Pharaohs
heart
to
become
obstinate
and
he
will
chase
after
them
and
I
will
glorify
myself
by
means
of
Pharaoh
and
all
his
army
and
the
Egyptians
will
certainly
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
So
that
is
what
they
did
5
Later
it
was
reported
to
the
king
of
Egypt
that
the
people
had
run
away
Immediately
Pharaoh
and
his
servants
had
a
change
of
heart
regarding
the
people
and
they
said
Why
did
we
do
this
and
release
Israel
from
serving
as
slaves
for
us
6
So
he
made
his
war
chariots
ready
and
he
took
his
people
with
him
7
He
took
600
chosen
chariots
and
all
the
other
chariots
of
Egypt
with
warriors
on
every
one
of
them
8
Thus
Jehovah
allowed
the
heart
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
to
become
obstinate
and
he
chased
after
the
Israelites
while
the
Israelites
were
going
out
with
confidence
9
The
Egyptians
chased
after
them
and
all
the
chariot
horses
of
Pharaoh
and
his
cavalrymen
and
his
army
were
catching
up
with
them
while
they
were
camping
by
the
sea
by
Pihahiroth
facing
Baal-zephon
10
When
Pharaoh
got
closer
the
Israelites
raised
their
eyes
and
saw
the
Egyptians
pursuing
them
The
Israelites
became
terrified
and
began
to
cry
out
to
Jehovah
11
They
said
to
Moses
Is
it
because
there
are
no
burial
places
in
Egypt
that
you
have
brought
us
here
to
die
in
the
wilderness
What
have
you
done
to
us
by
leading
us
out
of
Egypt
12
Is
this
not
the
very
thing
we
told
you
in
Egypt
when
we
said
Let
us
alone
so
that
we
may
serve
the
Egyptians
For
it
is
better
for
us
to
serve
the
Egyptians
than
to
die
in
the
wilderness
13
Then
Moses
said
to
the
people
Do
not
be
afraid
Stand
firm
and
see
the
salvation
of
Jehovah
that
he
will
perform
for
you
today
For
the
Egyptians
whom
you
see
today
you
will
never
ever
see
again
14
Jehovah
himself
will
fight
for
you
and
you
will
keep
silent
15
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Why
do
you
keep
crying
out
to
me
Tell
the
Israelites
that
they
should
break
camp
16
As
for
you
lift
up
your
rod
and
stretch
out
your
hand
over
the
sea
and
divide
it
so
that
the
Israelites
may
go
through
the
midst
of
the
sea
on
dry
ground
17
As
for
me
I
am
allowing
the
hearts
of
the
Egyptians
to
become
obstinate
so
that
they
will
go
in
after
them
thus
I
will
glorify
myself
by
means
of
Pharaoh
and
all
his
army
his
war
chariots
and
his
cavalrymen
18
And
the
Egyptians
will
certainly
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
glorify
myself
by
means
of
Pharaoh
his
war
chariots
and
his
cavalrymen
19
Then
the
angel
of
the
true
God
who
was
going
ahead
of
the
camp
of
Israel
departed
and
went
to
their
rear
and
the
pillar
of
cloud
that
was
in
front
of
them
moved
to
the
rear
and
stood
behind
them
20
So
it
came
between
the
camp
of
the
Egyptians
and
the
camp
of
Israel
On
the
one
side
it
was
a
dark
cloud
On
the
other
side
it
was
lighting
up
the
night
So
the
one
camp
did
not
come
near
the
other
camp
all
night
long
21
Moses
now
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
sea
and
Jehovah
drove
the
sea
back
with
a
strong
east
wind
all
night
long
turning
the
sea
basin
into
dry
ground
and
the
waters
divided
22
So
the
Israelites
went
through
the
midst
of
the
sea
on
dry
ground
while
the
waters
formed
a
wall
on
their
right
hand
and
on
their
left
23
The
Egyptians
pursued
them
and
all
Pharaohs
horses
his
war
chariots
and
his
cavalrymen
began
going
after
them
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
24
During
the
morning
watch
Jehovah
looked
at
the
camp
of
the
Egyptians
from
within
the
pillar
of
fire
and
cloud
and
he
threw
the
camp
of
the
Egyptians
into
confusion
25
He
kept
taking
wheels
off
their
chariots
so
that
they
were
driving
them
with
difficulty
and
the
Egyptians
were
saying
Let
us
flee
from
any
contact
with
Israel
because
Jehovah
is
fighting
for
them
against
the
Egyptians
26
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Stretch
out
your
hand
over
the
sea
so
that
the
waters
may
come
back
over
the
Egyptians
their
war
chariots
and
their
cavalrymen
27
Moses
at
once
stretched
out
his
hand
over
the
sea
and
as
morning
approached
the
sea
returned
to
its
normal
condition
As
the
Egyptians
fled
from
it
Jehovah
shook
the
Egyptians
off
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
28
The
returning
waters
covered
the
war
chariots
and
the
cavalrymen
and
all
of
Pharaohs
army
who
had
gone
into
the
sea
after
them
Not
so
much
as
one
among
them
was
allowed
to
survive
29
But
the
Israelites
walked
on
dry
ground
in
the
midst
of
the
seabed
and
the
waters
formed
a
wall
on
their
right
hand
and
on
their
left
30
Thus
Jehovah
saved
Israel
on
that
day
from
the
hand
of
the
Egyptians
and
Israel
saw
the
Egyptians
dead
on
the
seashore
31
Israel
also
saw
the
great
power
that
Jehovah
wielded
against
the
Egyptians
and
the
people
began
to
fear
Jehovah
and
to
put
faith
in
Jehovah
and
in
his
servant
Moses
1
At
that
time
Moses
and
the
Israelites
sang
this
song
to
Jehovah
Let
me
sing
to
Jehovah
for
he
has
become
highly
exalted
The
horse
and
its
rider
he
has
hurled
into
the
sea

2
My
strength
and
my
might
is
Jah
since
he
has
become
my
salvation
This
is
my
God
and
I
will
praise
him
my
fathers
God
and
I
will
exalt
him

3
Jehovah
is
a
powerful
warrior
Jehovah
is
his
name

4
Pharaohs
chariots
and
his
army
He
has
cast
into
the
sea
And
his
finest
warriors
have
sunk
into
the
Red
Sea

5
The
surging
waters
covered
them
down
into
the
depths
they
sank
like
a
stone

6
Your
right
hand
O
Jehovah
is
great
in
power
Your
right
hand
O
Jehovah
can
shatter
an
enemy

7
In
your
great
majesty
you
can
throw
down
those
who
rise
up
against
you
You
send
out
your
burning
anger
it
eats
them
up
like
stubble

8
By
a
breath
from
your
nostrils
waters
massed
together
They
stood
still
holding
back
the
floods
The
surging
waters
congealed
in
the
heart
of
the
sea

9
The
enemy
said
I
will
pursue
I
will
overtake
I
will
divide
spoil
until
I
am
satisfied
I
will
draw
my
sword
My
hand
will
subdue
them
10
You
blew
with
your
breath
the
sea
covered
them
They
sank
like
lead
in
majestic
waters
11
Who
among
the
gods
is
like
you
O
Jehovah
Who
is
like
you
showing
yourself
mighty
in
holiness
The
One
to
be
feared
with
songs
of
praise
the
One
doing
wonders
12
You
stretched
out
your
right
hand
and
the
earth
swallowed
them
up
13
In
your
loyal
love
you
have
led
the
people
whom
you
have
redeemed
In
your
strength
you
will
guide
them
to
your
holy
place
of
dwelling
14
Peoples
must
hear
they
will
shudder
Anguish
will
seize
the
inhabitants
of
Philistia
15
At
that
time
the
sheikhs
of
Edom
will
be
terrified
And
trembling
will
take
hold
of
the
mighty
rulers
of
Moab
All
the
inhabitants
of
Canaan
will
be
disheartened
16
Fear
and
dread
will
fall
upon
them
Because
of
the
greatness
of
your
arm
they
will
be
as
motionless
as
a
stoneUntil
your
people
pass
by
O
Jehovah
Until
the
people
whom
you
produced
pass
by
17
You
will
bring
them
and
plant
them
in
the
mountain
of
your
inheritance
The
established
place
that
you
have
prepared
for
yourself
to
inhabit
O
Jehovah
A
sanctuary
O
Jehovah
that
your
hands
have
established
18
Jehovah
will
rule
as
king
forever
and
ever
19
When
Pharaohs
horses
with
his
war
chariots
and
his
cavalrymen
went
into
the
sea
Then
Jehovah
brought
back
the
waters
of
the
sea
upon
them
But
the
people
of
Israel
walked
on
dry
ground
through
the
midst
of
the
sea
20
Then
Miriam
the
prophetess
Aarons
sister
took
a
tambourine
in
her
hand
and
all
the
women
followed
her
with
tambourines
and
with
dances
21
Miriam
sang
in
response
to
the
men
Sing
to
Jehovah
for
he
has
become
highly
exalted
The
horse
and
its
rider
he
has
hurled
into
the
sea
22
Moses
later
led
Israel
away
from
the
Red
Sea
and
they
went
out
to
the
wilderness
of
Shur
and
marched
on
for
three
days
in
the
wilderness
but
they
did
not
find
water
23
They
came
to
Marah
but
they
were
not
able
to
drink
the
water
from
Marah
because
it
was
bitter
That
is
why
he
named
it
Marah
24
So
the
people
began
to
murmur
against
Moses
saying
What
are
we
to
drink
25
He
cried
out
to
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
directed
him
to
a
tree
When
he
threw
it
into
the
water
the
water
became
sweet
There
He
established
for
them
a
regulation
and
a
case
for
judgment
and
there
He
put
them
to
the
test
26
He
said
If
you
will
strictly
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
will
do
what
is
right
in
his
eyes
and
will
pay
attention
to
his
commandments
and
keep
all
his
regulations
I
will
not
bring
upon
you
any
of
the
diseases
that
I
brought
upon
the
Egyptians
for
I
Jehovah
am
healing
you
27
After
that
they
came
to
Elim
where
there
were
12
springs
of
water
and
70
palm
trees
So
they
camped
there
by
the
water
1
After
they
departed
from
Elim
the
entire
assembly
of
the
Israelites
eventually
came
to
the
wilderness
of
Sin
which
is
between
Elim
and
Sinai
on
the
15th
day
of
the
second
month
after
their
departure
from
the
land
of
Egypt
2
Then
the
entire
assembly
of
the
Israelites
began
to
murmur
against
Moses
and
Aaron
in
the
wilderness
3
The
Israelites
kept
saying
to
them
If
only
we
had
died
by
Jehovahs
hand
in
the
land
of
Egypt
while
we
were
sitting
by
the
pots
of
meat
while
we
were
eating
bread
to
satisfaction
Now
you
have
brought
us
out
into
this
wilderness
to
put
this
whole
congregation
to
death
by
famine
4
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Here
I
am
raining
down
bread
for
you
from
the
heavens
and
each
of
the
people
should
go
out
to
gather
his
amount
day
by
day
so
that
I
may
put
them
to
the
test
to
see
whether
they
will
walk
in
my
law
or
not
5
But
on
the
sixth
day
when
they
prepare
what
they
have
gathered
it
is
to
be
double
the
amount
that
they
pick
up
on
each
of
the
other
days
6
So
Moses
and
Aaron
said
to
all
the
Israelites
In
the
evening
you
will
certainly
know
that
it
is
Jehovah
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
7
In
the
morning
you
will
see
Jehovahs
glory
for
he
has
heard
your
murmurings
against
Jehovah
Who
are
we
that
you
should
murmur
against
us
8
Moses
continued
When
Jehovah
gives
you
meat
to
eat
in
the
evening
and
in
the
morning
bread
to
satisfaction
you
will
see
that
Jehovah
has
heard
your
murmurings
that
you
are
murmuring
against
him
But
who
are
we
Your
murmurings
are
not
against
us
but
against
Jehovah
9
Then
Moses
said
to
Aaron
Tell
the
entire
assembly
of
the
Israelites
Come
near
before
Jehovah
for
he
has
heard
your
murmurings
10
As
soon
as
Aaron
had
spoken
to
the
entire
assembly
of
the
Israelites
they
turned
and
faced
toward
the
wilderness
and
look
Jehovahs
glory
appeared
in
the
cloud
11
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
12
I
have
heard
the
murmurings
of
the
Israelites
Tell
them
At
twilight
you
will
eat
meat
and
in
the
morning
you
will
be
satisfied
with
bread
and
you
will
certainly
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
13
So
that
evening
quail
came
and
covered
the
camp
and
in
the
morning
a
layer
of
dew
was
all
around
the
camp
14
When
the
layer
of
dew
evaporated
there
was
a
fine
flaky
substance
on
the
surface
of
the
wilderness
as
fine
as
frost
on
the
ground
15
When
the
Israelites
saw
it
they
began
to
say
to
one
another
What
is
it
for
they
did
not
know
what
it
was
Moses
said
to
them
It
is
the
bread
that
Jehovah
has
given
you
for
food
16
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
commanded
Each
one
should
gather
it
according
to
how
much
he
can
eat
You
are
to
take
an
omer
measure
for
each
individual
according
to
the
number
of
the
people
that
each
of
you
has
in
his
tent
17
The
Israelites
began
to
do
so
they
gathered
it
some
gathering
much
and
some
gathering
little
18
When
they
would
measure
it
by
the
omer
the
one
who
had
gathered
much
had
no
surplus
and
the
one
who
had
gathered
little
had
no
shortage
They
each
gathered
it
according
to
what
they
could
eat
19
Then
Moses
said
to
them
Nobody
should
leave
any
of
it
until
the
morning
20
But
they
did
not
listen
to
Moses
When
some
men
left
some
of
it
until
the
morning
it
bred
worms
and
stank
and
Moses
became
indignant
at
them
21
They
would
pick
it
up
morning
by
morning
each
one
according
to
what
he
could
eat
When
the
sun
got
hot
it
melted
22
On
the
sixth
day
they
picked
up
twice
as
much
bread
two
omer
measures
for
each
person
So
all
the
chieftains
of
the
assembly
came
and
reported
it
to
Moses
23
At
that
he
said
to
them
It
is
what
Jehovah
has
said
Tomorrow
there
will
be
a
complete
rest
a
holy
sabbath
to
Jehovah
Bake
what
you
need
to
bake
and
boil
what
you
need
to
boil
then
save
whatever
is
left
over
and
keep
it
until
the
morning
24
So
they
saved
it
until
the
morning
just
as
Moses
had
commanded
and
it
did
not
stink
nor
were
there
maggots
in
it
25
Then
Moses
said
Eat
it
today
because
today
is
a
sabbath
to
Jehovah
Today
you
will
not
find
it
on
the
ground
26
You
will
pick
it
up
for
six
days
but
on
the
seventh
day
the
Sabbath
there
will
be
none
27
However
some
of
the
people
did
go
out
to
pick
it
up
on
the
seventh
day
but
they
found
nothing
28
So
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
How
long
will
you
refuse
to
keep
my
commandments
and
my
laws
29
Take
notice
of
the
fact
that
Jehovah
has
given
you
the
Sabbath
That
is
why
he
is
giving
you
the
bread
for
two
days
on
the
sixth
day
Everyone
must
stay
where
he
is
nobody
is
to
leave
his
locality
on
the
seventh
day
30
So
the
people
observed
the
Sabbath
on
the
seventh
day
31
The
house
of
Israel
named
the
bread
manna
It
was
white
like
coriander
seed
and
its
taste
was
like
that
of
flat
cakes
with
honey
32
Then
Moses
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
commanded
Fill
an
omer
measure
of
it
as
something
to
be
kept
throughout
your
generations
so
that
they
may
see
the
bread
that
I
gave
you
to
eat
in
the
wilderness
when
I
was
bringing
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
33
So
Moses
said
to
Aaron
Take
a
jar
and
put
in
it
an
omer
measure
of
manna
and
deposit
it
before
Jehovah
as
something
to
be
kept
throughout
your
generations
34
Just
as
Jehovah
commanded
Moses
Aaron
placed
it
before
the
Testimony
so
that
it
might
be
preserved
35
The
Israelites
ate
the
manna
for
40
years
until
they
came
to
a
land
that
was
inhabited
They
ate
the
manna
until
they
came
to
the
frontier
of
the
land
of
Canaan
36
Now
an
omer
is
a
tenth
of
an
ephah
measure
1
The
entire
assembly
of
the
Israelites
departed
from
the
wilderness
of
Sin
by
stages
according
to
the
order
of
Jehovah
and
they
camped
at
Rephidim
But
there
was
no
water
for
the
people
to
drink
2
So
the
people
began
quarreling
with
Moses
and
saying
Give
us
water
to
drink
But
Moses
said
to
them
Why
are
you
quarreling
with
me
Why
do
you
keep
putting
Jehovah
to
the
test
3
But
the
people
were
very
thirsty
for
water
there
and
they
kept
murmuring
against
Moses
and
saying
Why
have
you
brought
us
up
out
of
Egypt
to
kill
us
and
our
sons
and
our
livestock
with
thirst
4
Finally
Moses
cried
out
to
Jehovah
What
should
I
do
with
this
people
A
little
longer
and
they
will
stone
me
5
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Go
ahead
of
the
people
and
take
with
you
some
of
the
elders
of
Israel
and
your
rod
with
which
you
struck
the
Nile
River
Take
it
in
your
hand
and
walk
on
6
Look
I
will
be
standing
before
you
there
on
the
rock
in
Horeb
You
must
strike
the
rock
and
water
will
come
out
of
it
and
the
people
will
drink
it
Moses
did
so
before
the
eyes
of
the
elders
of
Israel
7
So
he
named
the
place
Massah
and
Meribah
because
of
the
quarreling
of
the
Israelites
and
because
they
put
Jehovah
to
the
test
by
saying
Is
Jehovah
in
our
midst
or
not
8
Then
the
Amalekites
came
and
fought
against
Israel
in
Rephidim
9
At
this
Moses
said
to
Joshua
Choose
men
for
us
and
go
out
to
fight
against
the
Amalekites
Tomorrow
I
will
stand
on
top
of
the
hill
with
the
rod
of
the
true
God
in
my
hand
10
Then
Joshua
did
just
as
Moses
told
him
and
he
fought
against
the
Amalekites
And
Moses
Aaron
and
Hur
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
11
As
long
as
Moses
kept
his
hands
lifted
up
the
Israelites
prevailed
but
as
soon
as
he
would
let
down
his
hands
the
Amalekites
prevailed
12
When
the
hands
of
Moses
were
heavy
they
took
a
stone
and
put
it
under
him
and
he
sat
on
it
Then
Aaron
and
Hur
one
on
each
side
supported
his
hands
so
that
his
hands
remained
steady
until
the
sun
set
13
Thus
Joshua
defeated
Amalek
and
his
people
with
the
sword
14
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Write
this
as
a
memorial
in
the
book
and
repeat
it
to
Joshua
I
will
completely
wipe
out
the
memory
of
Amalek
from
under
the
heavens
15
Then
Moses
built
an
altar
and
named
it
Jehovah-nissi
16
saying
Because
his
hand
is
against
the
throne
of
Jah
Jehovah
will
have
war
with
Amalek
from
generation
to
generation
1
Now
Jethro
the
priest
of
Midian
Moses
father-in-law
heard
about
all
that
God
had
done
for
Moses
and
for
his
people
Israel
how
Jehovah
had
brought
Israel
out
of
Egypt
2
Jethro
Moses
father-in-law
had
taken
in
Zipporah
Moses
wife
when
she
was
sent
back
to
him
3
along
with
her
two
sons
One
son
was
named
Gershom
because
Moses
said
I
have
become
a
foreign
resident
in
a
foreign
land

4
and
the
other
was
named
Eliezer
because
he
said
The
God
of
my
father
is
my
helper
who
rescued
me
from
Pharaohs
sword
5
So
Jethro
Moses
father-in-law
along
with
Moses
sons
and
his
wife
came
to
Moses
into
the
wilderness
where
he
was
camping
at
the
mountain
of
the
true
God
6
Then
he
sent
word
to
Moses
I
your
father-in-law
Jethro
am
coming
to
you
with
your
wife
and
her
two
sons
7
At
once
Moses
went
out
to
meet
his
father-in-law
and
he
bowed
down
and
kissed
him
Each
of
them
asked
about
the
others
welfare
and
then
they
went
into
the
tent
8
Moses
related
to
his
father-in-law
all
that
Jehovah
had
done
to
Pharaoh
and
Egypt
in
behalf
of
Israel
all
the
hardships
that
had
befallen
them
along
the
way
and
how
Jehovah
had
delivered
them
9
Jethro
rejoiced
over
all
the
good
that
Jehovah
had
done
for
Israel
by
rescuing
them
from
Egypt
10
Then
Jethro
said
Praised
be
Jehovah
who
rescued
you
from
Egypt
and
from
Pharaoh
and
who
rescued
the
people
from
under
Egypts
control
11
Now
I
know
that
Jehovah
is
greater
than
all
the
other
gods
because
of
what
he
did
to
those
who
acted
arrogantly
against
his
people
12
Then
Jethro
Moses
father-in-law
brought
a
burnt
offering
and
sacrifices
for
God
and
Aaron
and
all
the
elders
of
Israel
came
to
eat
a
meal
with
Moses
father-in-law
before
the
true
God
13
On
the
next
day
Moses
sat
down
as
usual
to
serve
as
judge
for
the
people
and
the
people
kept
standing
before
Moses
from
morning
until
evening
14
When
Moses
father-in-law
saw
all
that
he
was
doing
for
the
people
he
said
What
is
this
that
you
are
doing
for
the
people
Why
do
you
sit
here
alone
with
all
the
people
standing
before
you
from
morning
until
evening
15
Moses
said
to
his
father-in-law
Because
the
people
keep
coming
to
me
to
inquire
of
God
16
When
a
case
arises
it
comes
to
me
and
I
must
judge
between
one
person
and
the
other
and
I
make
known
the
decisions
of
the
true
God
and
his
laws
17
Moses
father-in-law
said
to
him
What
you
are
doing
is
not
good
18
You
will
surely
wear
out
both
you
and
this
people
who
are
with
you
because
this
is
too
big
a
load
for
you
and
you
cannot
carry
it
by
yourself
19
Now
listen
to
me
I
will
give
you
advice
and
God
will
be
with
you
You
serve
as
representative
for
the
people
before
the
true
God
and
you
must
bring
the
cases
to
the
true
God
20
You
should
warn
them
about
what
the
regulations
and
the
laws
are
and
make
known
to
them
the
way
in
which
they
should
walk
and
the
work
that
they
should
do
21
But
you
should
select
from
the
people
capable
men
fearing
God
trustworthy
men
hating
dishonest
profit
and
appoint
these
over
them
as
chiefs
over
thousands
chiefs
over
hundreds
chiefs
over
fifties
and
chiefs
over
tens
22
They
should
judge
the
people
when
cases
arise
and
they
will
bring
every
difficult
case
to
you
but
every
minor
case
they
will
decide
Make
it
easier
for
yourself
by
letting
them
share
the
load
along
with
you
23
If
you
do
this
and
God
so
commands
you
you
will
be
able
to
stand
the
strain
and
everyone
will
go
home
satisfied
24
Moses
immediately
listened
to
his
father-in-law
and
did
all
that
he
had
said
25
Moses
chose
capable
men
out
of
all
Israel
and
appointed
them
heads
over
the
people
as
chiefs
of
thousands
chiefs
of
hundreds
chiefs
of
fifties
and
chiefs
of
tens
26
So
they
judged
the
people
when
cases
arose
A
difficult
case
they
would
bring
to
Moses
but
every
minor
case
they
would
judge
27
After
that
Moses
saw
his
father-in-law
off
and
he
went
his
way
to
his
land
1
In
the
third
month
after
the
Israelites
went
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
on
the
same
day
they
came
to
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
2
They
pulled
away
from
Rephidim
and
came
to
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
and
camped
in
the
wilderness
Israel
camped
there
in
front
of
the
mountain
3
Then
Moses
went
up
to
the
true
God
and
Jehovah
called
to
him
from
the
mountain
saying
This
is
what
you
are
to
say
to
the
house
of
Jacob
and
to
tell
the
Israelites
4
You
have
seen
for
yourselves
what
I
did
to
the
Egyptians
in
order
to
carry
you
on
wings
of
eagles
and
bring
you
to
myself
5
Now
if
you
will
strictly
obey
my
voice
and
keep
my
covenant
you
will
certainly
become
my
special
property
out
of
all
peoples
for
the
whole
earth
belongs
to
me
6
You
will
become
to
me
a
kingdom
of
priests
and
a
holy
nation
These
are
the
words
that
you
are
to
say
to
the
Israelites
7
So
Moses
went
and
summoned
the
elders
of
the
people
and
declared
to
them
all
these
words
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
8
After
that
all
the
people
answered
unanimously
All
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
we
are
willing
to
do
Moses
immediately
took
the
peoples
response
to
Jehovah
9
And
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Look
I
am
coming
to
you
in
a
dark
cloud
so
that
the
people
may
hear
when
I
speak
with
you
and
so
that
they
may
always
put
faith
in
you
as
well
Then
Moses
reported
the
words
of
the
people
to
Jehovah
10
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Go
to
the
people
and
sanctify
them
today
and
tomorrow
and
they
must
wash
their
clothing
11
And
they
must
be
ready
for
the
third
day
because
on
the
third
day
Jehovah
will
come
down
upon
Mount
Sinai
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
people
12
You
must
set
boundaries
for
the
people
all
around
it
and
tell
them
Beware
of
going
up
to
the
mountain
or
touching
its
border
Anybody
touching
the
mountain
will
surely
be
put
to
death
13
No
hand
is
to
touch
him
but
he
will
either
be
stoned
or
be
shot
through
Whether
beast
or
man
he
will
not
live
But
at
the
sound
of
the
rams
horn
they
may
come
up
to
the
mountain
14
Then
Moses
went
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
people
and
he
began
to
sanctify
the
people
and
they
washed
their
clothing
15
He
said
to
the
people
Get
ready
for
the
third
day
Abstain
from
sexual
relations
16
On
the
morning
of
the
third
day
there
was
thunder
and
lightning
and
there
was
a
heavy
cloud
on
the
mountain
and
a
very
loud
sound
of
a
horn
and
all
the
people
in
the
camp
began
to
tremble
17
Moses
now
brought
the
people
out
of
the
camp
to
meet
the
true
God
and
they
took
their
place
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
18
Mount
Sinai
smoked
all
over
because
Jehovah
came
down
upon
it
in
fire
and
its
smoke
was
rising
like
the
smoke
of
a
kiln
and
the
whole
mountain
was
trembling
violently
19
As
the
sound
of
the
horn
grew
louder
and
louder
Moses
spoke
and
the
voice
of
the
true
God
answered
him
20
So
Jehovah
came
down
upon
Mount
Sinai
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
Then
Jehovah
called
Moses
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
Moses
went
up
21
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Go
down
and
warn
the
people
not
to
try
to
force
their
way
through
to
look
at
Jehovah
or
many
of
them
will
perish
22
And
let
the
priests
who
regularly
come
near
to
Jehovah
sanctify
themselves
so
that
Jehovah
may
not
strike
them
23
Moses
then
said
to
Jehovah
The
people
are
not
able
to
come
up
to
Mount
Sinai
because
you
already
warned
us
saying
Set
boundaries
around
the
mountain
and
make
it
sacred
24
However
Jehovah
said
to
him
Go
descend
and
come
back
up
you
and
Aaron
with
you
but
do
not
let
the
priests
and
the
people
force
their
way
through
to
come
up
to
Jehovah
so
that
he
may
not
strike
them
25
So
Moses
descended
to
the
people
and
told
them
1
Then
God
spoke
all
these
words
2
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
out
of
the
house
of
slavery
3
You
must
not
have
any
other
gods
besides
me
4
You
must
not
make
for
yourself
a
carved
image
or
a
form
like
anything
that
is
in
the
heavens
above
or
on
the
earth
below
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
5
You
must
not
bow
down
to
them
nor
be
enticed
to
serve
them
for
I
Jehovah
your
God
am
a
God
who
requires
exclusive
devotion
bringing
punishment
for
the
error
of
fathers
upon
sons
upon
the
third
generation
and
upon
the
fourth
generation
of
those
who
hate
me
6
but
showing
loyal
love
to
the
thousandth
generation
of
those
who
love
me
and
keep
my
commandments
7
You
must
not
take
up
the
name
of
Jehovah
your
God
in
a
worthless
way
for
Jehovah
will
not
leave
unpunished
the
one
who
takes
up
His
name
in
a
worthless
way
8
Remember
the
Sabbath
day
to
keep
it
sacred
9
You
are
to
labor
and
do
all
your
work
for
six
days
10
but
the
seventh
day
is
a
sabbath
to
Jehovah
your
God
You
must
not
do
any
work
neither
you
nor
your
son
nor
your
daughter
nor
your
slave
man
nor
your
slave
girl
nor
your
domestic
animal
nor
your
foreign
resident
who
is
inside
your
settlements
11
For
in
six
days
Jehovah
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
the
sea
and
all
that
is
in
them
and
he
began
to
rest
on
the
seventh
day
That
is
why
Jehovah
blessed
the
Sabbath
day
and
made
it
sacred
12
Honor
your
father
and
your
mother
so
that
you
may
live
a
long
time
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
13
You
must
not
murder
14
You
must
not
commit
adultery
15
You
must
not
steal
16
You
must
not
testify
falsely
when
you
are
a
witness
against
your
fellow
man
17
You
must
not
desire
your
fellow
mans
house
You
must
not
desire
your
fellow
mans
wife
nor
his
slave
man
nor
his
slave
girl
nor
his
bull
nor
his
donkey
nor
anything
that
belongs
to
your
fellow
man
18
Now
all
the
people
were
witnessing
the
thunder
and
lightning
the
sound
of
the
horn
and
the
mountain
smoking
and
seeing
this
made
them
tremble
and
stand
at
a
distance
19
So
they
said
to
Moses
You
speak
with
us
and
we
will
listen
but
do
not
let
God
speak
with
us
for
fear
that
we
will
die
20
So
Moses
said
to
the
people
Do
not
be
afraid
for
the
true
God
has
come
to
put
you
to
the
test
in
order
that
the
fear
of
him
may
continue
with
you
so
that
you
may
not
sin
21
So
the
people
kept
standing
at
a
distance
but
Moses
went
near
to
the
dark
cloud
where
the
true
God
was
22
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
This
is
what
you
are
to
say
to
the
Israelites
You
have
seen
for
yourselves
that
I
spoke
with
you
from
heaven
23
You
must
not
make
gods
of
silver
alongside
me
and
you
must
not
make
gods
of
gold
for
yourselves
24
An
altar
of
earth
you
are
to
make
for
me
and
you
will
sacrifice
on
it
your
burnt
offerings
your
communion
sacrifices
your
flock
and
your
herd
In
every
place
where
I
cause
my
name
to
be
remembered
I
will
come
to
you
and
I
will
bless
you
25
If
you
make
an
altar
of
stones
for
me
you
must
not
build
it
using
stones
cut
with
tools
For
if
you
do
use
your
chisel
on
it
you
will
profane
it
26
And
you
must
not
go
up
by
steps
to
my
altar
that
your
private
parts
may
not
be
exposed
upon
it
1
These
are
the
judicial
decisions
that
you
are
to
convey
to
them
2
If
you
buy
a
Hebrew
slave
he
will
serve
as
a
slave
for
six
years
but
in
the
seventh
year
he
will
be
set
free
without
paying
anything
3
If
he
came
by
himself
he
will
go
out
by
himself
If
he
is
the
husband
of
a
wife
then
his
wife
must
go
out
with
him
4
If
his
master
gives
him
a
wife
and
she
bears
him
sons
or
daughters
the
wife
and
her
children
will
become
her
masters
and
he
will
go
out
by
himself
5
But
if
the
slave
should
insist
and
say
I
love
my
master
my
wife
and
my
sons
I
do
not
want
to
be
set
free

6
his
master
must
bring
him
before
the
true
God
Then
he
will
bring
him
up
against
the
door
or
the
doorpost
and
his
master
will
pierce
his
ear
through
with
an
awl
and
he
will
be
his
slave
for
life
7
If
a
man
sells
his
daughter
as
a
slave
she
will
not
go
free
the
same
way
that
a
slave
man
does
8
If
her
master
is
not
pleased
with
her
and
he
does
not
designate
her
as
a
concubine
but
causes
her
to
be
purchased
by
someone
else
he
will
not
be
entitled
to
sell
her
to
foreigners
for
he
has
betrayed
her
9
If
he
selects
her
for
his
son
he
is
to
grant
her
the
rights
of
a
daughter
10
If
he
takes
another
wife
for
himself
the
sustenance
the
clothing
and
the
marriage
due
of
the
first
wife
are
not
to
be
diminished
11
If
he
will
not
render
these
three
things
to
her
then
she
is
to
go
free
without
paying
any
money
12
Anyone
who
strikes
a
man
so
that
he
dies
must
be
put
to
death
13
But
if
he
does
it
unintentionally
and
the
true
God
lets
it
happen
I
will
designate
for
you
a
place
where
he
can
flee
14
If
a
man
becomes
very
angry
with
his
fellow
man
and
he
deliberately
kills
him
the
man
must
die
even
if
you
have
to
take
him
from
my
altar
15
One
who
strikes
his
father
or
his
mother
must
be
put
to
death
16
If
anyone
kidnaps
a
man
and
sells
him
or
is
caught
holding
him
he
must
be
put
to
death
17
Anyone
who
curses
his
father
or
his
mother
must
be
put
to
death
18
This
is
what
should
happen
if
men
quarrel
and
one
strikes
his
fellow
man
with
a
stone
or
a
fist
and
he
does
not
die
but
is
confined
to
his
bed
19
If
he
is
able
to
get
up
and
walk
around
outdoors
with
the
aid
of
a
staff
then
the
one
who
struck
him
must
be
free
from
punishment
He
will
only
make
compensation
for
the
time
the
injured
man
lost
from
his
work
until
he
is
completely
healed
20
If
a
man
strikes
his
slave
man
or
his
slave
girl
with
a
stick
and
that
one
dies
by
his
hand
that
one
must
be
avenged
21
However
if
he
survives
for
one
or
two
days
he
is
not
to
be
avenged
because
he
is
someone
bought
with
his
owners
money
22
If
men
should
struggle
with
each
other
and
they
hurt
a
pregnant
woman
and
she
gives
birth
prematurely
but
no
fatality
results
the
offender
must
pay
the
damages
imposed
on
him
by
the
husband
of
the
woman
and
he
must
pay
it
through
the
judges
23
But
if
a
fatality
does
occur
then
you
must
give
life
for
life
24
eye
for
eye
tooth
for
tooth
hand
for
hand
foot
for
foot
25
burn
for
burn
wound
for
wound
blow
for
blow
26
If
a
man
strikes
the
eye
of
his
slave
man
or
the
eye
of
his
slave
girl
and
he
destroys
it
he
is
to
let
the
slave
go
free
in
compensation
for
his
eye
27
And
if
he
knocks
out
the
tooth
of
his
slave
man
or
of
his
slave
girl
he
is
to
let
the
slave
go
free
in
compensation
for
his
tooth
28
If
a
bull
gores
a
man
or
a
woman
and
that
one
dies
the
bull
must
be
stoned
to
death
and
its
meat
is
not
to
be
eaten
but
the
owner
of
the
bull
is
free
from
punishment
29
But
if
a
bull
was
in
the
habit
of
goring
and
its
owner
had
been
warned
but
he
would
not
keep
it
under
guard
and
it
killed
a
man
or
a
woman
the
bull
is
to
be
stoned
and
its
owner
is
also
to
be
put
to
death
30
If
a
ransom
is
imposed
on
him
he
must
give
as
the
redemption
price
for
his
life
all
that
may
be
imposed
on
him
31
Whether
it
gored
a
son
or
a
daughter
it
is
to
be
done
to
the
bulls
owner
according
to
this
judicial
decision
32
If
the
bull
gored
a
slave
man
or
a
slave
girl
he
will
give
the
price
of
30
shekels
to
that
ones
master
and
the
bull
will
be
stoned
to
death
33
If
a
man
uncovers
or
digs
a
pit
and
does
not
cover
it
and
a
bull
or
a
donkey
falls
into
it
34
the
owner
of
the
pit
is
to
make
compensation
He
is
to
pay
the
price
to
its
owner
and
the
dead
animal
will
become
his
35
If
a
mans
bull
hurts
anothers
bull
and
it
dies
then
they
must
sell
the
live
bull
and
divide
the
price
paid
for
it
they
should
also
divide
the
dead
animal
36
Or
if
it
was
known
that
a
bull
had
been
in
the
habit
of
goring
but
its
owner
would
not
keep
it
under
guard
he
must
make
compensation
with
bull
for
bull
and
the
dead
one
will
become
his
own
1
If
a
man
steals
a
bull
or
a
sheep
and
he
slaughters
or
sells
it
he
is
to
compensate
with
five
bulls
for
the
bull
and
four
sheep
for
the
sheep
2
If
a
thief
is
found
in
the
act
of
breaking
in
and
he
gets
struck
and
dies
there
is
no
bloodguilt
for
him
3
But
if
it
happens
after
sunrise
there
is
bloodguilt
for
him
He
must
make
compensation
If
he
has
nothing
then
he
must
be
sold
for
the
things
he
stole
4
If
what
he
stole
is
found
alive
in
his
possession
whether
it
is
a
bull
or
a
donkey
or
a
sheep
he
is
to
make
double
compensation
5
If
anyone
puts
his
animals
out
to
graze
in
a
field
or
a
vineyard
and
lets
them
graze
in
someone
elses
field
he
is
to
make
compensation
with
the
best
of
his
own
field
or
with
the
best
of
his
own
vineyard
6
If
a
fire
starts
and
spreads
to
thornbushes
and
it
causes
sheaves
or
standing
grain
or
a
field
to
be
consumed
the
one
who
started
the
fire
must
make
compensation
for
what
was
burned
7
If
a
man
gives
his
fellow
man
money
or
articles
to
keep
and
these
are
stolen
from
the
fellow
mans
house
if
the
thief
is
found
he
must
make
double
compensation
8
If
the
thief
is
not
found
the
owner
of
the
house
must
be
brought
before
the
true
God
in
order
to
determine
whether
he
put
his
hand
on
the
goods
of
his
fellow
man
9
In
all
cases
of
illegal
possession
of
goods
concerning
a
bull
a
donkey
a
sheep
a
garment
or
anything
lost
of
which
he
may
say
This
is
mine
both
parties
will
present
their
case
before
the
true
God
The
one
whom
God
pronounces
guilty
is
to
make
double
compensation
to
his
fellow
man
10
If
a
man
gives
his
fellow
man
a
donkey
or
a
bull
or
a
sheep
or
any
domestic
animal
to
keep
and
it
dies
or
gets
maimed
or
gets
led
away
while
nobody
is
looking
11
there
should
be
an
oath
made
between
them
before
Jehovah
that
he
did
not
lay
his
hand
on
the
goods
of
his
fellow
man
and
the
owner
must
accept
it
The
other
man
is
not
to
make
compensation
12
But
if
the
animal
has
been
stolen
from
him
he
is
to
make
compensation
to
its
owner
13
If
it
was
torn
by
a
wild
animal
he
is
to
bring
it
as
evidence
He
is
not
to
make
compensation
for
something
torn
by
a
wild
animal
14
But
if
anybody
asks
to
borrow
an
animal
from
his
fellow
man
and
it
gets
maimed
or
it
dies
while
its
owner
is
not
with
it
the
man
who
borrowed
it
must
make
compensation
15
If
its
owner
is
with
it
he
is
not
to
make
compensation
If
it
was
hired
the
money
paid
for
the
hire
is
the
compensation
16
Now
if
a
man
seduces
a
virgin
who
is
not
engaged
and
he
lies
down
with
her
he
must
pay
the
bride-price
for
her
to
become
his
wife
17
If
her
father
absolutely
refuses
to
give
her
to
him
he
is
to
pay
the
money
at
the
rate
of
the
bride-price
18
You
must
not
allow
a
sorceress
to
live
19
Anyone
lying
down
with
an
animal
must
surely
be
put
to
death
20
Whoever
sacrifices
to
any
gods
but
Jehovah
alone
is
to
be
devoted
to
destruction
21
You
must
not
mistreat
a
foreign
resident
or
oppress
him
for
you
were
foreign
residents
in
the
land
of
Egypt
22
You
must
not
afflict
any
widow
or
fatherless
child
23
If
you
afflict
him
at
all
so
that
he
cries
out
to
me
I
will
unfailingly
hear
his
outcry
24
and
my
anger
will
blaze
and
I
will
kill
you
with
the
sword
and
your
wives
will
become
widows
and
your
children
will
be
fatherless
25
If
you
lend
money
to
anyone
poor
of
my
people
someone
who
is
dwelling
with
you
you
must
not
become
like
a
moneylender
to
him
You
must
not
charge
him
interest
26
If
you
seize
the
garment
of
your
fellow
man
as
security
for
a
loan
you
are
to
return
it
to
him
by
sunset
27
For
it
is
his
only
covering
his
clothing
to
cover
his
body
in
what
will
he
lie
down
to
sleep
When
he
cries
out
to
me
I
will
certainly
hear
for
I
am
compassionate
28
You
must
not
curse
God
nor
curse
a
chieftain
among
your
people
29
You
must
not
hesitate
to
make
offerings
from
your
abundant
produce
and
the
overflow
of
your
presses
The
firstborn
of
your
sons
you
are
to
give
to
me
30
This
is
what
you
should
do
with
your
bull
and
your
sheep
Seven
days
it
will
continue
with
its
mother
On
the
eighth
day
you
are
to
give
it
to
me
31
You
should
prove
yourselves
holy
people
to
me
and
you
must
not
eat
the
flesh
of
anything
in
the
field
that
has
been
torn
by
a
wild
animal
You
should
throw
it
to
the
dogs
1
You
must
not
spread
a
report
that
is
not
true
Do
not
cooperate
with
a
wicked
one
by
becoming
a
malicious
witness
2
You
must
not
follow
after
the
crowd
to
do
evil
and
you
must
not
pervert
justice
by
giving
testimony
to
go
along
with
the
crowd
3
You
must
show
impartiality
in
the
dispute
of
a
poor
person
4
If
you
come
upon
your
enemys
bull
or
his
donkey
straying
you
must
return
it
to
him
5
If
you
see
that
the
donkey
of
someone
who
hates
you
has
fallen
under
its
load
you
must
not
ignore
it
and
leave
You
must
help
him
release
the
animal
6
You
are
not
to
pervert
the
judgment
of
the
poor
one
among
you
in
his
legal
case
7
Have
nothing
to
do
with
a
false
accusation
and
do
not
kill
the
innocent
and
the
righteous
for
I
will
not
declare
the
wicked
one
righteous
8
You
must
not
accept
a
bribe
for
the
bribe
blinds
clear-sighted
men
and
can
distort
the
words
of
righteous
men
9
You
must
not
oppress
a
foreign
resident
You
know
how
it
feels
to
be
a
foreigner
because
you
were
foreign
residents
in
the
land
of
Egypt
10
You
are
to
sow
your
land
with
seed
and
gather
its
produce
for
six
years
11
But
the
seventh
year
you
should
leave
it
uncultivated
and
let
it
lie
fallow
and
the
poor
among
your
people
will
eat
of
it
and
what
they
leave
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
will
eat
That
is
what
you
should
do
with
your
vineyard
and
your
olive
grove
12
Six
days
you
are
to
do
your
work
but
on
the
seventh
day
you
are
to
cease
from
your
labor
in
order
that
your
bull
and
your
donkey
may
rest
and
the
son
of
your
slave
girl
and
the
foreign
resident
may
refresh
themselves
13
You
must
be
careful
to
do
all
that
I
have
said
to
you
and
you
must
not
mention
the
names
of
other
gods
they
should
not
be
heard
on
your
lips
14
Three
times
a
year
you
are
to
celebrate
a
festival
to
me
15
You
will
observe
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
You
will
eat
unleavened
bread
for
seven
days
just
as
I
have
commanded
you
at
the
appointed
time
in
the
month
of
Abib
for
at
that
time
you
came
out
of
Egypt
No
one
is
to
appear
before
me
empty-handed
16
Also
you
are
to
observe
the
Festival
of
Harvest
of
the
first
ripe
fruits
of
your
labors
of
what
you
sow
in
the
field
and
the
Festival
of
Ingathering
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
you
gather
in
from
the
field
the
results
of
your
labors
17
Three
times
a
year
all
your
men
are
to
appear
before
the
true
Lord
Jehovah
18
You
must
not
offer
the
blood
of
my
sacrifice
with
anything
leavened
And
the
sacrifices
of
fat
offered
at
my
festivals
should
not
stay
overnight
until
the
morning
19
You
are
to
bring
the
best
of
the
first
ripe
fruits
of
your
ground
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
your
God
You
must
not
boil
a
young
goat
in
its
mothers
milk
20
I
am
sending
an
angel
ahead
of
you
to
guard
you
on
the
way
and
to
bring
you
into
the
place
that
I
have
prepared
21
Pay
attention
to
him
and
obey
his
voice
Do
not
rebel
against
him
for
he
will
not
pardon
your
transgressions
because
my
name
is
in
him
22
However
if
you
strictly
obey
his
voice
and
do
all
that
I
say
I
will
show
hostility
to
your
enemies
and
oppose
those
who
oppose
you
23
For
my
angel
will
go
ahead
of
you
and
will
bring
you
to
the
Amorites
the
Hittites
the
Perizzites
the
Canaanites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
and
I
will
annihilate
them
24
You
must
not
bow
down
to
their
gods
or
be
persuaded
to
serve
them
and
you
must
not
imitate
their
practices
Instead
you
must
demolish
them
and
smash
their
sacred
pillars
25
You
must
serve
Jehovah
your
God
and
he
will
bless
your
bread
and
your
water
I
will
remove
sickness
from
among
you
26
The
women
in
your
land
will
not
suffer
a
miscarriage
or
be
barren
and
I
will
give
you
a
full
life
span
27
I
will
send
the
fear
of
me
ahead
of
you
and
I
will
throw
into
confusion
all
the
people
you
encounter
and
I
will
cause
all
your
enemies
to
flee
from
you
in
defeat
28
I
will
send
the
feeling
of
dejection
ahead
of
you
and
it
will
drive
the
Hivites
the
Canaanites
and
the
Hittites
out
from
before
you
29
I
will
not
drive
them
out
from
before
you
in
one
year
so
that
the
land
does
not
become
desolate
and
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
multiply
against
you
30
Little
by
little
I
will
drive
them
out
from
before
you
until
you
become
fruitful
and
take
possession
of
the
land
31
I
will
set
your
boundary
from
the
Red
Sea
to
the
sea
of
the
Philistines
and
from
the
wilderness
to
the
River
for
I
will
give
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
into
your
hand
and
you
will
drive
them
out
from
before
you
32
You
must
not
make
a
covenant
with
them
or
their
gods
33
They
should
not
dwell
in
your
land
so
that
they
may
not
cause
you
to
sin
against
me
If
you
should
serve
their
gods
it
would
surely
become
a
snare
to
you
1
Then
he
said
to
Moses
Go
up
to
Jehovah
you
and
Aaron
Nadab
and
Abihu
and
70
of
the
elders
of
Israel
and
bow
down
from
a
distance
2
Moses
should
approach
Jehovah
by
himself
but
the
others
should
not
approach
and
the
people
should
not
go
up
with
him
3
Then
Moses
came
and
related
to
the
people
all
the
words
of
Jehovah
and
all
the
judicial
decisions
and
all
the
people
answered
with
one
voice
All
the
words
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
we
are
willing
to
do
4
So
Moses
wrote
down
all
the
words
of
Jehovah
Then
he
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
built
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
an
altar
and
12
pillars
corresponding
to
the
12
tribes
of
Israel
5
After
that
he
sent
young
Israelite
men
and
they
offered
up
burnt
offerings
and
sacrificed
bulls
as
communion
sacrifices
to
Jehovah
6
Then
Moses
took
half
of
the
blood
and
put
it
in
bowls
and
half
of
the
blood
he
sprinkled
on
the
altar
7
Then
he
took
the
book
of
the
covenant
and
read
it
aloud
to
the
people
And
they
said
All
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
we
are
willing
to
do
and
we
will
be
obedient
8
So
Moses
took
the
blood
and
sprinkled
it
on
the
people
and
said
This
is
the
blood
of
the
covenant
that
Jehovah
has
made
with
you
in
harmony
with
all
these
words
9
Moses
and
Aaron
Nadab
and
Abihu
and
70
of
the
elders
of
Israel
went
up
10
and
they
saw
the
God
of
Israel
Under
his
feet
was
what
seemed
like
a
sapphire
pavement
and
it
was
as
pure
as
the
heavens
themselves
11
He
did
not
harm
the
distinguished
men
of
Israel
and
they
saw
a
vision
of
the
true
God
and
ate
and
drank
12
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Come
up
to
me
on
the
mountain
and
stay
there
I
will
give
you
the
stone
tablets
with
the
law
and
the
commandment
that
I
will
write
for
their
instruction
13
So
Moses
got
up
with
his
attendant
Joshua
and
Moses
went
up
the
mountain
of
the
true
God
14
But
to
the
elders
he
had
said
Wait
here
for
us
until
we
return
to
you
You
have
Aaron
and
Hur
with
you
Whoever
has
a
legal
case
may
go
to
them
15
Then
Moses
went
up
the
mountain
while
the
cloud
was
covering
it
16
Jehovahs
glory
remained
on
Mount
Sinai
and
the
cloud
covered
it
for
six
days
On
the
seventh
day
he
called
to
Moses
from
the
midst
of
the
cloud
17
To
the
Israelites
who
were
watching
the
appearance
of
Jehovahs
glory
was
like
a
consuming
fire
on
the
mountaintop
18
Moses
then
entered
into
the
cloud
and
went
up
the
mountain
And
Moses
stayed
on
the
mountain
40
days
and
40
nights
1
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
2
Tell
the
people
of
Israel
to
take
up
a
contribution
for
me
from
every
person
whose
heart
moves
him

are
to
take

8
They
are
to
make
a
sanctuary
for
me
and
I
will
reside
among
them
9
You
are
to

15
The

of
the
Ark
they

16
You

17
You

From
between

a
blue
cord
it
is
to
remain
on
the
front
of
the
turban
38
It
will
be
on

and
Aaron
will
bear
responsibility
when
someone
commits
an
error
against
the
holy
things
which
the
Israelites
sanctify
when
they
offer
them

when
they
come
into
the
tent
of
meeting

and
the
leg
of
the
sacred
portion
that
was
waved
and
that
was
taken
from
the
ram
of
installation
from
what
was
offered
for
Aaron
and
for
his
sons
28
It
is
to
become
Aarons
and
his
sons
by
a
permanent
regulation
to
be
carried
out
by
the
Israelites
for
it
is
a
sacred
portion
and
it
will
become
a
sacred
portion
to
be
given
by
the
Israelites
It
is
their
sacred
portion
for
Jehovah
from
their
communion
sacrifices
29
The
holy
garments
that
belong
to
Aaron
will
be
used
by
his
sons
after
him
when
they
are
anointed
and
installed
as
priests
30
The
priest
from
among
his
sons
who
succeeds
him
and
who
comes
into
the
tent
of
meeting
to
minister
in
the
holy
place
will
wear
them
for
seven
days
31
You
will
take
the
ram
of
installation
and
boil
its
flesh
in
a
holy
place
32
Aaron
and
his
sons
will
eat
the
flesh
of
the
ram
and
the
bread
that
is
in
the
basket
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
33
They
are
to
eat
the
things
with
which
atonement
was
made
to
install
them
as
priests
and
to
sanctify
them
But
an
unauthorized
person
may
not
eat
them
for
they
are
something
holy
34
If
any
of
the
flesh
of
the
installation
sacrifice
and
of
the
bread
is
left
over
until
the
morning
then
you
must
burn
what
is
left
with
fire
It
must
not
be
eaten
for
it
is
something
holy
35
You
are
to
do
this
way
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
according
to
all
that
I
have
commanded
you
You
will
take
seven
days
to
install
them
as
priests
36
You
will
offer
the
bull
of
the
sin
offering
daily
for
an
atonement
and
you
are
to
purify
the
altar
from
sin
by
making
atonement
for
it
and
you
must
anoint
it
to
sanctify
it
37
You
will
take
seven
days
to
make
atonement
for
the
altar
and
you
must
sanctify
it
so
that
it
may
become
a
most
holy
altar
Anyone
who
touches
the
altar
is
to
be
holy
38
This
is
what
you
will
offer
on
the
altar
two
one-year-old
rams
each
day
continually
39
Offer
the
one
young
ram
in
the
morning
and
the
other
ram
at
twilight
40
A
tenth
part
of
an
ephah
measure
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
a
fourth
of
a
hin
of
beaten
oil
and
a
drink
offering
of
a
fourth
of
a
hin
of
wine
will
go
for
the
first
young
ram
41
You
will
offer
the
second
young
ram
at
twilight
along
with
the
same
grain
and
drink
offerings
as
in
the
morning
You
will
render
it
as
a
pleasing
aroma
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
42
It
is
to
be
a
regular
burnt
offering
throughout
your
generations
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
before
Jehovah
where
I
will
present
myself
to
you
to
speak
to
you
there
43
I
will
present
myself
there
to
the
Israelites
and
it
will
be
sanctified
by
my
glory
44
I
will
sanctify
the
tent
of
meeting
and
the
altar
and
I
will
sanctify
Aaron
and
his
sons
so
that
they
may
serve
as
priests
to
me
45
I
will
reside
among
the
people
of
Israel
and
I
will
be
their
God
46
And
they
will
certainly
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
their
God
who
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
so
that
I
may
reside
among
them
I
am
Jehovah
their
God
1
You
are
to
make
an
altar
as
a
place
for
burning
incense
you
will
make
it
of
acacia
wood
2
It
should
be
square
one
cubit
long
one
cubit
wide
and
two
cubits
high
Its
horns
will
be
one
piece
with
it
3
You
are
to
overlay
it
with
pure
gold
its
top
surface
its
sides
all
around
and
its
horns
and
you
are
to
make
a
gold
border
around
it
4
You
will
also
make
two
rings
of
gold
for
it
below
its
border
on
two
opposite
sides
and
these
will
hold
the
poles
used
to
carry
it
5
Make
the
poles
of
acacia
wood
and
overlay
them
with
gold
6
You
are
to
put
it
before
the
curtain
that
is
near
the
ark
of
the
Testimony
before
the
cover
that
is
over
the
Testimony
where
I
will
present
myself
to
you
7
Aaron
will
burn
perfumed
incense
on
it
making
it
smoke
on
the
altar
when
he
maintains
the
lamps
each
morning
8
Also
when
Aaron
lights
the
lamps
at
twilight
he
will
burn
the
incense
It
is
a
regular
incense
offering
before
Jehovah
throughout
your
generations
9
You
must
not
offer
on
it
unauthorized
incense
or
a
burnt
offering
or
a
grain
offering
and
you
must
not
pour
a
drink
offering
on
it
10
Aaron
must
make
atonement
on
its
horns
once
a
year
With
some
of
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering
of
the
atonement
he
will
make
atonement
for
it
once
a
year
throughout
your
generations
It
is
most
holy
to
Jehovah
11
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
12
Whenever
you
take
a
census
and
count
the
sons
of
Israel
each
one
must
give
a
ransom
for
his
life
to
Jehovah
at
the
time
of
the
census
This
is
so
that
no
plague
may
be
brought
upon
them
when
they
are
registered
13
This
is
what
all
those
who
are
registered
will
give
a
half
shekel
by
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
Twenty
gerahs
equal
a
shekel
A
half
shekel
is
the
contribution
to
Jehovah
14
Everyone
registered
who
is
20
years
old
and
up
will
give
Jehovahs
contribution
15
The
rich
should
not
give
more
and
the
poor
should
not
give
less
than
the
half
shekel
as
a
contribution
to
Jehovah
to
make
atonement
for
your
lives
16
You
are
to
take
the
silver
money
of
the
atonement
from
the
Israelites
and
give
it
in
behalf
of
the
service
of
the
tent
of
meeting
that
it
may
serve
as
a
remembrance
before
Jehovah
for
the
Israelites
to
make
atonement
for
your
lives
17
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
18
Make
a
copper
basin
and
its
stand
for
washing
then
place
it
between
the
tent
of
meeting
and
the
altar
and
put
water
into
it
19
Aaron
and
his
sons
will
wash
their
hands
and
their
feet
there
20
When
they
go
into
the
tent
of
meeting
or
when
they
approach
the
altar
to
minister
and
to
make
offerings
of
fire
and
smoke
to
Jehovah
they
will
wash
with
water
so
that
they
do
not
die
21
They
must
wash
their
hands
and
their
feet
so
that
they
may
not
die
and
it
must
serve
as
a
permanent
regulation
for
them
for
him
and
his
offspring
throughout
their
generations
22
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
23
Next
take
the
choicest
perfumes
500
units
of
solidified
myrrh
and
half
that
amount
250
units
of
sweet
cinnamon
250
units
of
sweet
calamus
24
and
500
units
of
cassia
measured
by
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
along
with
a
hin
of
olive
oil
25
Then
make
out
of
it
a
holy
anointing
oil
it
should
be
skillfully
blended
together
It
is
to
be
a
holy
anointing
oil
26
You
are
to
anoint
the
tent
of
meeting
and
the
ark
of
the
Testimony
with
it
27
as
well
as
the
table
and
all
its
utensils
the
lampstand
and
its
utensils
the
altar
of
incense
28
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
and
all
its
utensils
and
the
basin
and
its
stand
29
You
must
sanctify
them
that
they
may
become
most
holy
Anyone
touching
them
is
to
be
holy
30
And
you
will
anoint
Aaron
and
his
sons
and
sanctify
them
to
serve
as
priests
to
me
31
You
will
speak
to
the
Israelites
saying
This
is
to
continue
as
a
holy
anointing
oil
to
me
during
your
generations
32
It
is
not
to
be
applied
to
the
flesh
of
mankind
and
you
must
not
make
anything
with
a
composition
like
it
It
is
something
holy
It
is
to
continue
as
something
holy
for
you
33
Anyone
who
makes
an
ointment
like
it
and
who
puts
some
of
it
on
an
unauthorized
person
must
be
cut
off
from
his
people
34
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Take
equal
portions
of
these
perfumes
stacte
drops
onycha
perfumed
galbanum
and
pure
frankincense
35
Make
it
into
an
incense
the
spice
mixture
should
be
skillfully
blended
salted
pure
and
holy
36
You
are
to
pound
some
of
it
into
fine
powder
and
put
some
of
it
before
the
Testimony
in
the
tent
of
meeting
where
I
will
present
myself
to
you
It
should
be
most
holy
to
you
37
You
must
not
make
for
your
own
use
the
incense
that
you
make
with
this
composition
You
are
to
regard
it
as
something
holy
to
Jehovah
38
Whoever
makes
any
like
it
to
enjoy
its
smell
must
be
cut
off
from
his
people
1
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
2
See
I
have
chosen
Bezalel
the
son
of
Uri
the
son
of
Hur
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
3
I
will
fill
him
with
the
spirit
of
God
giving
him
wisdom
understanding
and
knowledge
of
every
kind
of
craftsmanship
4
for
making
artistic
designs
for
working
with
gold
silver
and
copper
5
for
cutting
and
setting
stones
and
for
making
every
kind
of
wood
product
6
Moreover
to
assist
him
I
have
appointed
Oholiab
the
son
of
Ahisamach
of
the
tribe
of
Dan
and
I
am
putting
wisdom
into
the
heart
of
all
those
who
are
skillful
so
that
they
may
make
everything
I
have
commanded
you
7
the
tent
of
meeting
the
ark
of
the
Testimony
and
the
cover
that
is
on
it
all
the
utensils
of
the
tent
8
the
table
and
its
utensils
the
lampstand
of
pure
gold
and
all
its
utensils
the
altar
of
incense
9
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
and
all
its
utensils
the
basin
and
its
stand
10
the
finely
woven
garments
the
holy
garments
for
Aaron
the
priest
the
garments
of
his
sons
to
serve
as
priests
11
the
anointing
oil
and
the
perfumed
incense
for
the
sanctuary
They
will
do
everything
I
have
commanded
you
12
Jehovah
said
further
to
Moses
13
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
Especially
you
are
to
keep
my
sabbaths
for
it
is
a
sign
between
me
and
you
during
your
generations
in
order
that
you
may
know
that
I
Jehovah
am
sanctifying
you
14
You
must
keep
the
Sabbath
for
it
is
something
holy
to
you
Whoever
profanes
it
must
be
put
to
death
If
anyone
does
any
work
on
it
then
that
person
must
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people
15
Six
days
work
may
be
done
but
on
the
seventh
day
is
a
sabbath
of
complete
rest
It
is
something
holy
to
Jehovah
Anyone
doing
work
on
the
Sabbath
day
must
be
put
to
death
16
The
Israelites
must
keep
the
Sabbath
they
must
observe
the
Sabbath
during
all
their
generations
It
is
a
lasting
covenant
17
It
is
an
enduring
sign
between
me
and
the
people
of
Israel
for
in
six
days
Jehovah
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
on
the
seventh
day
he
rested
and
refreshed
himself
18
Now
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
speaking
with
him
on
Mount
Sinai
he
gave
Moses
two
tablets
of
the
Testimony
tablets
of
stone
written
on
by
Gods
finger
1
Meanwhile
the
people
saw
that
Moses
was
taking
a
long
time
coming
down
from
the
mountain
So
the
people
gathered
around
Aaron
and
said
to
him
Get
up
make
for
us
a
god
who
will
go
ahead
of
us
because
we
do
not
know
what
has
happened
to
this
Moses
the
man
who
led
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
2
At
this
Aaron
said
to
them
Take
the
gold
earrings
from
the
ears
of
your
wives
your
sons
and
your
daughters
and
bring
them
to
me
3
So
all
the
people
began
taking
off
the
gold
earrings
that
were
in
their
ears
and
bringing
them
to
Aaron
4
Then
he
took
the
gold
from
them
and
he
formed
it
with
an
engraving
tool
and
made
it
into
a
statue
of
a
calf
They
began
to
say
This
is
your
God
O
Israel
who
led
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
5
When
Aaron
saw
this
he
built
an
altar
before
it
Then
Aaron
called
out
There
is
a
festival
to
Jehovah
tomorrow
6
So
they
got
up
early
on
the
next
day
and
began
offering
up
burnt
offerings
and
presenting
communion
sacrifices
After
that
the
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink
Then
they
got
up
to
have
a
good
time
7
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Go
descend
because
your
people
whom
you
led
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
have
corrupted
themselves
8
They
have
quickly
deviated
from
the
way
I
commanded
them
to
go
They
have
made
for
themselves
a
statue
of
a
calf
and
they
keep
bowing
down
to
it
and
sacrificing
to
it
and
saying
This
is
your
God
O
Israel
who
led
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
9
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
to
Moses
I
have
seen
that
this
is
an
obstinate
people
10
So
now
let
me
be
and
I
will
exterminate
them
in
my
burning
anger
and
let
me
make
a
great
nation
from
you
instead
11
Then
Moses
appealed
to
Jehovah
his
God
and
said
Why
O
Jehovah
should
you
turn
your
burning
anger
against
your
people
after
bringing
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
great
power
and
with
a
mighty
hand
12
Why
should
the
Egyptians
say
He
had
evil
intentions
when
he
led
them
out
He
wanted
to
kill
them
in
the
mountains
and
exterminate
them
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
Turn
from
your
burning
anger
and
reconsider
your
decision
to
bring
this
calamity
on
your
people
13
Remember
your
servants
Abraham
Isaac
and
Israel
to
whom
you
swore
by
yourself
and
said
I
will
multiply
your
offspring
like
the
stars
of
the
heavens
and
I
will
give
all
this
land
that
I
have
designated
to
your
offspring
so
that
they
may
take
it
as
a
permanent
possession
14
So
Jehovah
began
to
reconsider
the
calamity
that
he
had
spoken
of
bringing
on
his
people
15
Moses
then
turned
and
went
down
from
the
mountain
with
the
two
tablets
of
the
Testimony
in
his
hand
The
tablets
were
inscribed
on
both
sides
they
were
written
on
the
front
and
on
the
back
16
The
tablets
were
the
workmanship
of
God
and
the
writing
was
the
writing
of
God
engraved
on
the
tablets
17
When
Joshua
began
to
hear
the
noise
of
the
people
because
of
their
shouting
he
said
to
Moses
There
is
the
sound
of
battle
in
the
camp
18
But
Moses
said
It
is
not
the
sound
of
singing
over
a
victory
And
it
is
not
the
sound
of
wailing
over
a
defeat
I
hear
the
sound
of
another
kind
of
singing
19
As
soon
as
Moses
got
near
the
camp
and
saw
the
calf
and
the
dances
his
anger
began
to
blaze
and
he
threw
the
tablets
from
his
hands
and
shattered
them
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
20
He
took
the
calf
that
they
had
made
and
he
burned
it
with
fire
and
crushed
it
into
powder
then
he
scattered
it
on
the
water
and
made
the
Israelites
drink
it
21
And
Moses
said
to
Aaron
What
did
this
people
do
to
you
that
you
have
brought
a
great
sin
upon
them
22
Aaron
replied
Do
not
be
enraged
my
lord
You
well
know
that
the
people
are
inclined
to
do
evil
23
So
they
said
to
me
Make
for
us
a
god
who
will
go
ahead
of
us
for
we
do
not
know
what
has
happened
to
this
Moses
the
man
who
led
us
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
24
So
I
said
to
them
Whoever
has
any
gold
must
take
it
off
and
give
it
to
me
Then
I
threw
it
into
the
fire
and
out
came
this
calf
25
Moses
saw
that
the
people
were
unrestrained
for
Aaron
had
let
them
go
unrestrained
so
that
they
were
a
disgrace
before
their
opposers
26
Then
Moses
took
his
position
in
the
gate
of
the
camp
and
said
Who
is
on
Jehovahs
side
Come
to
me
And
all
the
Levites
gathered
around
him
27
He
now
said
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
has
said
Each
of
you
must
fasten
on
his
sword
and
pass
through
all
the
camp
from
gate
to
gate
killing
his
brother
his
neighbor
and
his
close
companion
28
The
Levites
did
what
Moses
said
So
about
3000
men
were
killed
on
that
day
29
Then
Moses
said
Set
yourselves
apart
for
Jehovah
today
for
each
of
you
has
gone
against
his
own
son
and
his
own
brother
today
he
will
give
you
a
blessing
30
On
the
very
next
day
Moses
said
to
the
people
You
committed
a
very
great
sin
and
now
I
will
go
up
to
Jehovah
to
see
if
I
can
make
amends
for
your
sin
31
So
Moses
returned
to
Jehovah
and
said
What
a
great
sin
this
people
has
committed
They
made
themselves
a
god
of
gold
32
But
now
if
you
are
willing
pardon
their
sin
if
not
please
wipe
me
out
from
your
book
that
you
have
written
33
However
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Whoever
has
sinned
against
me
I
will
wipe
him
out
of
my
book
34
Go
now
lead
the
people
to
the
place
about
which
I
have
spoken
to
you
Look
My
angel
will
go
ahead
of
you
and
on
the
day
when
I
make
an
accounting
I
will
bring
punishment
on
them
for
their
sin
35
Then
Jehovah
began
plaguing
the
people
because
they
had
made
the
calf
the
one
that
Aaron
had
made
1
Jehovah
said
further
to
Moses
Go
on
your
way
from
here
with
the
people
whom
you
led
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
Journey
to
the
land
about
which
I
swore
to
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
saying
To
your
offspring
I
will
give
it
2
I
will
send
an
angel
ahead
of
you
and
drive
out
the
Canaanites
the
Amorites
the
Hittites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
3
Go
up
to
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
But
I
will
not
go
in
the
midst
of
you
for
you
are
an
obstinate
people
and
I
might
exterminate
you
on
the
way
4
When
the
people
heard
this
harsh
word
they
began
to
mourn
and
not
one
of
them
put
on
his
ornaments
5
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Say
to
the
Israelites
You
are
an
obstinate
people
In
one
moment
I
could
go
through
the
midst
of
you
and
exterminate
you
So
now
keep
your
ornaments
off
while
I
consider
what
to
do
to
you
6
So
from
Mount
Horeb
onward
the
Israelites
refrained
from
wearing
their
ornaments
7
Now
Moses
took
his
tent
and
pitched
it
outside
the
camp
at
some
distance
from
the
camp
and
he
called
it
a
tent
of
meeting
Everyone
inquiring
of
Jehovah
would
go
out
to
the
tent
of
meeting
which
was
outside
the
camp
8
As
soon
as
Moses
went
out
to
the
tent
all
the
people
would
rise
and
stand
at
the
entrance
of
their
own
tents
and
they
would
gaze
after
Moses
until
he
entered
into
the
tent
9
As
soon
as
Moses
would
go
into
the
tent
the
pillar
of
cloud
would
come
down
and
stand
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
while
God
spoke
with
Moses
10
When
all
the
people
saw
the
pillar
of
cloud
standing
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
each
of
them
rose
and
bowed
down
at
the
entrance
of
his
own
tent
11
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
face-to-face
just
as
one
man
would
speak
to
another
man
When
he
returned
to
the
camp
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
his
minister
and
attendant
would
not
depart
from
the
tent
12
Now
Moses
said
to
Jehovah
See
you
are
saying
to
me
Lead
this
people
up

but
you
have
not
let
me
know
whom
you
will
send
with
me
Moreover
you
have
said
I
know
you
by
name
and
you
have
also
found
favor
in
my
eyes
13
Please
if
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
make
me
know
your
ways
so
that
I
may
know
you
and
continue
to
find
favor
in
your
eyes
Consider
too
that
this
nation
is
your
people
14
So
he
said
I
myself
will
go
with
you
and
I
will
give
you
rest
15
Then
Moses
said
to
him
If
you
yourself
are
not
going
along
do
not
lead
us
up
from
here
16
How
will
it
be
known
that
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
I
and
your
people
Is
it
not
by
your
going
along
with
us
so
that
I
and
your
people
will
be
distinguished
from
every
other
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
17
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
to
Moses
I
will
also
do
this
thing
that
you
request
because
you
have
found
favor
in
my
eyes
and
I
know
you
by
name
18
Then
he
said
Please
show
me
your
glory
19
But
he
said
I
will
make
all
my
goodness
pass
before
your
face
and
I
will
declare
before
you
the
name
of
Jehovah
and
I
will
favor
the
one
whom
I
favor
and
I
will
show
mercy
to
the
one
to
whom
I
show
mercy
20
But
he
added
You
cannot
see
my
face
for
no
man
can
see
me
and
live
21
Jehovah
said
further
Here
is
a
place
near
me
Station
yourself
on
the
rock
22
When
my
glory
is
passing
by
I
will
place
you
in
a
crevice
of
the
rock
and
I
will
shield
you
with
my
hand
until
I
have
passed
by
23
After
that
I
will
take
my
hand
away
and
you
will
see
my
back
But
my
face
may
not
be
seen
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Carve
out
for
yourself
two
tablets
of
stone
like
the
first
ones
and
I
will
write
on
the
tablets
the
words
that
appeared
on
the
first
tablets
which
you
shattered
2
Get
ready
for
the
morning
as
you
will
go
up
in
the
morning
to
Mount
Sinai
and
station
yourself
before
me
there
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
3
But
nobody
may
go
up
with
you
and
nobody
else
should
be
seen
anywhere
on
the
mountain
Not
even
the
flocks
or
herds
should
graze
in
front
of
that
mountain
4
So
Moses
carved
out
two
tablets
of
stone
like
the
first
ones
and
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
went
up
Mount
Sinai
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
and
he
took
the
two
tablets
of
stone
in
his
hand
5
Then
Jehovah
came
down
in
the
cloud
and
stationed
himself
with
him
there
and
declared
the
name
of
Jehovah
6
Jehovah
was
passing
before
him
and
declaring
Jehovah
Jehovah
a
God
merciful
and
compassionate
slow
to
anger
and
abundant
in
loyal
love
and
truth
7
showing
loyal
love
to
thousands
pardoning
error
and
transgression
and
sin
but
he
will
by
no
means
leave
the
guilty
unpunished
bringing
punishment
for
the
error
of
fathers
upon
sons
and
upon
grandsons
upon
the
third
generation
and
upon
the
fourth
generation
8
Moses
hurried
to
bow
low
to
the
earth
and
prostrate
himself
9
Then
he
said
If
now
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
O
Jehovah
then
please
Jehovah
go
along
with
us
in
our
midst
although
we
are
an
obstinate
people
and
forgive
our
error
and
our
sin
and
take
us
as
your
own
possession
10
In
turn
he
said
Here
I
am
making
a
covenant
Before
all
your
people
I
will
do
wonderful
things
that
have
never
been
done
in
all
the
earth
or
among
all
the
nations
and
all
the
people
among
whom
you
live
will
see
the
work
of
Jehovah
for
it
is
an
awe-inspiring
thing
that
I
am
doing
with
you
11
Pay
attention
to
what
I
am
commanding
you
today
Here
I
am
driving
out
from
before
you
the
Amorites
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
12
Be
careful
that
you
do
not
make
a
covenant
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
to
which
you
are
going
or
it
may
prove
to
be
a
snare
among
you
13
But
you
are
to
pull
down
their
altars
you
are
to
shatter
their
sacred
pillars
and
their
sacred
poles
you
are
to
cut
down
14
You
must
not
bow
down
to
another
god
for
Jehovah
is
known
for
requiring
exclusive
devotion
Yes
he
is
a
God
who
requires
exclusive
devotion
15
Be
careful
not
to
make
a
covenant
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
because
when
they
prostitute
themselves
to
their
gods
and
sacrifice
to
their
gods
someone
will
invite
you
and
you
will
eat
from
his
sacrifice
16
Then
you
will
surely
take
some
of
their
daughters
for
your
sons
and
their
daughters
will
prostitute
themselves
to
their
gods
and
cause
your
sons
to
prostitute
themselves
to
their
gods
17
You
must
not
make
gods
of
cast
metal
18
You
are
to
observe
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
You
will
eat
unleavened
bread
just
as
I
have
commanded
you
do
this
for
seven
days
at
the
appointed
time
in
the
month
of
Abib
because
it
was
in
the
month
of
Abib
that
you
came
out
of
Egypt
19
Every
firstborn
male
is
mine
including
all
your
livestock
whether
the
first
male
bull
or
sheep
20
The
firstling
of
a
donkey
you
are
to
redeem
with
a
sheep
But
if
you
do
not
redeem
it
then
you
must
break
its
neck
You
are
to
redeem
every
firstborn
of
your
sons
No
one
may
appear
before
me
empty-handed
21
Six
days
you
are
to
work
but
on
the
seventh
day
you
will
rest
Even
during
plowing
time
and
in
harvest
you
will
rest
22
And
you
will
celebrate
your
Festival
of
Weeks
with
the
first
ripe
fruits
of
the
wheat
harvest
and
the
Festival
of
Ingathering
at
the
turn
of
the
year
23
Three
times
a
year
all
your
men
are
to
appear
before
the
true
Lord
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
24
For
I
will
drive
the
nations
away
from
before
you
and
I
will
enlarge
your
territory
and
nobody
will
desire
your
land
while
you
are
going
up
to
see
the
face
of
Jehovah
your
God
three
times
a
year
25
You
must
not
offer
the
blood
of
my
sacrifice
along
with
anything
leavened
The
sacrifice
of
the
festival
of
the
Passover
should
not
be
kept
overnight
until
the
morning
26
The
best
of
the
first
ripe
fruits
of
your
soil
you
are
to
bring
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
your
God
You
must
not
boil
a
young
goat
in
its
mothers
milk
27
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
to
Moses
You
are
to
write
down
these
words
because
in
accordance
with
these
words
I
am
making
a
covenant
with
you
and
with
Israel
28
And
he
remained
there
with
Jehovah
40
days
and
40
nights
He
ate
no
bread
and
drank
no
water
And
He
wrote
on
the
tablets
the
words
of
the
covenant
the
Ten
Commandments
29
Moses
then
came
down
from
Mount
Sinai
and
the
two
tablets
of
the
Testimony
were
in
his
hand
When
he
came
down
from
the
mountain
Moses
did
not
know
that
the
skin
of
his
face
was
emitting
rays
because
he
had
been
speaking
with
God
30
When
Aaron
and
all
the
Israelites
saw
Moses
they
noticed
that
the
skin
of
his
face
emitted
rays
and
they
were
afraid
to
go
near
him
31
But
Moses
called
to
them
so
Aaron
and
all
the
chieftains
of
the
assembly
came
to
him
and
Moses
spoke
with
them
32
After
that
all
the
Israelites
came
near
to
him
and
he
gave
them
all
the
commands
that
Jehovah
had
given
him
on
Mount
Sinai
33
When
Moses
would
finish
speaking
with
them
he
would
put
a
veil
over
his
face
34
But
when
Moses
would
go
in
before
Jehovah
to
speak
with
him
he
would
take
off
the
veil
until
he
went
out
Then
he
went
out
and
revealed
to
the
Israelites
the
commands
he
had
received
35
And
the
Israelites
saw
that
the
skin
of
Moses
face
emitted
rays
then
Moses
put
the
veil
back
over
his
face
until
he
went
in
to
speak
with
God
1
Moses
later
gathered
the
entire
assembly
of
the
Israelites
together
and
said
to
them
These
are
the
things
that
Jehovah
has
commanded
to
be
done
2
Work
may
be
done
for
six
days
but
the
seventh
day
will
become
something
holy
to
you
a
sabbath
of
complete
rest
to
Jehovah
Anybody
doing
work
on
it
will
be
put
to
death
3
You
must
not
light
a
fire
in
any
of
your
dwelling
places
on
the
Sabbath
day
4
Moses
then
said
to
the
entire
assembly
of
the
Israelites
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
commanded
5
Take
up
a
contribution
for
Jehovah
from

and

for

and
the

10
Let
all
who
are
skilled
among
you
come
and
make
everything
that
Jehovah
has
commanded
11
namely
the
tabernacle
with
its
tent
and
its
covering

and
its

and
its

and

in
the
sanctuary
the
holy
garments
for
Aaron
the
priest
and
the
garments
of
his
sons
for
serving
as
priests
20
So
all
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
went
out
from
before
Moses
21
Then
everyone
whose
heart
impelled
him
and
everyone
whose
spirit
incited
him
came
and
brought
their
contribution
for
Jehovah
to
be
used
for
the
tent
of
meeting
for
all
its
service
and
for
the
holy
garments
22
They
kept
coming
the
men
along
with
the
women
each
with
a
willing
heart
bringing
brooches
earrings
rings
and
other
jewelry
as
well
as

all

And
all
who
had
blue
thread

linen
goat
hair

dyed
red
and
sealskins
brought
them
24
All
those
contributing

and

brought
Jehovahs
contribution
and
all
who
had
acacia
wood
for
any
part
of
the
work
brought
it
25
All
the
skilled
women
spun
with
their
hands
and
they
brought
what
they
had
spun
blue
thread
purple
wool
scarlet
material
and
fine
linen
26
And
all
the
skilled
women
whose
hearts
impelled
them
spun
the
goat
hair
27
And
the
chieftains
brought
onyx
stones
and
other
stones
to
be
set
in
the
ephod
and
the
breastpiece
28
and
the
balsam
and
the
oil
for
lighting
and
for
the
anointing
oil
and
for
the
perfumed
incense
29
All
the
men
and
women
whose
hearts
incited
them
brought
something
for
the
work
that
Jehovah
through
Moses
had
commanded
to
be
done
the
Israelites
brought
it
as
a
voluntary
offering
to
Jehovah
30
Then
Moses
said
to
the
Israelites
See
Jehovah
has
chosen
Bezalel
the
son
of
Uri
the
son
of
Hur
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
31
He
has
filled
him
with
the
spirit
of
God
giving
him
wisdom
understanding
and
knowledge
of
every
sort
of
craftsmanship
32
for
making
artistic
designs
for
working
with
gold
silver
and
copper
33
for
cutting
and
setting
stones
and
for
making
all
kinds
of
artistic
wood
products
34
And
he
has
put
it
into
his
heart
to
teach
he
and
Oholiab
the
son
of
Ahisamach
of
the
tribe
of
Dan
35
He
has
filled
them
with
skill
to
do
all
the
work
of
a
craftsman
an
embroiderer
and
a
weaver
using
blue
thread
purple
wool
scarlet
material
and
fine
linen
and
of
a
loom
worker
These
men
will
do
every
sort
of
work
and
prepare
every
sort
of
design
1
Bezalel
will
work
along
with
Oholiab
and
every
skilled
man
to
whom
Jehovah
has
given
wisdom
and
understanding
so
as
to
know
how
to
do
all
the
work
of
the
holy
service
just
as
Jehovah
has
commanded
2
Moses
then
called
Bezalel
and
Oholiab
and
every
skilled
man
into
whose
heart
Jehovah
had
put
wisdom
everyone
whose
heart
impelled
him
to
volunteer
to
do
the
work
3
Then
they
took
from
Moses
all
the
contribution
that
the
Israelites
had
brought
for
the
work
of
the
holy
service
However
these
continued
to
bring
him
voluntary
offerings
morning
after
morning
4
Then
after
they
started
the
holy
work
all
the
skilled
workers
were
coming
one
after
another
5
and
they
were
telling
Moses
The
people
are
bringing
much
more
than
what
is
required
for
the
work
that
Jehovah
has
commanded
to
be
done
6
So
Moses
commanded
that
an
announcement
be
made
throughout
the
camp
saying
Men
and
women
do
not
bring
any
more
goods
for
the
holy
contribution
With
that
the
people
were
restrained
from
bringing
in
anything
else
7
The
goods
were
enough
for
all
the
work
to
be
done
and
more
than
enough
8
So
all
the
skilled
workers
made
the
tabernacle
of
ten
tent
cloths
of
fine
twisted
linen
blue
thread
purple
wool
and
scarlet
material
he
made
them
with
cherubs
embroidered
on
them
9
Each
tent
cloth
was
28
cubits
long
and
4
cubits
wide
All
the
tent
cloths
were
the
same
size
10
Then
he
joined
five
of
the
tent
cloths
together
and
the
other
five
tent
cloths
he
joined
together
11
After
that
he
made
loops
of
blue
thread
on
the
edge
of
the
one
tent
cloth
where
it
would
join
He
did
the
same
on
the
edge
of
the
outermost
tent
cloth
at
the
corresponding
place
where
it
would
join
12
He
made
50
loops
on
the
one
tent
cloth
and
50
loops
on
the
other
edge
of
the
tent
cloth
at
the
place
where
it
would
join
so
that
the
loops
would
be
opposite
one
another
13
Finally
he
made
50
gold
clasps
and
joined
the
tent
cloths
together
with
the
clasps
so
that
the
tabernacle
became
one
unit
14
Then
he
made
tent
cloths
of
goat
hair
for
the
tent
over
the
tabernacle
He
made
11
tent
cloths
15
Each
tent
cloth
was
30
cubits
long
and
4
cubits
wide
The
11
tent
cloths
were
the
same
size
16
Then
he
joined
five
of
the
tent
cloths
together
and
he
joined
the
other
six
tent
cloths
together
17
Next
he
made
50
loops
along
the
edge
of
the
outermost
tent
cloth
where
it
joined
and
he
made
50
loops
along
the
edge
of
the
other
tent
cloth
that
joined
with
it
18
And
he
made
50
copper
clasps
for
joining
the
tent
together
to
become
one
unit
19
He
made
a
covering
for
the
tent
out
of
ram
skins
dyed
red
and
a
covering
out
of
sealskins
to
go
over
that
20
Then
he
made
out
of
acacia
wood
the
tabernacles
panel
frames
which
stood
upright
21
Each
panel
frame
was
ten
cubits
high
and
one
and
a
half
cubits
wide
22
Each
panel
frame
had
two
tenons
joined
to
each
other
That
is
how
he
made
all
the
panel
frames
of
the
tabernacle
23
Thus
he
made
the
panel
frames
for
the
south
side
of
the
tabernacle
20
panel
frames
facing
south
24
Then
he
made
40
socket
pedestals
of
silver
to
go
under
the
20
panel
frames
two
socket
pedestals
beneath
one
panel
frame
for
its
two
tenons
and
two
socket
pedestals
under
each
following
panel
frame
for
its
two
tenons
25
For
the
other
side
of
the
tabernacle
the
northern
side
he
made
20
panel
frames
26
and
their
40
socket
pedestals
of
silver
two
socket
pedestals
beneath
the
one
panel
frame
and
two
socket
pedestals
beneath
each
of
the
other
panel
frames
27
For
the
rear
section
of
the
tabernacle
to
the
west
he
made
six
panel
frames
28
He
made
two
panel
frames
as
corner
posts
of
the
tabernacle
at
the
two
rear
corners
29
The
posts
were
doubled
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
up
to
the
first
ring
That
is
what
he
did
with
the
two
corner
posts
30
So
they
amounted
to
eight
panel
frames
along
with
their
16
socket
pedestals
of
silver
two
socket
pedestals
under
each
panel
frame
31
Then
he
made
bars
of
acacia
wood
five
bars
for
the
panel
frames
of
the
one
side
of
the
tabernacle
32
and
five
bars
for
the
panel
frames
of
the
other
side
of
the
tabernacle
and
five
for
the
panel
frames
of
the
tabernacle
for
the
rear
section
to
the
west
33
Then
he
made
the
middle
bar
to
extend
along
the
middle
of
the
panel
frames
from
one
end
to
the
other
34
He
overlaid
the
panel
frames
with
gold
and
he
made
their
rings
of
gold
as
holders
for
the
bars
and
he
overlaid
the
bars
with
gold
35
Then
he
made
a
curtain
of
blue
thread
purple
wool
scarlet
material
and
fine
twisted
linen
He
made
it
with
cherubs
embroidered
on
it
36
Then
he
made
for
it
four
acacia
pillars
and
overlaid
them
with
gold
along
with
hooks
of
gold
and
cast
four
socket
pedestals
of
silver
for
them
37
Next
he
made
a
screen
for
the
entrance
of
the
tent
out
of
blue
thread
purple
wool
scarlet
material
and
fine
twisted
linen
woven
together
38
as
well
as
its
five
pillars
and
their
hooks
He
overlaid
their
tops
and
their
connectors
with
gold
but
their
five
socket
pedestals
were
of
copper
1
Bezalel
then
made
the
Ark
of
acacia
wood
It
was
two
and
a
half
cubits
long
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
wide
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
high
2
He
overlaid
it
with
pure
gold
inside
and
outside
and
made
a
border
of
gold
around
it
3
After
that
he
cast
four
rings
of
gold
for
it
for
above
its
four
feet
with
two
rings
on
its
one
side
and
two
rings
on
its
other
side
4
He
next
made
poles
of
acacia
wood
and
overlaid
them
with
gold
5
Then
he
put
the
poles
through
the
rings
on
the
sides
of
the
Ark
for
carrying
the
Ark
6
He
made
the
cover
of
pure
gold
It
was
two
and
a
half
cubits
long
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
wide
7
He
then
made
two
cherubs
of
hammered
gold
on
both
ends
of
the
cover
8
One
cherub
was
on
one
end
and
the
other
cherub
on
the
other
end
He
made
the
cherubs
on
both
ends
of
the
cover
9
The
two
cherubs
spread
out
their
wings
upward
overshadowing
the
cover
with
their
wings
They
were
facing
each
other
and
their
faces
were
turned
toward
the
cover
10
He
then
made
the
table
of
acacia
wood
It
was
two
cubits
long
a
cubit
wide
and
a
cubit
and
a
half
high
11
And
he
overlaid
it
with
pure
gold
and
made
a
border
of
gold
around
it
12
Next
he
made
a
rim
the
width
of
a
handbreadth
to
go
around
it
and
a
border
of
gold
to
go
around
the
rim
13
Further
he
cast
four
rings
of
gold
for
it
and
placed
the
rings
on
the
four
corners
where
the
four
legs
were
attached
14
The
rings
were
near
the
rim
as
holders
for
the
poles
used
for
carrying
the
table
15
Then
he
made
the
poles
of
acacia
wood
and
overlaid
them
with
gold
for
carrying
the
table
16
After
that
he
made
out
of
pure
gold
the
utensils
that
went
on
the
table—its
dishes
its
cups
its
bowls
and
its
pitchers
from
which
drink
offerings
would
be
poured
17
Then
he
made
the
lampstand
of
pure
gold
He
made
the
lampstand
of
hammered
work
Its
base
its
stem
its
cups
its
knobs
and
its
blossoms
were
one
piece
18
Six
branches
were
extending
out
from
its
stem
three
branches
of
the
lampstand
from
its
one
side
and
three
branches
from
its
other
side
19
Three
cups
shaped

flowers
were
on
the
one
set
of
branches
with
knobs
and
blossoms
alternating
and
three
cups

of
the
lampstand
20
And
on
the
stem
of
the
lampstand
were
four
cups
shaped
like
almond
flowers
with
knobs
and
blossoms
alternating
21
There
was
a
knob
under
the

two
branches
that
extended
out
of
the
stem
and
a
knob
under
the
next
two
branches
and
a
knob
under
the
next
two

from
the
stem
of
the
lampstand
22
The
knobs
and
the
branches
and
the
whole
lampstand
were
made
to
be
one
piece
of

hammered
gold
23
Then
he
made
its
seven
lamps
and
its
snuffers
and
its
fire
holders
out
of
pure
gold
24
He
made
it
along
with
all

25
He
now
made

It
was
square

its
horns
and
he
made
a

for
it
below
its
border
on
two
opposite
sides
to
hold

of
the
Testimony
which
was
inventoried
at
the
command
of
Moses
as
the
responsibility
of
the

of
Ithamar
the

22
Bezalel

24
All
the
gold
that

used
for
all
the

equaled
the

shekel
of

and
1775
shekels
by
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
26
The
half

for
each
individual
was
half
a
shekel
by
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
for
every
man
who
was
among
those
registered
from
20

and
joined
them
together

From
the
blue
thread
the
purple
wool
and
the
scarlet
material
they
made
finely
woven
garments
for
ministering
in
the
holy
place
They
made
the
holy
garments
that
were
for
Aaron
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
2
He
made
the
ephod
of
gold
blue
thread
purple
wool
scarlet
material
and
fine
twisted
linen
3
They
hammered
plates
of
gold
into
thin
sheets
and
he
cut
it
into
threads
to
work
in
with
the
blue
thread
the
purple
wool
the
scarlet
material
and
the
fine
linen
and
it
was
embroidered
4
They
made
shoulder
pieces
for
it
that
were
attached
and
it
was
joined
to
them
at
its
two
edges
5
And
the
woven
belt
which
was
attached
to
the
ephod
for
tying
it
securely
in
position
was
made
of
the
same
material
of
gold
blue
thread
purple
wool
scarlet
material
and
fine
twisted
linen
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
6
Then
they
mounted
the
onyx
stones
in
gold
settings
and
they
engraved
them
with
the
names
of
the
sons
of
Israel
as
they
would
engrave
a
seal
7
He
placed
them
on
the
shoulder
pieces
of
the
ephod
as
memorial
stones
for
the
sons
of
Israel
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
8
Then
he
made
the
breastpiece
with
the
workmanship
of
an
embroiderer
like
the
workmanship
of
the
ephod
out
of
gold
blue
thread
purple
wool
scarlet
material
and
fine
twisted
linen
9
It
was
square
when
doubled
They
made
the
breastpiece
which
when
doubled
was
as
long
and
as
wide
as
the
span
of
the
hand
10
They
set
four
rows
of
stones
in
it
The
first
row
was
ruby
topaz
and
emerald
11
The
second
row
was
turquoise
sapphire
and
jasper
12
The
third
row
was
leshem
stone
agate
and
amethyst
13
And
the
fourth
row
was
chrysolite
onyx
and
jade
They
were
mounted
in
settings
of
gold
14
The
stones
corresponded
to
the
names
of
the
12
sons
of
Israel
and
the
names
were
engraved
like
a
seal
each
name
representing
one
of
the
12
tribes
15
Then
they
made
wreathed
chains
on
the
breastpiece
like
cords
of
pure
gold
16
And
they
made
two
settings
of
gold
and
two
rings
of
gold
and
attached
the
two
rings
to
the
two
corners
of
the
breastpiece
17
After
that
they
put
the
two
cords
of
gold
through
the
two
rings
at
the
corners
of
the
breastpiece
18
Then
they
put
the
two
ends
of
the
two
cords
through
the
two
settings
and
attached
them
to
the
shoulder
pieces
on
the
front
of
the
ephod
19
Next
they
made
two
rings
of
gold
and
set
them
at
the
two
ends
on
the
inside
edge
of
the
breastpiece
facing
the
ephod
20
Then
they
made
two
more
rings
of
gold
and
put
them
on
the
front
of
the
ephod
below
the
two
shoulder
pieces
close
to
where
it
is
joined
above
the
woven
belt
of
the
ephod
21
Finally
they
tied
the
breastpiece
with
a
blue
cord
from
its
rings
to
the
rings
of
the
ephod
in
order
to
keep
the
breastpiece
in
its
place
on
the
ephod
above
the
woven
belt
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
22
Then
he
made
the
sleeveless
coat
of
the
ephod
woven
by
a
loom
worker
all
of
blue
thread
23
The
opening
of
the
sleeveless
coat
was
in
the
middle
of
it
like
the
opening
of
a
coat
of
mail
Its
opening
had
a
border
around
it
so
that
it
would
not
be
torn
24
Next
they
made
on
the
hem
of
the
sleeveless
coat
pomegranates
of
blue
thread
purple
wool
and
scarlet
material
twisted
together
25
And
they
made
bells
of
pure
gold
and
put
the
bells
in
between
the
pomegranates
all
around
the
hem
of
the
sleeveless
coat
in
between
the
pomegranates
26
they
alternated
a
bell
and
a
pomegranate
a
bell
and
a
pomegranate
all
around
the
hem
of
the
sleeveless
coat
which
was
used
for
ministering
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
27
And
they
made
the
robes
of
fine
linen
woven
by
a
loom
worker
for
Aaron
and
his
sons
28
and
the
turban
of
fine
linen
the
ornamental
headgear
of
fine
linen
the
linen
shorts
of
fine
twisted
linen
29
and
the
sash
of
fine
twisted
linen
blue
thread
purple
wool
and
scarlet
material
woven
together
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
30
Finally
they
made
the
shining
plate
the
holy
sign
of
dedication
out
of
pure
gold
and
inscribed
on
it
an
inscription
as
one
would
engrave
a
seal
Holiness
belongs
to
Jehovah
31
They
attached
to
it
a
cord
made
from
blue
thread
in
order
to
put
it
on
the
turban
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
32
So
all
the
work
for
the
tabernacle
the
tent
of
meeting
was
completed
and
the
Israelites
did
everything
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
They
did
just
so
33
Then
they
brought
the
tabernacle
to
Moses

tent

all
its
utensils

panel
frames

in
the
sanctuary
the
holy
garments
for

and
the

of
his
sons
for

42
According
to
all
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
that
was
how
the
Israelites
did
all
the
work
43
When
Moses
inspected
all
their
work
he
saw
that
they
had
done
it
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
and
Moses
blessed
them
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
2
On
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
you
are
to
set
up
the
tabernacle
the
tent
of
meeting
3
Place
the
ark
of
the
Testimony
in
it
and
screen
off
the
Ark
with
the
curtain
4
You
are
to
bring
the
table
in
and
arrange
the
things
that
belong
on
it
and
bring
in
the
lampstand
and
light
its
lamps
5
Then
put
the
golden
altar
for
incense
before
the
ark
of
the
Testimony
and
put
the
screen
for
the
entrance
of
the
tabernacle
in
place
6
You
are
to
put
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
before
the
entrance
of
the
tabernacle
the
tent
of
meeting
7
and
place
the
basin
between
the
tent
of
meeting
and
the
altar
and
put
water
in
it
8
Then
set
up
the
courtyard
around
it
and
put
up
the
screen
for
the
entrance
of
the
courtyard
9
Next
you
are
to
take
the
anointing
oil
and
anoint
the
tabernacle
and
all
that
is
in
it
and
sanctify
it
and
all
its
utensils
so
that
it
will
become
something
holy
10
You
are
to
anoint
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
and
all
its
utensils
and
sanctify
the
altar
so
that
it
will
become
a
most
holy
altar
11
And
anoint
the
basin
and
its
stand
and
sanctify
it
12
Then
bring
Aaron
and
his
sons
near
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
wash
them
with
water
13
And
you
are
to
clothe
Aaron
with
the
holy
garments
and
anoint
him
and
sanctify
him
and
he
will
serve
as
priest
to
me
14
After
that
bring
his
sons
near
and
clothe
them
with
robes
15
You
are
to
anoint
them
just
as
you
anointed
their
father
so
that
they
will
serve
as
priests
to
me
and
their
anointing
will
serve
continually
for
them
as
a
lasting
priesthood
during
their
generations
16
Moses
did
according
to
all
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
He
did
just
so
17
In
the
first
month
in
the
second
year
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
the
tabernacle
was
set
up
18
When
Moses
set
up
the
tabernacle
he
put
its
socket
pedestals
down
set
up
the
panel
frames
put
its
bars
in
and
set
up
its
pillars
19
He
spread
out
the
tent
over
the
tabernacle
and
placed
the
covering
of
the
tent
over
it
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
20
After
that
he
took
the
Testimony
and
put
it
into
the
Ark
and
placed
the
poles
on
the
Ark
and
put
the
cover
on
the
Ark
21
He
brought
the
Ark
into
the
tabernacle
and
put
the
curtain
of
the
screen
in
place
and
screened
off
the
ark
of
the
Testimony
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
22
Next
he
put
the
table
in
the
tent
of
meeting
on
the
north
side
of
the
tabernacle
outside
the
curtain
23
and
he
arranged
the
row
of
bread
on
it
before
Jehovah
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
24
He
placed
the
lampstand
in
the
tent
of
meeting
in
front
of
the
table
on
the
south
side
of
the
tabernacle
25
He
lit
the
lamps
before
Jehovah
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
26
He
next
placed
the
golden
altar
in
the
tent
of
meeting
before
the
curtain
27
in
order
to
make
perfumed
incense
smoke
on
it
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
28
Then
he
put
the
screen
for
the
entrance
of
the
tabernacle
in
place
29
He
placed
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
at
the
entrance
of
the
tabernacle
the
tent
of
meeting
so
that
he
might
offer
up
the
burnt
offering
and
the
grain
offering
on
it
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
30
He
then
placed
the
basin
between
the
tent
of
meeting
and
the
altar
and
put
water
in
it
for
washing
31
Moses
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
washed
their
hands
and
their
feet
at
it
32
Whenever
they
went
into
the
tent
of
meeting
or
approached
the
altar
they
would
wash
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
33
Finally
he
set
up
the
courtyard
around
the
tabernacle
and
the
altar
and
put
up
the
screen
for
the
entrance
of
the
courtyard
So
Moses
finished
the
work
34
And
the
cloud
began
to
cover
the
tent
of
meeting
and
Jehovahs
glory
filled
the
tabernacle
35
Moses
was
not
able
to
go
into
the
tent
of
meeting
because
the
cloud
remained
over
it
and
Jehovahs
glory
filled
the
tabernacle
36
And
when
the
cloud
lifted
from
the
tabernacle
the
Israelites
would
break
camp
during
all
stages
of
their
journey
37
However
if
the
cloud
did
not
lift
up
then
they
would
not
break
camp
until
the
day
it
lifted
38
For
Jehovahs
cloud
was
over
the
tabernacle
by
day
and
a
fire
remained
over
it
by
night
in
the
sight
of
all
the
house
of
Israel
during
all
stages
of
their
journey
1
And
Jehovah
called
Moses
and
spoke
to
him
from
the
tent
of
meeting
saying
2
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
If
any
one
of
you
would
present
an
offering
to
Jehovah
from
the
domestic
animals
you
should
present
your
offering
from
the
herd
or
from
the
flock
3
If
his
offering
is
a
burnt
offering
from
the
herd
he
should
present
a
sound
male
animal
He
should
present
it
of
his
own
free
will
before
Jehovah
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
4
He
is
to
lay
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
burnt
offering
and
it
will
be
accepted
in
his
behalf
to
make
atonement
for
him
5
Then
the
young
bull
must
be
slaughtered
before
Jehovah
and
the
sons
of
Aaron
the
priests
will
present
the
blood
and
sprinkle
the
blood
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
which
is
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
6
The
burnt
offering
should
be
skinned
and
cut
into
pieces
7
The
sons
of
Aaron
the
priests
are
to
put
fire
on
the
altar
and
arrange
wood
on
the
fire
8
The
sons
of
Aaron
the
priests
will
arrange
the
pieces
of
the
offering
with
the
head
and
the
suet
over
the
wood
that
is
on
the
fire
on
the
altar
9
Its
intestines
and
its
shanks
will
be
washed
with
water
and
the
priest
is
to
make
all
of
it
smoke
on
the
altar
as
a
burnt
offering
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
10
If
his
offering
for
a
burnt
offering
is
from
the
flock
from
the
young
rams
or
the
goats
he
should
present
a
sound
male
11
It
is
to
be
slaughtered
at
the
north
side
of
the
altar
before
Jehovah
and
the
sons
of
Aaron
the
priests
will
sprinkle
its
blood
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
12
He
will
cut
it
up
into
pieces
and
with
its
head
and
its
suet
the
priest
will
arrange
them
over
the
wood
on
the
fire
on
the
altar
13
He
will
wash
the
intestines
and
the
shanks
with
water
and
the
priest
will
present
all
of
it
and
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
It
is
a
burnt
offering
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
14
However
if
he
offers
birds
as
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
he
will
present
his
offering
from
the
turtledoves
or
the
young
pigeons
15
The
priest
will
present
it
at
the
altar
and
nip
off
its
head
and
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
but
its
blood
should
be
drained
out
on
the
side
of
the
altar
16
He
should
remove
its
crop
and
its
feathers
and
throw
them
beside
the
altar
to
the
east
to
the
place
for
the
ashes
17
He
will
split
it
at
its
wings
without
dividing
it
into
two
parts
Then
the
priest
will
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
over
the
wood
that
is
on
the
fire
It
is
a
burnt
offering
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
1
Now
if
someone
presents
a
grain
offering
to
Jehovah
his
offering
must
be
fine
flour
and
he
should
pour
oil
on
it
and
put
frankincense
on
it
2
Then
he
will
bring
it
to
the
sons
of
Aaron
the
priests
and
the
priest
will
take
a
handful
of
the
fine
flour
and
oil
and
all
its
frankincense
and
he
will
make
it
smoke
as
a
token
offering
on
the
altar
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
3
Whatever
is
left
of
the
grain
offering
belongs
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
as
something
most
holy
from
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
4
If
you
present
a
grain
offering
that
has
been
baked
in
the
oven
it
should
be
of
fine
flour
unleavened
ring-shaped
loaves
mixed
with
oil
or
unleavened
wafers
spread
with
oil
5
If
your
offering
is
a
grain
offering
from
the
griddle
it
should
be
of
fine
unleavened
flour
mixed
with
oil
6
It
should
be
broken
into
pieces
and
you
are
to
pour
oil
on
it
It
is
a
grain
offering
7
If
your
offering
is
a
grain
offering
prepared
in
a
pan
it
should
be
made
of
fine
flour
with
oil
8
You
should
bring
the
grain
offering
that
was
made
of
these
to
Jehovah
and
it
will
be
presented
to
the
priest
who
will
bring
it
near
to
the
altar
9
And
the
priest
will
lift
off
some
of
the
grain
offering
as
a
token
offering
and
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
10
What
is
left
of
the
grain
offering
belongs
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
as
something
most
holy
of
Jehovahs
offerings
by
fire
11
No
grain
offering
that
you
present
to
Jehovah
should
be
leavened
for
you
must
not
make
any
sourdough
or
honey
smoke
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
12
You
may
present
them
to
Jehovah
as
an
offering
of
the
firstfruits
but
they
must
not
be
brought
to
the
altar
as
a
pleasing
aroma
13
Every
grain
offering
you
make
is
to
be
seasoned
with
salt
and
you
must
not
allow
the
salt
of
the
covenant
of
your
God
to
be
missing
from
your
grain
offering
Along
with
every
offering
of
yours
you
will
present
salt
14
If
you
present
the
grain
offering
of
the
first
ripe
fruits
to
Jehovah
you
should
present
new
grain
roasted
with
fire
coarsely
crushed
new
kernels
as
the
grain
offering
of
your
first
ripe
fruits
15
You
are
to
put
oil
on
it
and
place
frankincense
on
it
It
is
a
grain
offering
16
The
priest
will
make
it
smoke
as
a
token
offering
that
is
some
of
the
coarse
grain
and
oil
along
with
all
its
frankincense
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
1
If
his
offering
is
a
communion
sacrifice
and
if
he
is
presenting
it
from
the
herd
whether
a
male
or
a
female
he
should
present
a
sound
animal
before
Jehovah
2
He
is
to
lay
his
hand
on
the
head
of
his
offering
and
it
will
be
slaughtered
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
Aarons
sons
the
priests
will
sprinkle
the
blood
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
3
He
will
present
part
of
the
communion
sacrifice
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
the
fat
that
covers
the
intestines
all
the
fat
that
surrounds
the
intestines
4
and
the
two
kidneys
with
the
fat
on
them
that
is
near
the
loins
He
will
also
remove
the
appendage
of
the
liver
along
with
the
kidneys
5
Aarons
sons
will
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
on
top
of
the
burnt
offering
that
is
placed
on
the
wood
that
is
over
the
fire
it
is
an
offering
made
by
fire
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
6
If
his
offering
is
from
the
flock
for
a
communion
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
he
will
present
a
sound
male
or
a
female
animal
7
If
he
is
presenting
a
young
ram
as
his
offering
then
he
will
present
it
before
Jehovah
8
He
will
lay
his
hand
on
the
head
of
his
offering
and
it
will
be
slaughtered
in
front
of
the
tent
of
meeting
Aarons
sons
will
sprinkle
its
blood
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
9
He
will
present
the
fat
from
the
communion
sacrifice
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
He
will
remove
the
entire
fat
tail
near
the
backbone
the
fat
that
covers
the
intestines
all
the
fat
that
surrounds
the
intestines
10
and
the
two
kidneys
with
the
fat
on
them
that
is
near
the
loins
He
will
also
remove
the
appendage
of
the
liver
along
with
the
kidneys
11
And
the
priest
will
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
as
food
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
12
If
his
offering
is
a
goat
then
he
will
present
it
before
Jehovah
13
He
will
lay
his
hand
on
its
head
and
it
will
be
slaughtered
before
the
tent
of
meeting
and
Aarons
sons
must
sprinkle
its
blood
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
14
The
part
he
will
present
as
his
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
is
the
fat
that
covers
the
intestines
all
the
fat
that
surrounds
the
intestines
15
and
the
two
kidneys
with
the
fat
on
them
that
is
near
the
loins
He
will
also
remove
the
appendage
of
the
liver
along
with
the
kidneys
16
The
priest
will
make
them
smoke
on
the
altar
as
food
an
offering
made
by
fire
for
a
pleasing
aroma
All
the
fat
belongs
to
Jehovah
17
It
is
a
lasting
statute
for
your
generations
in
all
your
dwelling
places
You
must
not
eat
any
fat
or
any
blood
at
all
1
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
to
Moses
2
Tell
the
Israelites
If
someone
sins
unintentionally
by
doing
any
of
the
things
that
Jehovah
commanded
should
not
be
done
3
If
the
anointed
priest
sins
and
brings
guilt
on
the
people
then
he
must
present
a
sound
young
bull
to
Jehovah
as
a
sin
offering
for
the
sin
he
committed
4
He
will
bring
the
bull
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
before
Jehovah
and
lay
his
hand
on
the
bulls
head
and
he
is
to
slaughter
the
bull
before
Jehovah
5
Then
the
anointed
priest
will
take
some
of
the
bulls
blood
and
bring
it
into
the
tent
of
meeting
6
and
the
priest
will
dip
his
finger
in
the
blood
and
spatter
some
of
the
blood
seven
times
before
Jehovah
in
front
of
the
curtain
of
the
holy
place
7
The
priest
will
also
put
some
of
the
blood
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
of
perfumed
incense
which
is
before
Jehovah
in
the
tent
of
meeting
and
he
will
pour
all
the
rest
of
the
bulls
blood
at
the
base
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
which
is
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
8
He
will
then
remove
all
the
fat
of
the
bull
of
the
sin
offering
including
the
fat
that
covers
the
intestines
and
the
fat
that
surrounds
the
intestines
9
and
the
two
kidneys
with
the
fat
on
them
that
is
near
the
loins
And
he
will
remove
the
appendage
of
the
liver
along
with
the
kidneys
10
It
will
be
the
same
as
what
is
removed
from
a
bull
of
the
communion
sacrifice
And
the
priest
will
make
them
smoke
on
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
11
But
as
for
the
skin
of
the
bull
and
all
its
flesh
along
with
its
head
its
shanks
its
intestines
and
its
dung—
12
all
the
rest
of
the
bull—he
will
have
it
taken
to
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
to
a
clean
place
where
the
ashes
are
discarded
and
he
will
burn
it
on
wood
in
the
fire
It
should
be
burned
where
the
ashes
are
discarded
13
Now
if
the
entire
assembly
of
Israel
has
become
guilty
by
committing
a
sin
unintentionally
but
the
congregation
was
unaware
that
they
had
done
something
that
Jehovah
commanded
them
not
to
do
14
and
then
the
sin
becomes
known
the
congregation
must
present
a
young
bull
for
a
sin
offering
and
bring
it
before
the
tent
of
meeting
15
The
elders
of
the
assembly
will
lay
their
hands
on
the
bulls
head
before
Jehovah
and
the
bull
will
be
slaughtered
before
Jehovah
16
Then
the
anointed
priest
will
bring
some
of
the
bulls
blood
into
the
tent
of
meeting
17
The
priest
is
to
dip
his
finger
into
the
blood
and
spatter
some
of
it
seven
times
before
Jehovah
in
front
of
the
curtain
18
He
will
then
put
some
of
the
blood
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
that
is
before
Jehovah
which
is
in
the
tent
of
meeting
and
he
will
pour
all
the
rest
of
the
blood
at
the
base
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
which
is
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
19
He
will
remove
all
its
fat
and
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
20
He
is
to
do
to
the
bull
just
as
he
did
to
the
other
bull
of
the
sin
offering
That
is
how
he
will
do
it
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
them
and
they
will
be
forgiven
21
He
will
have
the
bull
taken
to
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
and
will
burn
it
just
as
he
burned
the
first
bull
It
is
a
sin
offering
for
the
congregation
22
When
a
chieftain
unintentionally
sins
by
doing
one
of
all
the
things
that
Jehovah
his
God
commands
should
not
be
done
and
has
become
guilty
23
or
if
he
becomes
aware
of
a
sin
that
he
has
committed
against
the
commandment
then
he
must
bring
a
sound
young
male
goat
as
his
offering
24
He
will
lay
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
young
goat
and
slaughter
it
in
the
place
where
the
burnt
offering
is
slaughtered
before
Jehovah
It
is
a
sin
offering
25
The
priest
will
take
some
of
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering
with
his
finger
and
put
it
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
and
he
will
pour
the
rest
of
its
blood
at
the
base
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
26
He
will
make
all
its
fat
smoke
on
the
altar
like
the
fat
of
the
communion
sacrifice
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
for
his
sin
and
it
will
be
forgiven
him
27
If
any
one
of
the
people
of
the
land
sins
unintentionally
and
becomes
guilty
by
doing
one
of
the
things
that
Jehovah
commands
should
not
be
done
28
or
if
he
becomes
aware
of
a
sin
that
he
has
committed
then
he
should
bring
a
sound
young
female
goat
as
his
offering
for
the
sin
he
has
committed
29
He
will
lay
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
sin
offering
and
slaughter
the
sin
offering
in
the
same
place
as
the
burnt
offering
30
The
priest
will
take
some
of
its
blood
with
his
finger
and
put
it
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
and
he
will
pour
all
the
rest
of
its
blood
at
the
base
of
the
altar
31
He
will
remove
all
its
fat
just
as
the
fat
is
removed
from
the
communion
sacrifice
and
the
priest
will
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
and
it
will
be
forgiven
him
32
But
if
he
offers
a
lamb
as
his
sin
offering
he
should
bring
a
sound
female
lamb
33
He
will
lay
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
sin
offering
and
slaughter
it
as
a
sin
offering
in
the
place
where
the
burnt
offering
is
slaughtered
34
The
priest
will
take
some
of
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering
with
his
finger
and
put
it
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
and
he
will
pour
all
the
rest
of
its
blood
at
the
base
of
the
altar
35
He
will
remove
all
its
fat
the
same
way
that
the
fat
of
the
young
ram
of
the
communion
sacrifice
is
removed
and
the
priest
will
make
them
smoke
on
the
altar
on
top
of
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
for
the
sin
that
he
has
committed
and
it
will
be
forgiven
him
1
If
someone
sins
because
he
has
heard
a
public
call
to
testify
and
he
is
a
witness
or
has
seen
or
learned
about
it
and
he
does
not
report
it
then
he
will
answer
for
his
error
2
Or
when
a
person
touches
anything
unclean
whether
the
dead
body
of
an
unclean
wild
animal
an
unclean
domestic
animal
or
an
unclean
swarming
creature
he
is
unclean
and
has
become
guilty
even
if
he
does
not
realize
it
3
Or
in
case
someone
without
being
aware
of
it
touches
human
uncleanness—anything
unclean
that
may
make
him
unclean—and
he
comes
to
know
it
then
he
becomes
guilty
4
Or
if
someone
rashly
swears
to
do
something—whether
it
is
to
do
good
or
to
do
evil
no
matter
what
it
may
be—and
he
was
unaware
of
it
but
then
he
realizes
that
he
has
sworn
rashly
he
becomes
guilty
5
If
he
becomes
guilty
as
respects
one
of
these
things
then
he
must
confess
in
what
way
he
has
sinned
6
He
will
also
bring
his
guilt
offering
to
Jehovah
for
the
sin
that
he
committed
namely
a
female
from
the
flock
either
a
female
lamb
or
a
young
female
goat
for
a
sin
offering
Then
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
for
his
sin
7
If
though
he
cannot
afford
a
sheep
he
must
bring
to
Jehovah
two
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
as
his
guilt
offering
for
the
sin
one
for
a
sin
offering
and
one
for
a
burnt
offering
8
He
is
to
bring
them
to
the
priest
who
will
present
first
the
one
for
the
sin
offering
and
nip
off
its
head
at
the
front
of
its
neck
without
severing
it
9
He
will
spatter
some
of
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering
on
the
side
of
the
altar
but
the
remainder
of
the
blood
will
be
drained
out
at
the
base
of
the
altar
It
is
a
sin
offering
10
He
will
handle
the
other
one
as
a
burnt
offering
according
to
the
regular
procedure
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
for
the
sin
that
he
has
committed
and
it
will
be
forgiven
him
11
Now
if
he
cannot
afford
two
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
he
must
bring
as
his
offering
for
his
sin
a
tenth
of
an
ephah
of
fine
flour
for
a
sin
offering
He
should
not
add
oil
to
it
or
place
frankincense
on
it
for
it
is
a
sin
offering
12
He
will
bring
it
to
the
priest
and
the
priest
will
take
from
it
his
handful
as
a
token
offering
and
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
on
top
of
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
It
is
a
sin
offering
13
The
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
for
the
sin
that
he
has
committed
any
one
of
these
sins
and
it
will
be
forgiven
him
The
remainder
of
the
offering
will
become
the
priests
just
like
the
grain
offering
14
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
15
If
someone
behaves
unfaithfully
by
unintentionally
sinning
against
the
holy
things
of
Jehovah
he
is
to
bring
to
Jehovah
a
sound
ram
from
the
flock
as
a
guilt
offering
its
value
in
silver
shekels
is
set
according
to
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
16
And
he
will
make
compensation
for
the
sin
he
has
committed
against
the
holy
place
and
he
will
also
add
a
fifth
of
its
value
He
will
give
it
to
the
priest
so
that
the
priest
may
make
atonement
for
him
with
the
ram
of
the
guilt
offering
and
it
will
be
forgiven
him
17
If
someone
sins
by
doing
any
of
the
things
that
Jehovah
commands
should
not
be
done
even
if
he
is
not
aware
of
it
he
is
still
guilty
and
will
answer
for
his
error
18
He
should
bring
to
the
priest
a
sound
ram
from
the
flock
according
to
the
estimated
value
for
a
guilt
offering
Then
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
for
the
unintentional
mistake
that
he
unknowingly
committed
and
it
will
be
forgiven
him
19
It
is
a
guilt
offering
He
has
certainly
become
guilty
of
sinning
against
Jehovah

went
on
to
say
to
Moses
2
If
someone
sins
and
behaves
unfaithfully
toward
Jehovah
by
deceiving
his
neighbor
in
connection
with
something
entrusted
to
him
or
something
deposited
with
him
or
he
robs
or
defrauds
his
neighbor
3
or
he
finds
something
lost
and
is
deceptive
about
it
and
if
he
swears
falsely
over
any
such
sin
he
may
commit
this
is
what
he
should
do
4
If
he
has
sinned
and
is
guilty
he
must
return
what
he
stole
what
he
extorted
what
he
took
by
fraud
what
was
entrusted
to
him
or
the
lost
thing
that
he
found
5
or
anything
about
which
he
swore
falsely
and
he
must
make
full
compensation
for
it
and
he
will
add
to
it
a
fifth
of
its
value
He
will
give
it
to
the
owner
on
the
day
his
guilt
is
proved
6
And
he
will
bring
to
the
priest
as
his
guilt
offering
to
Jehovah
a
sound
ram
from
the
flock
according
to
the
assessed
value
for
a
guilt
offering
7
The
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
before
Jehovah
and
he
will
be
forgiven
for
anything
he
may
have
done
resulting
in
his
guilt
8
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
9
Command
Aaron
and
his
sons
and
say
This
is
the
law
of
the
burnt
offering
The
burnt
offering
will
remain
on
the
hearth
on
the
altar
all
night
long
until
the
morning
and
the
fire
will
be
kept
burning
on
the
altar
10
The
priest
will
clothe
himself
with
his
official
dress
of
linen
and
he
will
put
the
linen
shorts
on
over
his
flesh
Then
he
will
remove
the
ashes
of
the
burnt
offering
that
the
fire
had
consumed
on
the
altar
and
place
them
beside
the
altar
11
Then
he
will
take
off
his
garments
and
put
on
other
garments
and
take
the
ashes
to
a
clean
place
outside
the
camp
12
The
fire
will
be
kept
burning
on
the
altar
It
must
not
go
out
The
priest
must
burn
wood
on
it
each
morning
and
arrange
the
burnt
offering
over
it
and
he
will
make
the
fat
of
the
communion
sacrifices
smoke
over
it
13
Fire
will
be
kept
constantly
burning
on
the
altar
It
must
not
go
out
14
Now
this
is
the
law
of
the
grain
offering
You
sons
of
Aaron
are
to
present
it
before
Jehovah
in
front
of
the
altar
15
One
of
them
will
take
a
handful
from
the
fine
flour
of
the
grain
offering
and
some
of
its
oil
and
all
the
frankincense
that
is
on
the
grain
offering
and
he
will
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
as
a
pleasing
aroma
for
a
token
offering
to
Jehovah
16
Aaron
and
his
sons
will
eat
what
is
left
of
it
It
will
be
eaten
as
unleavened
bread
in
a
holy
place
They
will
eat
it
in
the
courtyard
of
the
tent
of
meeting
17
It
should
not
be
baked
with
anything
leavened
I
have
given
it
as
their
share
out
of
my
offerings
made
by
fire
It
is
something
most
holy
like
the
sin
offering
and
like
the
guilt
offering
18
Every
male
among
the
sons
of
Aaron
will
eat
it
It
is
their
permanent
allowance
throughout
your
generations
from
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
Everything
that
touches
them
will
become
holy
19
Jehovah
spoke
again
to
Moses
20
This
is
the
offering
that
Aaron
and
his
sons
will
present
to
Jehovah
on
the
day
he
is
anointed
the
tenth
of
an
ephah
of
fine
flour
as
a
regular
grain
offering
half
of
it
in
the
morning
and
half
of
it
in
the
evening
21
It
will
be
made
with
oil
on
a
griddle
You
will
bring
it
well-mixed
with
oil
and
present
it
in
pieces
as
a
baked
product
of
the
grain
offering
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
22
The
anointed
priest
who
succeeds
him
from
among
his
sons
will
make
it
It
is
a
lasting
regulation
As
a
whole
offering
it
will
be
made
to
smoke
to
Jehovah
23
Every
grain
offering
of
a
priest
should
be
a
whole
offering
It
must
not
be
eaten
24
Jehovah
spoke
again
to
Moses
and
said
25
Tell
Aaron
and
his
sons
This
is
the
law
of
the
sin
offering
In
the
place
where
the
burnt
offering
is
slaughtered
the
sin
offering
will
also
be
slaughtered
before
Jehovah
It
is
a
most
holy
thing
26
The
priest
who
offers
it
for
sin
will
eat
it
It
will
be
eaten
in
a
holy
place
in
the
courtyard
of
the
tent
of
meeting
27
Everything
that
touches
its
flesh
will
become
holy
and
when
anyone
spatters
some
of
its
blood
on
his
garment
you
should
wash
what
was
spattered
with
blood
in
a
holy
place
28
The
earthenware
vessel
in
which
it
was
boiled
is
to
be
shattered
But
if
it
was
boiled
in
a
copper
vessel
then
the
vessel
must
be
scoured
and
washed
with
water
29
Every
male
among
the
priests
will
eat
it
It
is
something
most
holy
30
However
no
sin
offering
is
to
be
eaten
if
some
of
its
blood
is
brought
into
the
tent
of
meeting
to
make
atonement
in
the
holy
place
It
is
to
be
burned
with
fire
1
This
is
the
law
of
the
guilt
offering
It
is
something
most
holy
2
They
will
slaughter
the
guilt
offering
in
the
place
where
they
slaughter
the
burnt
offerings
and
its
blood
should
be
sprinkled
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
3
He
will
present
all
its
fat
including
the
fat
tail
the
fat
that
covers
the
intestines
4
and
the
two
kidneys
with
their
fat
that
is
near
the
loins
He
will
also
remove
the
appendage
of
the
liver
along
with
the
kidneys
5
The
priest
will
make
them
smoke
on
the
altar
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
It
is
a
guilt
offering
6
Every
male
among
the
priests
will
eat
it
and
it
should
be
eaten
in
a
holy
place
It
is
something
most
holy
7
The
law
regarding
the
sin
offering
applies
to
the
guilt
offering
it
belongs
to
the
priest
who
makes
atonement
with
it
8
When
the
priest
presents
the
burnt
offering
for
someone
the
skin
of
the
burnt
offering
that
was
presented
to
the
priest
will
become
his
9
Every
grain
offering
that
is
baked
in
the
oven
or
prepared
in
the
pan
or
on
the
griddle
belongs
to
the
priest
who
presents
it
It
will
become
his
10
But
every
grain
offering
that
is
mixed
with
oil
or
that
is
dry
will
be
for
all
of
Aarons
sons
each
will
have
an
equal
share
11
Now
this
is
the
law
of
the
communion
sacrifice
that
one
may
present
to
Jehovah
12
If
he
presents
it
as
an
expression
of
thanksgiving
he
will
present
along
with
the
thanksgiving
sacrifice
unleavened
ring-shaped
loaves
mixed
with
oil
unleavened
wafers
spread
with
oil
and
ring-shaped
loaves
made
with
fine
flour
well-mixed
and
blended
with
oil
13
He
will
present
his
offering
along
with
ring-shaped
loaves
of
leavened
bread
and
the
thanksgiving
sacrifice
of
his
communion
sacrifices
14
He
is
to
present
from
it
one
of
each
offering
as
a
sacred
portion
to
Jehovah
it
will
belong
to
the
priest
who
sprinkles
the
blood
of
the
communion
sacrifices
15
The
flesh
of
the
thanksgiving
sacrifice
of
his
communion
sacrifices
is
to
be
eaten
on
the
day
he
offers
it
He
must
not
save
any
of
it
until
morning
16
If
the
sacrifice
of
his
offering
is
a
vow
or
a
voluntary
offering
it
is
to
be
eaten
on
the
day
he
presents
his
sacrifice
and
what
is
left
of
it
may
also
be
eaten
on
the
next
day
17
But
whatever
is
left
of
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
on
the
third
day
is
to
be
burned
with
fire
18
However
if
any
of
the
flesh
of
his
communion
sacrifice
is
eaten
on
the
third
day
the
one
presenting
it
will
not
be
accepted
with
approval
It
will
not
be
credited
to
him
it
is
an
offensive
thing
and
the
person
who
eats
some
of
it
will
answer
for
his
error
19
Flesh
that
touches
anything
unclean
is
not
to
be
eaten
It
is
to
be
burned
with
fire
Everyone
who
is
clean
may
eat
the
clean
flesh
20
But
any
person
who
is
unclean
and
eats
the
flesh
of
the
communion
sacrifice
which
is
for
Jehovah
that
person
must
be
cut
off
from
his
people
21
If
someone
touches
anything
unclean
whether
the
uncleanness
of
a
man
or
an
unclean
animal
or
any
unclean
disgusting
thing
and
eats
some
of
the
flesh
of
the
communion
sacrifice
which
is
for
Jehovah
that
person
must
be
cut
off
from
his
people
22
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
23
Tell
the
Israelites
You
must
not
eat
any
fat
of
a
bull
or
a
young
ram
or
a
goat
24
The
fat
of
an
animal
found
dead
and
the
fat
of
an
animal
killed
by
another
animal
may
be
used
for
any
other
purpose
but
you
must
never
eat
it
25
For
whoever
eats
fat
from
an
animal
that
he
presents
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
must
be
cut
off
from
his
people
26
You
must
not
eat
any
blood
in
any
of
your
dwelling
places
whether
that
of
birds
or
that
of
animals
27
Anyone
who
eats
any
blood
must
be
cut
off
from
his
people
28
Jehovah
went
on
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
29
Tell
the
Israelites
Whoever
presents
his
communion
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
will
bring
part
of
the
offering
from
his
communion
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
30
He
will
bring
in
his
own
hands
the
fat
along
with
the
breast
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
and
he
will
wave
it
back
and
forth
as
a
wave
offering
before
Jehovah
31
The
priest
will
make
the
fat
smoke
on
the
altar
but
the
breast
will
belong
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
32
You
will
give
the
right
leg
as
a
sacred
portion
to
the
priest
from
your
communion
sacrifices
33
The
son
of
Aaron
who
presents
the
blood
of
the
communion
sacrifices
and
the
fat
will
have
the
right
leg
as
his
portion
34
For
I
take
the
breast
of
the
wave
offering
and
the
leg
of
the
sacred
portion
from
the
communion
sacrifices
of
the
Israelites
and
I
give
them
to
Aaron
the
priest
and
his
sons
as
a
lasting
regulation
for
the
Israelites
35
This
was
the
portion
from
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
to
be
set
aside
for
the
priests
for
Aaron
and
his
sons
on
the
day
he
presented
them
to
serve
as
priests
to
Jehovah
36
Jehovah
commanded
to
give
them
this
portion
from
the
Israelites
on
the
day
he
anointed
them
It
is
a
permanent
statute
for
their
generations
37
This
is
the
law
concerning
the
burnt
offering
the
grain
offering
the
sin
offering
the
guilt
offering
the
installation
sacrifice
and
the
communion
sacrifice
38
just
as
Jehovah
commanded
Moses
on
Mount
Sinai
in
the
day
he
commanded
the
Israelites
to
present
their
offerings
to
Jehovah
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
1
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
2
Take
Aaron
and
his
sons
with
him
the
garments
the
anointing
oil
the
bull
of
the
sin
offering
the
two
rams
and
the
basket
of
unleavened
bread
3
and
make
all
the
assembly
gather
together
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
4
Then
Moses
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
and
the
assembly
gathered
together
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
5
Moses
now
said
to
the
assembly
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
commanded
us
to
do
6
So
Moses
brought
Aaron
and
his
sons
near
and
washed
them
with
water
7
After
that
he
put
the
robe
on
him
wrapped
him
with
the
sash
clothed
him
with
the
sleeveless
coat
and
put
the
ephod
on
him
and
tied
it
with
the
woven
belt
of
the
ephod
binding
it
securely
on
him
8
Next
he
placed
the
breastpiece
on
him
and
put
the
Urim
and
the
Thummim
in
the
breastpiece
9
Then
he
placed
the
turban
on
his
head
and
he
put
on
the
front
of
the
turban
the
shining
plate
of
gold
the
holy
sign
of
dedication
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
10
Moses
then
took
the
anointing
oil
and
anointed
the
tabernacle
and
all
that
was
in
it
and
sanctified
them
11
After
that
he
spattered
some
of
it
seven
times
on
the
altar
and
anointed
the
altar
and
all
its
utensils
and
the
basin
and
its
stand
in
order
to
sanctify
them
12
Finally
he
poured
some
of
the
anointing
oil
on
Aarons
head
and
anointed
him
in
order
to
sanctify
him
13
Moses
then
brought
Aarons
sons
near
and
clothed
them
with
robes
and
wrapped
them
with
sashes
and
put
headgear
on
them
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
14
Then
he
brought
the
bull
of
the
sin
offering
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
laid
their
hands
on
the
head
of
the
bull
of
the
sin
offering
15
Moses
slaughtered
it
and
took
the
blood
with
his
finger
and
put
it
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
on
all
sides
and
he
purified
the
altar
from
sin
but
the
rest
of
the
blood
he
poured
at
the
base
of
the
altar
in
order
to
sanctify
it
to
make
atonement
on
it
16
After
that
he
took
all
the
fat
that
was
on
the
intestines
the
appendage
of
the
liver
and
the
two
kidneys
and
their
fat
and
Moses
made
them
smoke
on
the
altar
17
Then
he
had
the
rest
of
the
bull
its
skin
its
flesh
and
its
dung
burned
with
fire
outside
the
camp
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
18
He
now
brought
the
ram
of
the
burnt
offering
near
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
laid
their
hands
on
the
head
of
the
ram
19
Moses
then
slaughtered
it
and
sprinkled
the
blood
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
20
He
cut
the
ram
into
its
pieces
and
Moses
made
the
head
the
pieces
and
the
suet
smoke
21
He
washed
the
intestines
and
the
shanks
with
water
and
Moses
made
the
entire
ram
smoke
on
the
altar
It
was
a
burnt
offering
as
a
pleasing
aroma
It
was
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
22
Then
he
brought
the
second
ram
the
ram
of
the
installation
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
laid
their
hands
on
the
rams
head
23
Moses
slaughtered
it
and
took
some
of
its
blood
and
put
it
on
Aarons
right
earlobe
and
on
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
and
on
the
big
toe
of
his
right
foot
24
Next
Moses
brought
Aarons
sons
forward
and
put
some
of
the
blood
on
their
right
earlobe
and
on
the
thumb
of
their
right
hand
and
on
the
big
toe
of
their
right
foot
but
Moses
sprinkled
the
rest
of
the
blood
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
25
Then
he
took
the
fat
the
fat
tail
all
the
fat
that
was
on
the
intestines
the
appendage
of
the
liver
the
two
kidneys
and
their
fat
and
the
right
leg
26
He
took
out
of
the
basket
of
unleavened
bread
that
was
before
Jehovah
one
unleavened
ring-shaped
loaf
one
ring-shaped
loaf
of
oiled
bread
and
one
wafer
He
then
placed
them
on
the
pieces
of
fat
and
the
right
leg
27
After
that
he
put
all
of
them
on
the
palms
of
Aaron
and
the
palms
of
his
sons
and
began
to
wave
them
back
and
forth
as
a
wave
offering
before
Jehovah
28
Then
Moses
took
them
from
their
hands
and
made
them
smoke
on
the
altar
on
top
of
the
burnt
offering
They
were
an
installation
sacrifice
as
a
pleasing
aroma
It
was
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
29
Moses
then
took
the
breast
and
waved
it
back
and
forth
as
a
wave
offering
before
Jehovah
From
the
installation
ram
it
became
the
portion
for
Moses
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
30
And
Moses
took
some
of
the
anointing
oil
and
some
of
the
blood
that
was
on
the
altar
and
spattered
it
on
Aaron
and
his
garments
and
on
his
sons
and
the
garments
of
his
sons
who
were
with
him
Thus
he
sanctified
Aaron
and
his
garments
and
his
sons
and
their
garments
31
Then
Moses
said
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
Boil
the
flesh
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
you
will
eat
it
there
with
the
bread
that
is
in
the
installation
basket
just
as
I
was
commanded
Aaron
and
his
sons
will
eat
it
32
What
is
left
over
of
the
flesh
and
the
bread
you
will
burn
with
fire
33
You
must
not
go
out
from
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
for
seven
days
until
the
days
for
completing
your
installation
are
over
because
it
will
take
seven
days
to
install
you
as
priests
34
Jehovah
commanded
that
we
do
what
we
have
done
today
in
order
to
make
atonement
for
you
35
You
will
stay
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
day
and
night
for
seven
days
and
carry
out
your
obligation
to
Jehovah
so
that
you
may
not
die
for
so
I
have
been
commanded
36
And
Aaron
and
his
sons
did
all
the
things
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
by
means
of
Moses
1
On
the
eighth
day
Moses
called
Aaron
and
his
sons
and
the
elders
of
Israel
2
He
said
to
Aaron
Take
for
yourself
a
young
calf
for
a
sin
offering
and
a
ram
for
a
burnt
offering
sound
ones
and
present
them
before
Jehovah
3
But
you
will
say
to
the
Israelites
Take
a
male
goat
for
a
sin
offering
and
a
calf
and
a
young
ram
each
a
year
old
sound
ones
for
a
burnt
offering
4
and
a
bull
and
a
ram
for
communion
sacrifices
to
sacrifice
them
before
Jehovah
and
a
grain
offering
mixed
with
oil
for
today
Jehovah
will
appear
to
you
5
So
they
took
what
Moses
had
commanded
before
the
tent
of
meeting
Then
the
whole
assembly
came
forward
and
stood
before
Jehovah
6
And
Moses
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
commanded
you
to
do
so
that
the
glory
of
Jehovah
may
appear
to
you
7
Then
Moses
said
to
Aaron
Approach
the
altar
and
present
your
sin
offering
and
your
burnt
offering
and
make
atonement
in
your
own
behalf
and
in
behalf
of
your
house
and
present
the
offering
of
the
people
and
make
atonement
in
their
behalf
just
as
Jehovah
has
commanded
8
Aaron
immediately
approached
the
altar
and
slaughtered
the
calf
of
the
sin
offering
that
was
for
him
9
Then
Aarons
sons
presented
the
blood
to
him
and
he
dipped
his
finger
in
the
blood
and
put
it
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
and
he
poured
the
rest
of
the
blood
at
the
base
of
the
altar
10
He
made
the
fat
and
the
kidneys
and
the
appendage
of
the
liver
from
the
sin
offering
smoke
on
the
altar
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
11
And
he
burned
the
flesh
and
the
skin
with
fire
outside
the
camp
12
Then
he
slaughtered
the
burnt
offering
and
Aarons
sons
handed
him
the
blood
and
he
sprinkled
it
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
13
They
handed
him
the
pieces
of
the
burnt
offering
along
with
the
head
and
he
made
them
smoke
on
the
altar
14
Further
he
washed
the
intestines
and
the
shanks
and
made
them
smoke
on
the
burnt
offering
on
the
altar
15
He
then
presented
the
offering
of
the
people
and
took
the
goat
of
the
sin
offering
that
was
for
the
people
and
slaughtered
it
and
made
a
sin
offering
with
it
like
the
first
one
16
And
he
presented
the
burnt
offering
and
handled
it
according
to
the
regular
procedure
17
He
next
presented
the
grain
offering
filling
his
hand
with
some
of
it
and
making
it
smoke
on
the
altar
in
addition
to
the
burnt
offering
of
the
morning
18
After
that
he
slaughtered
the
bull
and
the
ram
of
the
communion
sacrifice
that
was
for
the
people
Then
Aarons
sons
handed
him
the
blood
and
he
sprinkled
it
around
on
all
sides
of
the
altar
19
As
for
the
pieces
of
fat
of
the
bull
the
fat
tail
of
the
ram
the
fat
covering
the
internal
organs
the
kidneys
and
the
appendage
of
the
liver
20
they
placed
all
those
pieces
of
fat
on
the
breasts
after
which
he
made
the
pieces
of
fat
smoke
on
the
altar
21
But
the
breasts
and
the
right
leg
Aaron
waved
back
and
forth
as
a
wave
offering
before
Jehovah
just
as
Moses
had
commanded
22
Then
Aaron
raised
his
hands
toward
the
people
and
blessed
them
and
came
down
from
making
the
sin
offering
and
the
burnt
offering
and
the
communion
sacrifices
23
Finally
Moses
and
Aaron
went
into
the
tent
of
meeting
and
came
out
and
blessed
the
people
Jehovahs
glory
now
appeared
to
all
the
people
24
and
fire
came
out
from
Jehovah
and
began
consuming
the
burnt
offering
and
the
pieces
of
fat
on
the
altar
When
all
the
people
saw
it
they
started
shouting
and
they
fell
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
1
Later
Aarons
sons
Nadab
and
Abihu
each
took
his
fire
holder
and
put
fire
in
it
and
placed
incense
on
it
Then
they
began
offering
before
Jehovah
unauthorized
fire
which
he
had
not
commanded
them
to
do
2
At
this
a
fire
came
out
from
before
Jehovah
and
consumed
them
so
that
they
died
before
Jehovah
3
Then
Moses
said
to
Aaron
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
said
I
will
be
made
holy
among
those
near
to
me
and
I
will
be
glorified
before
all
the
people
And
Aaron
kept
silent
4
So
Moses
called
Mishael
and
Elzaphan
the
sons
of
Uzziel
Aarons
uncle
and
said
to
them
Come
here
carry
your
brothers
from
in
front
of
the
holy
place
to
a
place
outside
the
camp
5
So
they
came
forward
and
carried
the
men
away
in
their
robes
to
a
place
outside
the
camp
just
as
Moses
had
told
them
6
Moses
then
said
to
Aaron
and
his
other
sons
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
Do
not
let
your
heads
go
ungroomed
or
tear
your
garments
so
that
you
may
not
die
and
that
God
may
not
become
indignant
against
all
the
assembly
Your
brothers
of
the
whole
house
of
Israel
will
weep
over
those
whom
Jehovah
has
killed
by
the
fire
7
You
must
not
go
out
from
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
or
you
will
die
for
Jehovahs
anointing
oil
is
upon
you
So
they
did
according
to
Moses
word
8
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Aaron
9
Do
not
drink
wine
or
other
alcoholic
beverages
you
and
your
sons
with
you
when
you
come
into
the
tent
of
meeting
so
that
you
will
not
die
It
is
a
permanent
statute
for
your
generations
10
This
is
to
distinguish
between
the
holy
thing
and
the
profane
and
between
the
unclean
thing
and
the
clean
11
and
to
teach
the
Israelites
all
the
regulations
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
to
them
through
Moses
12
Then
Moses
spoke
to
Aaron
and
to
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
his
sons
who
were
left
Take
what
was
left
of
the
grain
offering
from
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
and
eat
it
as
unleavened
bread
near
the
altar
because
it
is
something
most
holy
13
You
must
eat
it
in
a
holy
place
because
it
is
your
allowance
and
the
allowance
of
your
sons
from
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
for
this
is
what
I
have
been
commanded
14
You
will
also
eat
the
breast
of
the
wave
offering
and
the
leg
of
the
sacred
portion
in
a
clean
place
you
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
with
you
because
these
things
have
been
given
as
your
allowance
and
the
allowance
of
your
sons
from
the
communion
sacrifices
of
the
Israelites
15
They
will
bring
the
leg
of
the
sacred
portion
and
the
breast
of
the
wave
offering
along
with
the
offerings
of
fat
made
by
fire
in
order
to
wave
the
wave
offering
back
and
forth
before
Jehovah
and
it
will
serve
as
a
permanent
allowance
for
you
and
your
sons
with
you
just
as
Jehovah
has
commanded
16
And
Moses
diligently
searched
for
the
goat
of
the
sin
offering
and
he
discovered
that
it
had
been
burned
up
So
he
grew
indignant
at
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
Aarons
sons
who
were
left
and
he
said
17
Why
did
you
not
eat
the
sin
offering
in
the
holy
place
since
it
is
something
most
holy
and
he
has
given
it
to
you
so
that
you
may
answer
for
the
error
of
the
assembly
and
make
atonement
for
them
before
Jehovah
18
Look
Its
blood
has
not
been
brought
inside
the
holy
place
You
certainly
should
have
eaten
it
in
the
holy
place
just
as
I
was
commanded
19
Aaron
replied
to
Moses
Look
Today
they
presented
their
sin
offering
and
their
burnt
offering
before
Jehovah
and
yet
these
things
happened
to
me
If
I
had
eaten
the
sin
offering
today
would
that
have
been
pleasing
to
Jehovah
20
When
Moses
heard
that
he
was
satisfied
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
2
Tell
the
Israelites
These
are
the
living
creatures
of
the
earth
that
you
may
eat
3
Every
animal
that
has
a
split
hoof
and
a
cleft
in
its
hooves
and
that
chews
the
cud
may
be
eaten
4
But
you
must
not
eat
these
animals
that
chew
the
cud
or
have
a
split
hoof
the
camel
which
chews
the
cud
but
does
not
have
a
split
hoof
It
is
unclean
for
you
5
Also
the
rock
badger
because
it
chews
the
cud
but
does
not
have
a
split
hoof
It
is
unclean
for
you
6
Also
the
hare
because
it
chews
the
cud
but
does
not
have
a
split
hoof
It
is
unclean
for
you
7
Also
the
pig
because
it
has
a
split
hoof
and
a
cleft
in
the
hoof
but
does
not
chew
the
cud
It
is
unclean
for
you
8
You
must
not
eat
any
of
their
flesh
or
touch
their
dead
body
They
are
unclean
for
you
9
This
is
what
you
may
eat
of
everything
in
the
waters
Anything
in
the
waters
that
has
fins
and
scales
whether
in
the
seas
or
in
the
rivers
it
you
may
eat
10
But
anything
in
the
seas
and
in
the
rivers
that
has
no
fins
and
scales
among
all
the
swarming
creatures
and
of
every
other
living
creature
that
is
in
the
waters
it
is
a
loathsome
thing
for
you
11
Yes
they
should
be
loathsome
to
you
and
you
must
not
eat
any
of
their
flesh
and
you
must
loathe
their
carcasses
12
Everything
in
the
waters
that
has
no
fins
and
scales
is
a
loathsome
thing
to
you
13
These
are
the
flying
creatures
that
you
are
to
loathe
they
should
not
be
eaten
for
they
are
loathsome
the
eagle
the
osprey
the
black
vulture
14
the
red
kite
and
every
kind
of
black
kite
15
every
kind
of
raven
16
the
ostrich
the
owl
the
gull
every
kind
of
falcon
17
the
little
owl
the
cormorant
the
long-eared
owl
18
the
swan
the
pelican
the
vulture
19
the
stork
every
kind
of
heron
the
hoopoe
and
the
bat
20
Every
winged
swarming
creature
that
goes
on
all
fours
is
something
loathsome
to
you
21
Of
the
winged
swarming
creatures
that
move
on
all
fours
you
may
eat
only
those
that
have
jointed
legs
above
their
feet
for
leaping
on
the
ground
22
Of
these
you
may
eat
various
kinds
of
migratory
locusts
other
edible
locusts
crickets
and
grasshoppers
23
All
other
winged
swarming
creatures
with
four
legs
are
something
loathsome
to
you
24
By
these
you
would
make
yourselves
unclean
Everyone
touching
their
dead
bodies
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
25
Anyone
carrying
any
of
their
dead
bodies
should
wash
his
garments
he
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
26
Any
animal
that
has
a
split
hoof
but
does
not
have
a
cleft
and
does
not
chew
its
cud
is
unclean
to
you
Everyone
touching
them
will
be
unclean
27
Every
living
creature
that
walks
on
paws
among
the
creatures
that
walk
on
all
fours
is
unclean
to
you
Everyone
touching
their
dead
bodies
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
28
The
one
who
carries
their
dead
bodies
should
wash
his
garments
and
he
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
They
are
unclean
to
you
29
These
are
the
swarming
creatures
of
the
earth
that
are
unclean
to
you
the
mole
rat
the
mouse
every
kind
of
lizard
30
the
gecko
the
large
lizard
the
newt
the
sand
lizard
and
the
chameleon
31
These
swarming
creatures
are
unclean
to
you
Everyone
touching
their
dead
bodies
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
32
Now
anything
they
fall
on
when
they
die
will
be
unclean
whether
a
wooden
utensil
a
garment
a
skin
or
a
piece
of
sackcloth
Any
utensil
that
is
used
should
be
immersed
in
water
and
it
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
then
it
will
be
clean
33
If
they
fall
into
an
earthenware
vessel
you
are
to
smash
it
and
anything
that
was
in
it
will
be
unclean
34
Any
kind
of
food
that
comes
in
contact
with
water
from
such
a
vessel
will
be
unclean
and
any
drinkable
liquid
in
such
a
vessel
will
be
unclean
35
Anything
their
dead
bodies
fall
on
will
be
unclean
Whether
oven
or
small
stove
it
should
be
broken
into
pieces
They
are
unclean
and
they
will
remain
unclean
to
you
36
Only
a
spring
and
a
cistern
for
storing
water
will
continue
clean
but
anyone
touching
their
dead
bodies
will
be
unclean
37
If
their
dead
bodies
fall
on
a
plant
seed
that
is
to
be
sown
it
is
clean
38
But
if
water
is
put
on
a
seed
and
part
of
their
dead
body
falls
on
it
the
seed
is
unclean
to
you
39
Now
if
an
animal
that
you
use
for
food
dies
whoever
touches
its
dead
body
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
40
Whoever
eats
any
of
its
dead
body
should
wash
his
garments
and
he
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
Whoever
carries
off
its
dead
body
should
wash
his
garments
and
he
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
41
Every
swarming
creature
of
the
earth
is
something
loathsome
It
must
not
be
eaten
42
You
must
not
eat
any
creature
that
crawls
on
its
belly
any
creature
that
goes
on
all
fours
or
any
of
earths
swarming
creatures
with
a
great
number
of
legs
for
they
are
something
loathsome
43
Do
not
make
yourselves
loathsome
by
means
of
any
swarming
creature
and
do
not
defile
yourselves
and
become
unclean
by
them
44
For
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
and
you
must
sanctify
yourselves
and
become
holy
because
I
am
holy
So
you
must
not
make
yourselves
unclean
by
any
swarming
creature
that
moves
on
the
earth
45
For
I
am
Jehovah
who
is
leading
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
to
prove
myself
God
to
you
and
you
must
be
holy
because
I
am
holy
46
This
is
the
law
about
the
animals
the
flying
creatures
every
living
creature
that
moves
through
the
waters
and
concerning
every
creature
that
swarms
on
the
earth
47
in
order
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
unclean
and

clean
and
between
the
living
creatures
that

and

that

not
be
eaten
1
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
to
Moses
2
Tell
the
Israelites
If
a
woman
becomes
pregnant
and
gives
birth
to
a
male
she
will
be
unclean
for
seven
days
just
as
she
is
in
the
days
of
the
impurity
when
she
is
menstruating
3
On
the
eighth
day
the
flesh
of
his
foreskin
will
be
circumcised
4
She
will
continue
cleansing
herself
from
the
blood
for
the
next
33
days
She
should
not
touch
any
holy
thing
and
she
should
not
come
into
the
holy
place
until
she
fulfills
the
days
of
her
purification
5
If
she
should
give
birth
to
a
female
she
will
then
be
unclean
for
14
days
just
as
she
would
be
during
her
menstruation
She
will
continue
cleansing
herself
from
the
blood
for
the
next
66
days
6
When
the
days
of
her
purification
for
a
son
or
a
daughter
are
completed
she
will
bring
a
young
ram
in
its
first
year
for
a
burnt
offering
and
a
young
pigeon
or
a
turtledove
for
a
sin
offering
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
to
the
priest
7
He
will
present
it
before
Jehovah
and
make
atonement
for
her
and
she
will
be
clean
from
her
flow
of
blood
This
is
the
law
about
the
woman
who
gives
birth
to
either
a
male
or
a
female
8
But
if
she
cannot
afford
a
sheep
she
must
then
take
two
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
one
for
a
burnt
offering
and
one
for
a
sin
offering
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
her
and
she
will
be
clean
1
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
and
Aaron
saying
2
If
a
man
develops
on
his
skin
a
swelling
a
scab
or
a
blotch
and
it
could
become
the
disease
of
leprosy
on
his
skin
he
must
then
be
brought
to
Aaron
the
priest
or
to
one
of
his
sons
the
priests
3
The
priest
will
examine
the
infection
on
his
skin
When
the
hair
in
the
infection
has
turned
white
and
the
appearance
of
the
infection
is
deeper
than
the
skin
it
is
the
disease
of
leprosy
The
priest
will
examine
it
and
declare
him
unclean
4
But
if
the
blotch
on
his
skin
is
white
and
its
appearance
is
not
deeper
than
the
skin
and
the
hair
has
not
turned
white
the
priest
will
then
quarantine
the
infected
person
for
seven
days
5
The
priest
will
then
examine
him
on
the
seventh
day
and
if
it
appears
that
the
infection
has
stopped
and
has
not
spread
on
the
skin
the
priest
will
quarantine
him
for
another
seven
days
6
The
priest
should
examine
him
again
on
the
seventh
day
and
if
the
infection
has
faded
and
has
not
spread
in
the
skin
the
priest
will
declare
him
clean
it
was
only
a
scab
The
man
will
then
wash
his
garments
and
be
clean
7
But
if
the
scab
has
definitely
spread
on
the
skin
after
he
appears
before
the
priest
to
establish
his
purification
he
will
then
appear
again
before
the
priest
8
The
priest
will
examine
it
and
if
the
scab
has
spread
in
the
skin
the
priest
will
then
declare
him
unclean
It
is
leprosy
9
If
the
disease
of
leprosy
develops
in
a
man
he
must
then
be
brought
to
the
priest
10
and
the
priest
will
examine
him
If
there
is
a
white
swelling
on
the
skin
and
it
has
turned
the
hair
white
and
there
is
an
open
sore
in
the
swelling
11
it
is
chronic
leprosy
on
his
skin
and
the
priest
will
declare
him
unclean
He
should
not
quarantine
him
for
he
is
unclean
12
Now
if
the
leprosy
breaks
out
all
over
the
skin
and
the
leprosy
covers
the
person
with
the
disease
from
head
to
foot
as
far
as
the
priest
can
see
13
and
the
priest
has
examined
him
and
sees
that
the
leprosy
has
covered
all
his
skin
he
will
then
declare
the
infected
person
clean
All
of
it
has
turned
white
and
he
is
clean
14
But
whenever
an
open
sore
appears
in
it
he
will
be
unclean
15
When
the
priest
sees
the
open
sore
he
will
declare
him
unclean
The
open
sore
is
unclean
It
is
leprosy
16
But
if
the
open
sore
again
turns
white
he
will
then
come
to
the
priest
17
The
priest
will
examine
him
and
if
the
infection
has
turned
white
the
priest
will
then
declare
the
infected
person
clean
He
is
clean
18
If
a
person
develops
a
boil
on
his
skin
and
it
heals
19
but
in
the
place
of
the
boil
a
white
swelling
or
a
reddish-white
blotch
has
developed
he
must
then
show
himself
to
the
priest
20
The
priest
will
examine
it
and
if
it
appears
to
be
deeper
than
the
skin
and
its
hair
has
turned
white
the
priest
will
then
declare
him
unclean
It
is
the
disease
of
leprosy
that
has
broken
out
in
the
boil
21
But
if
the
priest
examines
it
and
sees
that
there
is
no
white
hair
in
it
and
it
is
not
deeper
than
the
skin
and
appears
faded
the
priest
will
then
quarantine
him
for
seven
days
22
And
if
it
has
clearly
spread
on
the
skin
the
priest
will
then
declare
him
unclean
It
is
a
disease
23
But
if
the
blotch
stays
in
one
place
and
has
not
spread
it
is
only
the
inflammation
from
the
boil
and
the
priest
will
declare
him
clean
24
Or
if
someone
has
a
scar
from
the
fire
and
the
raw
flesh
of
the
scar
becomes
a
reddish-white
blotch
or
a
white
one
25
the
priest
will
then
examine
it
If
the
hair
in
the
blotch
has
turned
white
and
it
appears
to
be
deeper
than
the
skin
it
is
leprosy
that
has
broken
out
in
the
scar
and
the
priest
will
declare
him
unclean
It
is
the
disease
of
leprosy
26
But
if
the
priest
examines
it
and
sees
that
there
is
no
white
hair
in
the
blotch
and
it
is
not
deeper
than
the
skin
and
it
is
faded
the
priest
will
then
quarantine
him
for
seven
days
27
The
priest
will
examine
him
on
the
seventh
day
and
if
it
has
clearly
spread
on
the
skin
the
priest
will
then
declare
him
unclean
It
is
the
disease
of
leprosy
28
But
if
the
blotch
stays
in
one
place
and
has
not
spread
over
the
skin
and
it
is
faded
it
is
only
a
swelling
of
the
scar
and
the
priest
will
declare
him
clean
because
it
is
an
inflammation
of
the
scar
29
When
a
man
or
a
woman
develops
an
infection
on
the
head
or
on
the
chin
30
the
priest
will
then
examine
the
infection
If
it
appears
to
be
deeper
than
the
skin
and
the
hair
is
yellow
and
thin
the
priest
will
then
declare
such
one
unclean
it
is
an
infection
of
the
scalp
or
the
beard
It
is
leprosy
of
the
head
or
of
the
chin
31
But
if
the
priest
sees
that
the
infection
does
not
appear
to
be
deeper
than
the
skin
and
there
is
no
black
hair
in
it
the
priest
should
quarantine
the
infected
person
for
seven
days
32
The
priest
will
examine
the
infection
on
the
seventh
day
and
if
the
infected
area
has
not
spread
and
no
yellow
hair
has
developed
in
it
and
the
appearance
of
the
infected
area
is
not
deeper
than
the
skin
33
the
person
should
have
himself
shaved
but
he
will
not
have
the
infected
area
shaved
Then
the
priest
will
quarantine
the
infected
person
for
seven
days
34
The
priest
will
again
examine
the
infected
area
on
the
seventh
day
and
if
the
infection
of
the
scalp
and
beard
has
not
spread
on
the
skin
and
it
does
not
appear
deeper
than
the
skin
the
priest
must
then
declare
him
clean
and
he
should
wash
his
garments
and
be
clean
35
But
if
the
infection
clearly
spreads
on
the
skin
after
his
purification
36
the
priest
will
examine
him
and
if
the
infection
has
spread
on
the
skin
the
priest
does
not
need
to
look
for
yellow
hair
that
person
is
unclean
37
But
if
the
examination
shows
that
the
infection
has
not
spread
and
black
hair
has
grown
on
it
the
infection
has
been
healed
He
is
clean
and
the
priest
will
declare
him
clean
38
If
a
man
or
a
woman
develops
blotches
on
the
skin
and
the
blotches
are
white
39
the
priest
will
examine
them
If
the
skin
blotches
are
faded
white
it
is
a
harmless
rash
that
has
broken
out
on
the
skin
That
person
is
clean
40
If
a
man
loses
the
hair
of
his
head
and
becomes
bald
he
is
clean
41
If
he
loses
the
hair
on
the
front
of
his
head
and
becomes
bald
there
he
is
clean
42
But
if
a
reddish-white
sore
develops
on
the
bald
part
of
his
scalp
or
on
his
forehead
it
is
leprosy
breaking
out
on
his
scalp
or
on
his
forehead
43
The
priest
will
examine
him
and
if
the
swelling
from
the
infection
is
reddish-white
on
the
bald
spot
on
top
of
his
head
or
on
his
forehead
and
it
looks
like
leprosy
on
his
skin
44
he
is
a
leper
He
is
unclean
and
the
priest
should
declare
him
unclean
because
of
the
disease
on
his
head
45
As
for
the
leper
who
has
the
disease
his
garments
should
be
torn
and
his
head
should
be
left
ungroomed
and
he
should
cover
over
his
mustache
and
call
out
Unclean
unclean
46
He
will
be
unclean
the
whole
time
that
he
has
the
disease
Since
he
is
unclean
he
should
live
in
isolation
His
dwelling
place
will
be
outside
the
camp
47
If
the
disease
of
leprosy
contaminates
a
garment
whether
a
woolen
or
a
linen
garment
48
either
in
the
warp
or
in
the
woof
of
the
linen
or
of
the
wool
or
in
a
skin
or
in
anything
made
of
skin
49
and
the
yellowish-green
or
reddish
stain
from
the
disease
contaminates
the
garment
a
skin
the
warp
the
woof
or
any
article
of
skin
it
is
a
contamination
from
leprosy
and
it
should
be
shown
to
the
priest
50
The
priest
will
examine
the
disease
and
he
must
quarantine
the
disease
for
seven
days
51
When
he
examines
the
disease
on
the
seventh
day
and
sees
that
it
has
spread
in
the
garment
in
the
warp
in
the
woof
or
in
the
skin
regardless
of
what
the
skin
is
used
for
the
disease
is
malignant
leprosy
and
it
is
unclean
52
He
should
burn
the
garment
or
the
warp
or
the
woof
in
the
wool
or
in
the
linen
or
any
article
of
skin
in
which
the
disease
has
developed
for
it
is
malignant
leprosy
It
should
be
burned
in
the
fire
53
But
if
the
priest
examines
it
and
the
disease
has
not
spread
in
the
garment
or
in
the
warp
or
in
the
woof
or
in
any
article
of
skin
54
the
priest
will
then
command
that
they
should
wash
the
contaminated
item
and
he
will
quarantine
it
for
another
seven
days
55
The
priest
will
then
examine
the
contaminated
item
after
it
has
been
thoroughly
washed
If
the
appearance
of
the
contamination
has
not
changed
even
if
the
disease
has
not
spread
it
is
unclean
You
should
burn
it
in
the
fire
because
it
has
been
eaten
away
either
from
its
underside
or
from
its
outside
56
But
if
the
priest
has
examined
it
and
the
contaminated
part
is
faded
after
it
has
been
thoroughly
washed
he
will
then
tear
it
out
of
the
garment
or
the
skin
or
the
warp
or
the
woof
57
However
if
it
still
appears
in
another
part
of
the
garment
or
in
the
warp
or
in
the
woof
or
in
any
article
of
skin
it
is
spreading
and
you
should
burn
any
contaminated
item
in
the
fire
58
But
when
the
contamination
disappears
from
the
garment
or
the
warp
or
the
woof
or
any
article
of
skin
that
you
wash
it
should
then
be
washed
a
second
time
and
it
will
be
clean
59
This
is
the
law
of
the
disease
of
leprosy
in
a
garment
of
wool
or
of
linen
or
in
the
warp
or
in
the
woof
or
in
any
article
of
skin
for
declaring
it
clean
or
unclean
1
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
2
This
is
to
be
the
law
of
the
leper
on
the
day
his
purification
is
established
when
he
is
to
be
brought
to
the
priest
3
The
priest
will
go
outside
the
camp
and
examine
him
If
the
leper
has
been
cured
of
the
leprosy
4
the
priest
will
command
him
to
bring
two
live
clean
birds
cedarwood
scarlet
material
and
hyssop
for
his
cleansing
5
The
priest
will
command
that
the
one
bird
be
killed
in
an
earthenware
vessel
over
running
water
6
But
he
should
take
the
living
bird
along
with
the
cedarwood
the
scarlet
material
and
the
hyssop
and
dip
them
together
in
the
blood
of
the
bird
that
was
killed
over
the
running
water
7
Then
he
will
spatter
it
seven
times
on
the
one
cleansing
himself
from
the
leprosy
and
declare
him
clean
and
he
will
set
the
living
bird
free
in
the
open
field
8
The
one
cleansing
himself
must
wash
his
garments
and
shave
off
all
his
hair
and
bathe
in
water
and
he
will
be
clean
Afterward
he
may
come
into
the
camp
but
he
will
dwell
outside
his
tent
for
seven
days
9
On
the
seventh
day
he
should
shave
off
all
the
hair
on
his
head
and
his
chin
and
his
eyebrows
After
he
shaves
off
all
his
hair
he
will
wash
his
garments
and
bathe
himself
in
water
and
he
will
be
clean
10
On
the
eighth
day
he
will
take
two
sound
young
rams
one
sound
female
lamb
in
its
first
year
three
tenths
of
an
ephah
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
oil
as
a
grain
offering
and
one
log
measure
of
oil
11
and
the
priest
who
declares
him
clean
will
present
the
man
who
is
cleansing
himself
along
with
the
offerings
before
Jehovah
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
12
The
priest
will
take
the
one
young
ram
and
offer
it
as
a
guilt
offering
together
with
the
log
measure
of
oil
and
he
will
wave
them
back
and
forth
as
a
wave
offering
before
Jehovah
13
Then
he
will
slaughter
the
young
ram
in
the
place
where
the
sin
offering
and
the
burnt
offering
are
usually
slaughtered
in
a
holy
place
because
like
the
sin
offering
the
guilt
offering
belongs
to
the
priest
It
is
something
most
holy
14
Then
the
priest
will
take
some
of
the
blood
of
the
guilt
offering
and
the
priest
will
put
it
on
the
right
earlobe
of
the
one
cleansing
himself
and
on
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
and
on
the
big
toe
of
his
right
foot
15
And
the
priest
will
take
some
of
the
log
measure
of
oil
and
pour
it
into
his
own
left
palm
16
The
priest
will
then
dip
his
right
finger
into
the
oil
that
is
in
his
left
palm
and
spatter
some
of
the
oil
with
his
finger
seven
times
before
Jehovah
17
Then
the
priest
will
put
some
of
the
remaining
oil
in
his
palm
on
the
right
earlobe
of
the
one
cleansing
himself
and
on
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
and
on
the
big
toe
of
his
right
foot
over
the
blood
of
the
guilt
offering
18
The
priest
will
put
what
is
left
over
of
the
oil
in
his
palm
on
the
head
of
the
one
cleansing
himself
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
before
Jehovah
19
The
priest
will
sacrifice
the
sin
offering
and
make
atonement
for
the
one
cleansing
himself
from
his
impurity
and
afterward
he
will
slaughter
the
burnt
offering
20
And
the
priest
will
offer
up
the
burnt
offering
and
the
grain
offering
on
the
altar
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
and
he
will
be
clean
21
However
if
he
is
poor
and
does
not
have
enough
means
he
will
then
take
one
young
ram
as
a
guilt
offering
for
a
wave
offering
in
order
to
make
atonement
for
himself
along
with
one
tenth
of
an
ephah
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
oil
as
a
grain
offering
a
log
measure
of
oil
22
and
two
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
according
to
his
means
The
one
will
serve
as
a
sin
offering
and
the
other
as
a
burnt
offering
23
On
the
eighth
day
he
will
bring
them
for
establishing
his
purification
to
the
priest
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
before
Jehovah
24
The
priest
will
take
the
young
ram
of
the
guilt
offering
and
the
log
measure
of
oil
and
the
priest
will
wave
them
back
and
forth
as
a
wave
offering
before
Jehovah
25
He
will
then
slaughter
the
young
ram
of
the
guilt
offering
and
the
priest
will
take
some
of
the
blood
of
the
guilt
offering
and
put
it
on
the
right
earlobe
of
the
one
cleansing
himself
and
on
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
and
on
the
big
toe
of
his
right
foot
26
The
priest
will
pour
some
of
the
oil
into
his
own
left
palm
27
and
he
will
then
spatter
with
his
right
finger
some
of
the
oil
that
is
in
his
left
palm
seven
times
before
Jehovah
28
And
the
priest
will
put
some
of
the
oil
that
is
in
his
palm
on
the
right
earlobe
of
the
one
cleansing
himself
and
on
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
and
on
the
big
toe
of
his
right
foot
on
the
same
places
that
he
put
the
blood
of
the
guilt
offering
29
The
priest
will
then
put
what
is
left
over
of
the
oil
in
his
palm
on
the
head
of
the
one
cleansing
himself
in
order
to
make
atonement
for
him
before
Jehovah
30
He
will
offer
up
one
of
the
turtledoves
or
one
of
the
young
pigeons
according
to
his
means
31
the
one
he
can
afford
as
a
sin
offering
and
the
other
as
a
burnt
offering
along
with
the
grain
offering
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
the
one
cleansing
himself
before
Jehovah
32
This
is
the
law
for
the
one
in
whom
the
disease
of
leprosy
was
but
who
does
not
have
the
means
when
establishing
his
purification
33
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
34
When
you
come
into
the
land
of
Canaan
which
I
am
giving
you
as
a
possession
and
I
contaminate
a
house
in
your
land
with
the
disease
of
leprosy
35
the
one
to
whom
the
house
belongs
should
then
come
and
tell
the
priest
Some
kind
of
contamination
has
appeared
in
my
house
36
The
priest
will
give
orders
to
clear
out
the
house
before
he
comes
to
examine
the
contamination
in
order
that
he
may
not
declare
everything
that
is
in
the
house
unclean
and
after
that
the
priest
will
come
in
to
inspect
the
house
37
He
will
examine
the
affected
area
and
if
the
walls
of
the
house
are
contaminated
with
yellowish-green
or
reddish
depressions
and
they
appear
to
be
deeper
than
the
wall
surface
38
the
priest
will
then
go
out
of
the
house
to
the
entryway
of
the
house
and
quarantine
the
house
for
seven
days
39
Then
the
priest
will
return
on
the
seventh
day
and
make
an
inspection
If
the
contamination
has
spread
in
the
walls
of
the
house
40
the
priest
will
then
give
orders
and
the
contaminated
stones
must
be
torn
out
and
thrown
outside
the
city
into
an
unclean
place
41
Then
he
is
to
have
the
inside
of
the
house
thoroughly
scraped
and
the
plaster
and
mortar
that
is
removed
should
be
discarded
outside
the
city
in
an
unclean
place
42
They
will
then
insert
other
stones
in
the
place
of
the
stones
they
removed
and
he
should
use
different
mortar
and
have
the
house
plastered
43
If
though
the
contamination
returns
and
breaks
out
in
the
house
after
the
stones
were
torn
out
and
the
house
was
scraped
and
replastered
44
the
priest
will
then
go
in
and
inspect
it
If
the
contamination
has
spread
in
the
house
it
is
malignant
leprosy
in
the
house
The
house
is
unclean
45
He
will
then
have
the
house
pulled
down—its
stones
its
timbers
and
all
the
plaster
and
mortar
of
the
house—and
carried
outside
the
city
to
an
unclean
place
46
But
whoever
enters
the
house
any
of
the
days
it
is
quarantined
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
47
and
whoever
lies
down
in
the
house
should
wash
his
garments
and
whoever
eats
in
the
house
should
wash
his
garments
48
However
if
the
priest
comes
and
sees
that
the
contamination
has
not
spread
in
the
house
after
the
house
was
replastered
the
priest
will
then
declare
the
house
clean
because
the
contamination
has
been
healed
49
In
order
to
purify
the
house
from
uncleanness
he
will
take
two
birds
cedarwood
scarlet
material
and
hyssop
50
He
is
to
kill
the
one
bird
in
an
earthenware
vessel
over
running
water
51
Then
he
will
take
the
cedarwood
the
hyssop
the
scarlet
material
and
the
live
bird
and
dip
them
in
the
blood
of
the
bird
that
was
killed
and
in
the
running
water
and
he
must
spatter
it
toward
the
house
seven
times
52
And
he
will
purify
the
house
from
uncleanness
with
the
blood
of
the
bird
the
running
water
the
live
bird
the
cedarwood
the
hyssop
and
the
scarlet
material
53
He
will
then
set
the
live
bird
free
outside
the
city
in
the
open
field
and
make
atonement
for
the
house
and
it
will
be
clean
54
This
is
the
law
respecting
any
case
of
leprosy
infection
of
the
scalp
or
the
beard
55
leprosy
of
the
garment
or
the
house
56
and
respecting
swellings
scabs
and
blotches
57
in
order
to
determine
when
something
is
unclean
and
when
something
is
clean
This
is
the
law
about
leprosy
1
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
and
Aaron
saying
2
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
If
a
man
has
a
discharge
from
his
genital
organ
this
discharge
makes
him
unclean
3
He
is
unclean
from
the
discharge
whether
the
discharge
continues
to
flow
from
his
genitals
or
is
obstructed
he
is
still
unclean
4
Any
bed
that
the
one
with
the
discharge
lies
on
will
be
unclean
and
anything
he
sits
on
will
be
unclean
5
A
man
who
touches
his
bed
must
wash
his
garments
and
he
should
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
6
Anyone
who
sits
on
an
article
that
the
one
having
a
discharge
sat
on
should
wash
his
garments
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
7
Whoever
touches
the
flesh
of
the
one
having
a
discharge
should
wash
his
garments
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
8
If
the
one
who
has
a
discharge
spits
on
someone
clean
that
person
must
wash
his
garments
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
9
Any
saddle
that
the
one
with
the
discharge
rides
on
will
be
unclean
10
Anyone
touching
anything
that
was
under
him
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
and
anyone
who
carries
those
items
will
wash
his
garments
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
11
If
the
one
with
the
discharge
has
not
washed
his
hands
in
water
and
he
touches
someone
that
person
must
then
wash
his
garments
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
12
An
earthenware
vessel
that
the
one
having
a
discharge
touches
should
be
smashed
and
any
wooden
vessel
should
be
washed
with
water
13
When
the
discharge
stops
and
the
person
becomes
clean
from
it
he
will
then
count
seven
days
for
his
purification
and
he
must
wash
his
garments
bathe
himself
in
running
water
and
he
will
be
clean
14
On
the
eighth
day
he
should
take
two
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
and
come
before
Jehovah
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
give
them
to
the
priest
15
And
the
priest
will
offer
them
the
one
as
a
sin
offering
and
the
other
as
a
burnt
offering
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
before
Jehovah
concerning
his
discharge
16
Now
if
a
man
has
an
emission
of
semen
he
should
bathe
his
whole
body
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
17
He
must
wash
with
water
any
garment
and
any
skin
with
semen
on
it
and
it
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
18
When
a
man
lies
with
a
woman
and
has
an
emission
of
semen
they
should
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
19
If
a
woman
has
a
discharge
of
blood
from
her
body
she
will
continue
in
her
menstrual
impurity
for
seven
days
Anyone
touching
her
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
20
Anything
she
lies
down
on
in
her
menstrual
impurity
will
be
unclean
and
everything
she
sits
on
will
be
unclean
21
Anyone
touching
her
bed
should
wash
his
garments
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
22
Anyone
touching
any
article
she
sat
on
should
wash
his
garments
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
23
If
she
sat
on
the
bed
or
on
another
article
his
touching
it
will
make
him
unclean
until
the
evening
24
And
if
a
man
lies
down
with
her
and
her
menstrual
impurity
comes
on
him
he
will
then
be
unclean
for
seven
days
and
any
bed
on
which
he
lies
down
will
be
unclean
25
When
a
womans
discharge
of
blood
flows
for
many
days
when
it
is
not
the
regular
time
of
her
menstruation
or
if
she
should
have
a
flow
longer
than
her
usual
menstruation
she
will
be
unclean
during
all
the
days
of
her
discharge
as
in
the
days
of
her
menstrual
impurity
26
Any
bed
she
lies
on
during
the
days
of
her
discharge
will
become
like
the
bed
of
her
menstrual
impurity
and
any
article
she
sits
on
will
become
unclean
like
the
uncleanness
of
her
menstrual
impurity
27
Anyone
touching
them
will
be
unclean
and
he
must
wash
his
garments
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
28
However
when
she
is
clean
from
her
discharge
she
will
count
for
herself
seven
days
and
afterward
she
will
be
clean
29
On
the
eighth
day
she
should
take
two
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
and
she
will
bring
them
to
the
priest
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
30
The
priest
will
make
the
one
a
sin
offering
and
the
other
a
burnt
offering
and
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
her
before
Jehovah
concerning
her
unclean
discharge
31
Thus
you
must
keep
the
Israelites
separate
from
their
uncleanness
so
that
they
do
not
die
in
their
uncleanness
by
defiling
my
tabernacle
which
is
in
their
midst
32
This
is
the
law
about
the
man
having
a
discharge
the
man
who
is
unclean
because
of
an
emission
of
semen
33
the
woman
during
her
menstrual
impurity
any
male
or
female
who
has
a
discharge
flowing
from
the
body
and
a
man
who
lies
down
with
an
unclean
woman
1
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
after
the
death
of
Aarons
two
sons
who
died
for
approaching
Jehovah
2
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Tell
Aaron
your
brother
that
he
may
not
come
at
just
any
time
into
the
holy
place
inside
the
curtain
in
front
of
the
cover
on
the
Ark
so
that
he
may
not
die
for
I
will
appear
over
the
cover
in
a
cloud
3
This
is
what
Aaron
should
bring
when
he
comes
into
the
holy
place
a
young
bull
for
a
sin
offering
and
a
ram
for
a
burnt
offering
4
He
should
put
on
the
holy
linen
robe
and
the
linen
shorts
should
cover
his
body
and
he
should
wrap
himself
with
the
linen
sash
and
his
head
with
the
linen
turban
They
are
holy
garments
He
will
bathe
himself
in
water
and
put
them
on
5
He
should
take
from
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
two
young
male
goats
for
a
sin
offering
and
one
ram
for
a
burnt
offering
6
Aaron
must
then
present
the
bull
of
the
sin
offering
which
is
for
himself
and
he
will
make
atonement
in
behalf
of
himself
and
his
house
7
He
will
then
take
the
two
goats
and
make
them
stand
before
Jehovah
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
8
Aaron
will
draw
lots
over
the
two
goats
the
one
lot
for
Jehovah
and
the
other
lot
for
Azazel
9
Aaron
will
present
the
goat
that
was
designated
by
lot
for
Jehovah
and
make
it
a
sin
offering
10
But
the
goat
designated
by
lot
for
Azazel
should
be
brought
alive
to
stand
before
Jehovah
in
order
to
perform
the
atonement
upon
it
so
that
it
may
be
sent
away
for
Azazel
into
the
wilderness
11
Aaron
will
present
the
bull
of
the
sin
offering
which
is
for
himself
and
make
atonement
in
behalf
of
himself
and
his
house
afterward
he
will
slaughter
the
bull
of
the
sin
offering
which
is
for
himself
12
He
will
then
take
the
fire
holder
full
of
burning
coals
from
the
altar
before
Jehovah
and
two
handfuls
of
fine
perfumed
incense
and
he
will
bring
them
inside
the
curtain
13
He
will
also
put
the
incense
on
the
fire
before
Jehovah
and
the
cloud
of
the
incense
will
envelop
the
Ark
cover
which
is
on
the
Testimony
so
that
he
may
not
die
14
He
will
take
some
of
the
bulls
blood
and
spatter
it
with
his
finger
in
front
of
the
cover
on
the
east
side
and
he
will
spatter
some
of
the
blood
with
his
finger
seven
times
before
the
cover
15
He
will
then
slaughter
the
goat
of
the
sin
offering
which
is
for
the
people
and
bring
its
blood
inside
the
curtain
and
do
with
its
blood
the
same
as
he
did
with
the
bulls
blood
he
is
to
spatter
it
toward
the
cover
and
before
the
cover
16
He
must
make
atonement
for
the
holy
place
concerning
the
acts
of
uncleanness
of
the
Israelites
and
concerning
their
transgressions
and
their
sins
and
that
is
what
he
should
do
for
the
tent
of
meeting
which
is
located
among
them
in
the
midst
of
their
acts
of
uncleanness
17
No
other
man
should
be
in
the
tent
of
meeting
from
the
time
he
goes
in
to
make
atonement
in
the
holy
place
until
he
comes
out
He
will
make
atonement
in
behalf
of
himself
and
his
house
and
in
behalf
of
the
entire
congregation
of
Israel
18
He
will
then
come
out
to
the
altar
which
is
before
Jehovah
and
make
atonement
for
it
and
he
will
take
some
of
the
bulls
blood
and
some
of
the
goats
blood
and
put
it
on
the
horns
of
the
altar
on
all
sides
19
He
will
also
spatter
some
of
the
blood
on
it
with
his
finger
seven
times
and
cleanse
it
and
sanctify
it
from
the
acts
of
uncleanness
of
the
Israelites
20
When
he
has
finished
making
atonement
for
the
holy
place
and
the
tent
of
meeting
and
the
altar
he
will
also
present
the
live
goat
21
Aaron
will
lay
both
his
hands
on
the
head
of
the
live
goat
and
confess
over
it
all
the
errors
of
the
Israelites
and
all
their
transgressions
and
all
their
sins
and
he
will
put
them
on
the
head
of
the
goat
and
send
it
away
into
the
wilderness
by
the
hand
of
a
man
designated
to
do
this
22
The
goat
will
carry
upon
itself
all
their
errors
into
a
desert
land
and
he
will
send
the
goat
away
into
the
wilderness
23
Aaron
will
then
enter
into
the
tent
of
meeting
and
take
off
the
linen
garments
that
he
put
on
when
he
went
into
the
holy
place
and
he
will
lay
them
down
there
24
He
must
bathe
himself
in
water
in
a
holy
place
and
put
on
his
garments
then
he
will
come
out
and
offer
up
his
burnt
offering
and
the
peoples
burnt
offering
and
make
atonement
in
his
own
behalf
and
in
behalf
of
the
people
25
He
will
make
the
fat
of
the
sin
offering
smoke
on
the
altar
26
The
man
who
sent
away
the
goat
for
Azazel
should
wash
his
garments
and
bathe
himself
in
water
and
after
that
he
may
come
into
the
camp
27
And
the
bull
of
the
sin
offering
and
the
goat
of
the
sin
offering
whose
blood
was
brought
into
the
holy
place
to
make
atonement
will
be
taken
outside
the
camp
and
their
skins
and
their
flesh
and
their
dung
will
be
burned
in
the
fire
28
The
one
who
burns
them
should
wash
his
garments
and
bathe
himself
in
water
and
after
that
he
may
come
into
the
camp
29
It
will
serve
as
a
lasting
statute
for
you
In
the
seventh
month
on
the
tenth
of
the
month
you
should
afflict
yourselves
and
you
must
not
do
any
work
whether
a
native
or
a
foreigner
who
is
residing
among
you
30
On
this
day
atonement
will
be
made
for
you
to
declare
you
clean
You
will
be
clean
from
all
your
sins
before
Jehovah
31
It
is
a
sabbath
of
complete
rest
for
you
and
you
should
afflict
yourselves
It
is
a
lasting
statute
32
The
priest
who
is
anointed
and
installed
to
serve
as
priest
in
place
of
his
father
will
make
atonement
and
put
on
the
linen
garments
the
holy
garments
33
He
will
make
atonement
for
the
holy
sanctuary
the
tent
of
meeting
and
the
altar
and
he
will
make
atonement
for
the
priests
and
for
all
the
people
of
the
congregation
34
This
will
serve
as
a
lasting
statute
for
you
to
make
atonement
for
the
Israelites
concerning
all
their
sins
once
each
year
So
he
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
1
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
to
Moses
2
Speak
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
and
all
the
Israelites
and
say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
commanded
3
If
any
man
of
the
house
of
Israel
slaughters
a
bull
or
a
young
ram
or
a
goat
in
the
camp
or
if
he
slaughters
it
outside
the
camp
4
instead
of
bringing
it
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
to
present
it
as
an
offering
to
Jehovah
before
the
tabernacle
of
Jehovah
bloodguilt
will
be
counted
to
that
man
He
has
shed
blood
and
that
man
must
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people
5
This
is
so
that
the
Israelites
will
bring
the
sacrifices
which
they
now
sacrifice
in
the
open
field
to
Jehovah
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
to
the
priest
They
are
to
sacrifice
these
as
communion
sacrifices
to
Jehovah
6
And
the
priest
will
sprinkle
the
blood
on
Jehovahs
altar
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
make
the
fat
smoke
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
7
So
they
should
no
longer
offer
sacrifices
to
the
goatlike
demons
with
which
they
are
prostituting
themselves
This
will
serve
as
a
lasting
statute
for
you
throughout
your
generations
8
You
should
say
to
them
Any
man
of
the
house
of
Israel
or
any
foreigner
who
is
residing
in
your
midst
who
offers
up
a
burnt
offering
or
a
sacrifice
9
and
does
not
bring
it
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
to
offer
it
to
Jehovah
must
be
cut
off
from
his
people
10
If
any
man
of
the
house
of
Israel
or
any
foreigner
who
is
residing
in
your
midst
eats
any
sort
of
blood
I
will
certainly
set
my
face
against
the
one
who
is
eating
the
blood
and
I
will
cut
him
off
from
among
his
people
11
For
the
life
of
the
flesh
is
in
the
blood
and
I
myself
have
given
it
on
the
altar
for
you
to
make
atonement
for
yourselves
because
it
is
the
blood
that
makes
atonement
by
means
of
the
life
in
it
12
That
is
why
I
have
said
to
the
Israelites
None
of
you
should
eat
blood
and
no
foreigner
who
is
residing
in
your
midst
should
eat
blood
13
If
one
of
the
Israelites
or
some
foreigner
who
is
residing
in
your
midst
is
hunting
and
catches
a
wild
animal
or
a
bird
that
may
be
eaten
he
must
pour
its
blood
out
and
cover
it
with
dust
14
For
the
life
of
every
sort
of
flesh
is
its
blood
because
the
life
is
in
it
Consequently
I
said
to
the
Israelites
You
must
not
eat
the
blood
of
any
sort
of
flesh
because
the
life
of
every
sort
of
flesh
is
its
blood
Anyone
eating
it
will
be
cut
off
15
If
anyone
whether
a
native
or
a
foreigner
eats
an
animal
found
dead
or
one
torn
by
a
wild
animal
he
must
then
wash
his
garments
and
bathe
in
water
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
then
he
will
be
clean
16
But
if
he
does
not
wash
them
and
does
not
bathe
himself
he
will
answer
for
his
error
1
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
2
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
say
to
them
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
3
You
must
not
behave
as
they
do
in
the
land
of
Egypt
where
you
were
dwelling
and
you
must
not
do
what
they
do
in
the
land
of
Canaan
where
I
am
bringing
you
And
you
must
not
walk
in
their
statutes
4
You
should
carry
out
my
judicial
decisions
and
you
should
keep
my
statutes
and
walk
in
them
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
5
You
must
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judicial
decisions
anyone
who
does
so
will
live
by
means
of
them
I
am
Jehovah
6
No
man
among
you
should
approach
any
of
his
close
relatives
to
have
sexual
relations
I
am
Jehovah
7
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
your
father
and
you
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
your
mother
She
is
your
mother
and
you
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
her
8
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
your
fathers
wife
It
is
exposing
your
father
to
shame
9
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
your
sister
either
the
daughter
of
your
father
or
the
daughter
of
your
mother
whether
she
is
born
in
the
same
household
or
born
outside
of
it
10
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
the
daughter
of
your
son
or
the
daughter
of
your
daughter
because
they
are
your
own
nakedness
11
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
the
daughter
of
your
fathers
wife
the
offspring
of
your
father
because
she
is
your
sister
12
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
your
fathers
sister
She
is
your
fathers
blood
relative
13
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
your
mothers
sister
because
she
is
your
mothers
blood
relative
14
You
must
not
expose
your
fathers
brother
to
shame
by
having
sexual
relations
with
his
wife
She
is
your
aunt
15
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
your
daughter-in-law
She
is
your
sons
wife
and
you
must
not
have
relations
with
her
16
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
your
brothers
wife
because
it
is
exposing
your
brother
to
shame
17
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
a
woman
and
her
daughter
You
must
not
take
the
daughter
of
her
son
and
the
daughter
of
her
daughter
in
order
to
have
relations
They
are
her
close
relatives
it
is
an
obscene
act
18
You
must
not
take
a
woman
in
addition
to
her
sister
as
a
rival
wife
and
have
sexual
relations
with
her
while
her
sister
is
alive
19
You
must
not
approach
a
woman
during
her
menstrual
impurity
to
have
sexual
relations
with
her
20
You
must
not
have
sexual
intercourse
with
the
wife
of
your
fellow
man
making
yourself
unclean
21
You
must
not
allow
any
of
your
offspring
to
be
offered
to
Molech
You
must
not
profane
the
name
of
your
God
in
that
way
I
am
Jehovah
22
You
must
not
lie
down
with
a
male
in
the
same
way
that
you
lie
down
with
a
woman
It
is
a
detestable
act
23
A
man
must
not
have
sexual
intercourse
with
an
animal
to
become
unclean
by
it
nor
should
a
woman
offer
herself
to
an
animal
to
have
intercourse
with
it
It
is
a
violation
of
what
is
natural
24
Do
not
make
yourselves
unclean
by
any
of
these
things
for
it
is
by
all
these
things
that
the
nations
that
I
am
driving
out
from
before
you
have
made
themselves
unclean
25
Therefore
the
land
is
unclean
and
I
will
bring
punishment
on
it
for
its
error
and
the
land
will
vomit
its
inhabitants
out
26
But
you
yourselves
must
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judicial
decisions
and
you
must
not
do
any
of
these
detestable
things
whether
a
native
or
a
foreigner
who
is
residing
among
you
27
For
all
these
detestable
things
were
done
by
the
men
who
lived
in
the
land
before
you
and
now
the
land
is
unclean
28
Then
the
land
will
not
have
to
vomit
you
out
for
defiling
it
in
the
same
way
that
it
will
vomit
out
the
nations
that
were
before
you
29
If
anyone
does
any
of
these
detestable
things
all
those
doing
them
must
be
cut
off
from
among
their
people
30
You
must
keep
your
obligation
to
me
by
not
practicing
any
of
the
detestable
customs
that
were
carried
on
before
you
so
that
you
do
not
make
yourselves
unclean
by
them
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
1
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
2
Speak
to
the
entire
assembly
of
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
You
should
be
holy
because
I
Jehovah
your
God
am
holy
3
Each
of
you
should
respect
his
mother
and
his
father
and
you
should
keep
my
sabbaths
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
4
Do
not
turn
to
worthless
gods
or
make
for
yourselves
gods
of
cast
metal
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
5
Now
if
you
offer
a
communion
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
you
should
sacrifice
it
in
such
a
way
that
you
gain
approval
for
yourselves
6
It
should
be
eaten
on
the
day
of
your
sacrifice
and
on
the
next
day
but
what
is
left
over
until
the
third
day
should
be
burned
in
the
fire
7
If
though
any
of
it
is
eaten
on
the
third
day
it
is
an
offensive
thing
that
will
not
be
accepted
with
approval
8
The
one
eating
it
will
answer
for
his
error
because
he
has
profaned
a
holy
thing
of
Jehovah
and
that
person
must
be
cut
off
from
his
people
9
When
you
reap
the
harvest
of
your
land
you
must
not
reap
the
edge
of
your
field
completely
and
you
must
not
pick
up
the
gleaning
of
your
harvest
10
Also
you
must
not
gather
the
leftovers
of
your
vineyard
or
pick
up
the
scattered
grapes
of
your
vineyard
You
should
leave
them
for
the
poor
and
the
foreign
resident
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
11
You
must
not
steal
you
must
not
deceive
and
you
must
not
deal
falsely
with
one
another
12
You
must
not
swear
to
a
lie
in
my
name
and
thus
profane
the
name
of
your
God
I
am
Jehovah
13
You
must
not
defraud
your
fellow
man
and
you
must
not
rob
You
should
not
withhold
the
wages
of
a
hired
worker
all
night
until
morning
14
You
must
not
curse
a
deaf
man
or
put
an
obstacle
before
a
blind
man
and
you
must
be
in
fear
of
your
God
I
am
Jehovah
15
You
must
not
be
unjust
in
your
judgment
You
must
not
show
partiality
to
the
poor
or
show
preference
to
the
rich
With
justice
you
should
judge
your
fellow
man
16
You
must
not
go
around
spreading
slander
among
your
people
You
must
not
stand
up
against
the
life
of
your
fellow
man
I
am
Jehovah
17
You
must
not
hate
your
brother
in
your
heart
You
should
by
all
means
reprove
your
fellow
man
so
that
you
will
not
bear
sin
along
with
him
18
You
must
not
take
vengeance
nor
hold
a
grudge
against
the
sons
of
your
people
and
you
must
love
your
fellow
man
as
yourself
I
am
Jehovah
19
You
should
keep
my
statutes
You
must
not
interbreed
two
sorts
of
your
domestic
animals
You
must
not
sow
your
field
with
two
sorts
of
seed
and
you
must
not
wear
a
garment
made
with
two
sorts
of
thread
mixed
together
20
Now
if
a
man
lies
down
with
a
woman
and
has
intercourse
with
her
and
she
is
a
servant
who
is
designated
for
another
man
but
she
has
not
been
redeemed
or
given
her
freedom
there
should
be
a
punishment
However
they
should
not
be
put
to
death
for
she
was
not
yet
set
free
21
He
should
bring
his
guilt
offering
to
Jehovah
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
a
ram
of
guilt
offering
22
The
priest
will
make
atonement
for
him
with
the
ram
of
the
guilt
offering
before
Jehovah
for
the
sin
that
he
committed
and
he
will
be
forgiven
for
the
sin
that
he
committed
23
When
you
come
into
the
land
and
you
plant
any
tree
for
food
you
must
consider
its
fruitage
impure
and
forbidden
For
three
years
it
will
be
forbidden
to
you
It
must
not
be
eaten
24
But
in
the
fourth
year
all
its
fruit
will
be
holy
for
rejoicing
before
Jehovah
25
Then
in
the
fifth
year
you
may
eat
its
fruit
in
order
to
add
its
produce
to
your
harvest
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
26
You
must
eat
nothing
containing
blood
You
must
not
look
for
omens
or
practice
magic
27
You
must
not
shave
the
hair
on
the
side
of
your
head
or
disfigure
the
edges
of
your
beard
28
You
must
not
make
cuts
in
your
flesh
for
a
dead
person
and
you
must
not
make
tattoo
markings
on
yourselves
I
am
Jehovah
29
Do
not
dishonor
your
daughter
by
making
her
a
prostitute
so
that
the
land
may
not
commit
prostitution
and
be
filled
with
loose
morals
30
You
must
keep
my
sabbaths
and
you
must
show
reverence
for
my
sanctuary
I
am
Jehovah
31
Do
not
turn
to
the
spirit
mediums
and
do
not
consult
fortune-tellers
so
as
to
become
unclean
by
them
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
32
Before
gray
hair
you
should
rise
up
and
you
must
show
honor
to
an
older
man
and
you
must
be
in
fear
of
your
God
I
am
Jehovah
33
If
a
foreigner
resides
with
you
in
your
land
you
must
not
mistreat
him
34
The
foreigner
who
resides
with
you
should
become
to
you
like
a
native
among
you
and
you
must
love
him
as
yourself
for
you
were
foreign
residents
in
the
land
of
Egypt
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
35
You
must
not
use
dishonest
standards
in
measuring
length
weight
or
volume
36
You
should
use
accurate
scales
accurate
weights
an
accurate
dry
measure
and
an
accurate
liquid
measure
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
37
So
you
must
keep
all
my
statutes
and
all
my
judicial
decisions
and
you
must
follow
them
I
am
Jehovah
1
Jehovah
went
on
speaking
to
Moses
saying
2
You
are
to
say
to
the
Israelites
Any
man
of
Israel
and
any
foreigner
who
resides
in
Israel
who
gives
any
of
his
offspring
to
Molech
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
The
people
of
the
land
should
stone
him
to
death
3
I
myself
will
set
my
face
against
that
man
and
I
will
cut
him
off
from
among
his
people
because
he
has
given
some
of
his
offspring
to
Molech
and
has
defiled
my
holy
place
and
has
profaned
my
holy
name
4
If
the
people
of
the
land
should
deliberately
close
their
eyes
to
what
that
man
does
when
he
gives
his
offspring
to
Molech
and
they
do
not
put
him
to
death
5
then
I
myself
will
certainly
set
my
face
against
that
man
and
his
family
I
will
cut
off
that
man
from
his
people
along
with
all
who
join
him
in
prostituting
themselves
to
Molech
6
As
for
the
person
who
turns
to
the
spirit
mediums
and
the
fortune-tellers
so
as
to
commit
spiritual
prostitution
with
them
I
will
certainly
turn
against
that
person
and
cut
him
off
from
his
people
7
You
must
sanctify
yourselves
and
become
holy
because
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
8
And
you
must
keep
my
statutes
and
carry
them
out
I
am
Jehovah
who
is
sanctifying
you
9
If
there
is
any
man
who
curses
his
father
or
his
mother
he
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
Since
he
has
cursed
his
father
or
his
mother
his
own
blood
is
upon
him
10
Now
regarding
a
man
who
commits
adultery
with
another
mans
wife
The
one
who
commits
adultery
with
the
wife
of
his
fellow
man
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
the
adulterer
and
the
adulteress
11
A
man
who
lies
down
with
his
fathers
wife
has
exposed
his
father
to
shame
Both
of
them
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
Their
own
blood
is
upon
them
12
If
a
man
lies
down
with
his
daughter-in-law
both
of
them
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
They
have
violated
what
is
natural
Their
own
blood
is
upon
them
13
If
a
man
lies
down
with
a
male
the
same
as
one
lies
down
with
a
woman
both
of
them
have
done
a
detestable
thing
They
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
Their
own
blood
is
upon
them
14
If
a
man
takes
a
woman
and
her
mother
it
is
an
obscene
act
They
should
burn
him
and
them
in
the
fire
so
that
obscene
conduct
may
not
continue
among
you
15
If
a
man
has
intercourse
with
a
beast
he
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
and
you
should
kill
the
beast
16
If
a
woman
approaches
any
beast
to
have
intercourse
with
it
you
must
kill
the
woman
and
the
beast
They
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
Their
own
blood
is
upon
them
17
If
a
man
has
sexual
relations
with
his
sister
the
daughter
of
his
father
or
the
daughter
of
his
mother
and
he
sees
her
nakedness
and
she
sees
his
nakedness
it
is
a
disgrace
They
must
be
cut
off
before
the
eyes
of
the
sons
of
their
people
He
has
exposed
his
sister
to
shame
He
should
answer
for
his
error
18
If
a
man
lies
down
with
a
menstruating
woman
and
has
sexual
relations
with
her
both
he
and
she
have
exposed
her
flow
of
blood
Both
of
them
must
be
cut
off
from
among
their
people
19
You
must
not
have
sexual
relations
with
your
mothers
sister
or
your
fathers
sister
because
that
would
be
exposing
a
blood
relative
to
shame
They
should
answer
for
their
error
20
A
man
who
lies
down
with
his
uncles
wife
has
exposed
his
uncle
to
shame
They
should
answer
for
their
sin
They
should
die
childless
21
If
a
man
takes
his
brothers
wife
it
is
something
abhorrent
He
has
exposed
his
brother
to
shame
They
should
become
childless
22
You
must
keep
all
my
statutes
and
all
my
judicial
decisions
and
carry
them
out
so
that
the
land
where
I
am
bringing
you
to
dwell
will
not
vomit
you
out
23
You
must
not
walk
in
the
statutes
of
the
nations
that
I
am
driving
out
from
before
you
for
they
have
done
all
these
things
and
I
abhor
them
24
That
is
why
I
said
to
you
You
will
take
possession
of
their
land
and
I
will
give
it
to
you
as
your
possession
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
Jehovah
your
God
I
am
who
has
set
you
apart
from
the
peoples
25
You
must
make
a
distinction
between
the
clean
animal
and
the
unclean
and
between
the
unclean
bird
and
the
clean
you
must
not
make
yourselves
loathsome
by
means
of
an
animal
or
a
bird
or
anything
that
creeps
on
the
ground
that
I
set
apart
for
you
to
regard
as
unclean
26
You
must
be
holy
to
me
because
I
Jehovah
am
holy
and
I
am
setting
you
apart
from
the
peoples
to
become
mine
27
Any
man
or
woman
who
acts
as
a
spirit
medium
or
is
a
fortune-teller
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
The
people
should
stone
them
to
death
Their
own
blood
is
upon
them
1
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
to
Moses
Talk
to
the
priests
Aarons
sons
and
say
to
them
No
one
should
defile
himself
for
a
dead
person
among
his
people
2
But
he
may
do
so
for
a
close
blood
relative
for
his
mother
his
father
his
son
his
daughter
his
brother
3
and
he
may
defile
himself
for
his
sister
if
she
is
a
virgin
who
is
near
to
him
and
has
not
yet
married
4
He
may
not
defile
himself
and
make
himself
profane
for
a
woman
who
belongs
to
a
husband
of
his
people
5
They
should
not
make
their
heads
bald
or
shave
off
the
fringe
of
their
beard
or
make
cuts
on
their
body
6
They
should
be
holy
to
their
God
and
they
should
not
profane
the
name
of
their
God
for
they
are
presenting
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
the
bread
of
their
God
and
they
must
be
holy
7
They
should
not
marry
a
prostitute
a
woman
who
has
been
defiled
or
a
woman
divorced
from
her
husband
because
the
priest
is
holy
to
his
God
8
You
must
sanctify
him
because
he
is
one
presenting
the
bread
of
your
God
He
should
be
holy
to
you
because
I
Jehovah
the
one
sanctifying
you
am
holy
9
Now
if
the
daughter
of
a
priest
should
profane
herself
by
committing
prostitution
she
is
profaning
her
father
She
should
be
burned
in
the
fire
10
The
high
priest
of
his
brothers
on
whose
head
the
anointing
oil
is
poured
and
who
has
been
installed
to
wear
the
priestly
garments
should
not
let
his
head
go
ungroomed
or
tear
his
garments
11
He
should
not
approach
any
dead
person
he
may
not
defile
himself
even
for
his
father
or
his
mother
12
He
should
not
go
out
from
the
sanctuary
and
should
not
profane
the
sanctuary
of
his
God
for
the
sign
of
dedication
the
anointing
oil
of
his
God
is
upon
him
I
am
Jehovah
13
He
must
take
as
a
wife
a
woman
who
is
a
virgin
14
He
may
not
marry
a
widow
a
divorced
woman
one
who
has
been
defiled
or
a
prostitute
but
he
should
take
a
virgin
from
his
people
as
a
wife
15
He
should
not
profane
his
offspring
among
his
people
for
I
am
Jehovah
who
is
sanctifying
him
16
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
17
Tell
Aaron
No
man
of
your
offspring
throughout
their
generations
who
has
a
defect
may
approach
to
present
the
bread
of
his
God
18
If
there
is
any
man
who
has
a
defect
he
may
not
approach
a
man
who
is
blind
or
lame
or
has
a
disfigured
face
or
one
limb
too
long
19
a
man
with
a
fractured
foot
or
a
fractured
hand
20
a
hunchback
or
a
dwarf
or
a
man
with
an
eye
defect
or
eczema
or
ringworm
or
damaged
testicles
21
No
man
of
the
offspring
of
Aaron
the
priest
who
has
a
defect
may
approach
to
present
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
Because
he
has
a
defect
he
may
not
approach
to
present
the
bread
of
his
God
22
He
may
eat
the
bread
of
his
God
from
the
most
holy
things
and
from
the
holy
things
23
However
he
may
not
come
near
the
curtain
and
he
may
not
approach
the
altar
because
there
is
a
defect
in
him
and
he
should
not
profane
my
sanctuary
for
I
am
Jehovah
who
is
sanctifying
them
24
So
Moses
spoke
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
and
all
the
Israelites
1
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
2
Tell
Aaron
and
his
sons
that
they
should
be
careful
how
they
handle
the
holy
things
of
the
Israelites
and
not
profane
my
holy
name
regarding
the
things
they
are
sanctifying
to
me
I
am
Jehovah
3
Say
to
them
Throughout
your
generations
any
of
your
offspring
who
while
he
is
unclean
comes
near
to
the
holy
things
that
the
Israelites
sanctify
to
Jehovah
that
person
will
be
cut
off
from
before
me
I
am
Jehovah
4
No
man
of
Aarons
offspring
who
has
leprosy
or
a
discharge
may
eat
of
the
holy
things
until
he
becomes
clean
neither
the
man
who
touches
someone
who
became
unclean
by
a
dead
person
nor
a
man
who
has
a
seminal
emission
5
nor
a
man
who
touches
an
unclean
swarming
creature
or
who
touches
a
man
who
is
unclean
for
any
reason
and
who
can
make
him
unclean
6
The
person
who
touches
any
of
these
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
and
may
not
eat
any
of
the
holy
things
but
he
should
bathe
himself
in
water
7
When
the
sun
has
set
he
will
be
clean
and
afterward
he
may
eat
some
of
the
holy
things
because
it
is
his
food
8
Also
he
should
not
eat
any
animal
found
dead
or
anything
torn
by
wild
animals
and
become
unclean
by
it
I
am
Jehovah
9
They
must
keep
their
obligation
to
me
so
that
they
may
not
incur
sin
because
of
it
and
have
to
die
for
it
because
they
were
profaning
it
I
am
Jehovah
who
is
sanctifying
them
10
No
unauthorized
person
may
eat
anything
holy
No
foreign
guest
of
a
priest
or
hired
worker
may
eat
anything
holy
11
But
if
a
priest
should
purchase
someone
with
his
own
money
that
person
may
share
in
eating
it
Slaves
born
in
his
house
may
also
share
in
eating
his
food
12
If
the
daughter
of
a
priest
should
marry
someone
who
is
not
a
priest
she
may
not
eat
of
the
contribution
of
the
holy
things
13
But
if
the
daughter
of
a
priest
should
become
a
widow
or
is
divorced
and
she
has
no
offspring
and
she
returns
to
her
fathers
house
as
in
her
youth
she
may
eat
some
of
her
fathers
food
but
no
unauthorized
person
may
eat
it
14
Now
if
a
man
eats
a
holy
thing
by
mistake
he
must
add
a
fifth
of
its
value
and
give
the
holy
offering
to
the
priest
15
So
they
should
not
profane
the
holy
things
of
the
Israelites
that
they
contribute
to
Jehovah
16
and
cause
themselves
to
incur
punishment
for
their
guilt
because
of
eating
their
holy
things
for
I
am
Jehovah
who
is
sanctifying
them
17
Jehovah
continued
speaking
to
Moses
saying
18
Speak
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
and
all
the
Israelites
and
say
to
them
When
an
Israelite
man
or
a
foreign
resident
in
Israel
presents
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
to
fulfill
his
vows
or
to
make
a
voluntary
offering
19
he
should
present
a
sound
male
from
the
herd
the
young
rams
or
the
goats
in
order
to
gain
approval
20
You
must
not
present
anything
with
a
defect
for
it
will
not
serve
to
gain
approval
for
you
21
If
a
man
presents
a
communion
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
to
pay
a
vow
or
as
a
voluntary
offering
it
should
be
a
sound
animal
from
the
herd
or
the
flock
in
order
to
gain
approval
No
defect
at
all
should
be
in
it
22
No
offering
should
be
blind
have
a
fracture
a
cut
a
wart
scabbiness
or
ringworm
you
must
not
present
any
of
these
to
Jehovah
or
make
such
an
offering
on
the
altar
for
Jehovah
23
You
may
present
a
bull
or
a
sheep
with
a
limb
that
is
too
long
or
too
short
as
a
voluntary
offering
but
it
will
not
be
accepted
with
approval
as
a
vow
offering
24
You
must
not
present
to
Jehovah
one
having
the
testicles
damaged
or
crushed
or
pulled
off
or
cut
off
and
you
should
not
offer
such
animals
in
your
land
25
And
you
must
not
present
any
of
these
from
the
hand
of
a
foreigner
as
the
bread
of
your
God
for
they
are
corrupted
and
defective
They
will
not
be
accepted
with
approval
for
you
26
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
27
When
a
bull
or
a
young
ram
or
a
goat
is
born
it
will
continue
with
its
mother
for
seven
days
but
from
the
eighth
day
forward
it
will
be
accepted
with
approval
as
an
offering
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
28
As
for
a
bull
or
a
sheep
you
must
not
slaughter
it
and
its
young
on
the
same
day
29
If
you
sacrifice
a
thanksgiving
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
you
should
sacrifice
it
to
gain
approval
for
yourselves
30
It
should
be
eaten
on
that
day
You
must
not
leave
any
of
it
until
morning
I
am
Jehovah
31
You
must
keep
my
commandments
and
carry
them
out
I
am
Jehovah
32
You
must
not
profane
my
holy
name
and
I
must
be
sanctified
in
the
midst
of
the
Israelites
I
am
Jehovah
who
is
sanctifying
you
33
the
one
bringing
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
to
prove
myself
God
to
you
I
am
Jehovah
1
Jehovah
continued
speaking
to
Moses
saying
2
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
The
seasonal
festivals
of
Jehovah
that
you
should
proclaim
are
holy
conventions
These
are
my
seasonal
festivals
3
Six
days
work
may
be
done
but
on
the
seventh
day
is
a
sabbath
of
complete
rest
a
holy
convention
You
may
not
do
any
sort
of
work
It
is
to
be
a
sabbath
to
Jehovah
wherever
you
dwell
4
These
are
the
seasonal
festivals
of
Jehovah
holy
conventions
that
you
should
proclaim
at
the
times
appointed
for
them
5
In
the
first
month
on
the
14th
day
of
the
month
at
twilight
is
the
Passover
to
Jehovah
6
On
the
15th
day
of
this
month
is
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
to
Jehovah
Seven
days
you
should
eat
unleavened
bread
7
On
the
first
day
you
will
observe
a
holy
convention
You
should
not
do
any
hard
work
8
But
you
are
to
present
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
for
seven
days
There
will
be
a
holy
convention
on
the
seventh
day
You
should
not
do
any
hard
work
9
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
10
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
When
you
eventually
come
into
the
land
that
I
am
giving
you
and
you
have
reaped
its
harvest
you
must
bring
a
sheaf
of
the
firstfruits
of
your
harvest
to
the
priest
11
And
he
will
wave
the
sheaf
back
and
forth
before
Jehovah
to
gain
approval
for
you
The
priest
should
wave
it
on
the
day
after
the
Sabbath
12
On
the
day
you
have
the
sheaf
waved
you
must
offer
a
sound
young
ram
in
its
first
year
as
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
13
Its
grain
offering
will
be
two
tenths
of
an
ephah
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
oil
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
a
pleasing
aroma
Its
drink
offering
will
be
a
fourth
of
a
hin
of
wine
14
You
must
not
eat
any
bread
roasted
grain
or
new
grain
until
this
day
until
you
bring
the
offering
of
your
God
It
is
a
lasting
statute
for
all
your
generations
wherever
you
dwell
15
You
are
to
count
seven
sabbaths
from
the
day
after
the
Sabbath
from
the
day
that
you
bring
the
sheaf
of
the
wave
offering
They
should
be
complete
weeks
16
You
will
count
off
50
days
until
the
day
after
the
seventh
Sabbath
and
then
you
should
present
a
new
grain
offering
to
Jehovah
17
You
should
bring
from
your
dwelling
places
two
loaves
as
a
wave
offering
These
should
be
made
of
two
tenths
of
an
ephah
of
fine
flour
They
should
be
baked
with
leaven
as
first
ripe
fruits
to
Jehovah
18
And
you
should
present
along
with
the
loaves
seven
sound
male
lambs
each
a
year
old
and
one
young
bull
and
two
rams
They
will
serve
as
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
along
with
the
corresponding
grain
offering
and
drink
offerings
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
of
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
19
And
you
must
offer
one
young
goat
as
a
sin
offering
and
two
male
lambs
each
a
year
old
as
a
communion
sacrifice
20
The
priest
will
wave
them
back
and
forth
along
with
the
loaves
of
the
first
ripe
fruits
as
a
wave
offering
before
Jehovah
together
with
the
two
male
lambs
They
should
serve
as
something
holy
to
Jehovah
for
the
priest
21
On
this
day
you
will
make
a
proclamation
for
a
holy
convention
for
yourselves
You
may
not
do
any
hard
work
It
is
a
lasting
statute
in
all
your
dwelling
places
for
all
your
generations
22
When
you
reap
the
harvest
of
your
land
you
must
not
reap
the
edge
of
your
field
completely
and
you
should
not
pick
up
what
is
left
from
your
harvest
You
should
leave
it
for
the
poor
and
for
the
foreign
resident
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
23
Jehovah
went
on
speaking
to
Moses
saying
24
Tell
the
Israelites
In
the
seventh
month
on
the
first
of
the
month
you
should
observe
a
complete
rest
a
memorial
signaled
by
a
trumpet
blast
a
holy
convention
25
You
may
not
do
any
hard
work
and
you
will
present
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
26
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
27
However
on
the
tenth
of
this
seventh
month
is
the
Day
of
Atonement
You
should
observe
a
holy
convention
and
you
must
afflict
yourselves
and
present
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
28
You
are
not
to
do
any
sort
of
work
on
this
particular
day
because
it
is
a
day
of
atonement
to
make
atonement
for
you
before
Jehovah
your
God
29
Anyone
who
will
not
afflict
himself
on
this
day
will
be
cut
off
from
his
people
30
And
I
will
destroy
from
among
his
people
every
person
who
does
any
sort
of
work
on
this
day
31
You
must
not
do
any
sort
of
work
It
is
a
lasting
statute
for
all
your
generations
wherever
you
dwell
32
It
is
a
sabbath
of
complete
rest
for
you
and
you
will
afflict
yourselves
on
the
ninth
of
the
month
in
the
evening
You
should
observe
your
sabbath
from
evening
to
evening
33
Jehovah
continued
speaking
to
Moses
saying
34
Tell
the
Israelites
On
the
15th
day
of
this
seventh
month
is
the
Festival
of
Booths
for
seven
days
to
Jehovah
35
There
is
to
be
a
holy
convention
on
the
first
day
and
you
should
not
do
any
hard
work
36
Seven
days
you
must
present
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
On
the
eighth
day
you
should
observe
a
holy
convention
and
you
should
present
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
It
is
a
solemn
assembly
You
may
not
do
any
hard
work
37
These
are
the
seasonal
festivals
of
Jehovah
that
you
should
proclaim
as
holy
conventions
for
presenting
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
the
burnt
offering
and
the
grain
offering
of
the
sacrifice
and
the
drink
offerings
according
to
the
daily
schedule
38
These
are
in
addition
to
what
is
offered
on
Jehovahs
sabbaths
and
your
gifts
your
vow
offerings
and
your
voluntary
offerings
which
you
should
give
to
Jehovah
39
However
on
the
15th
day
of
the
seventh
month
when
you
have
gathered
the
produce
of
the
land
you
should
celebrate
the
festival
of
Jehovah
for
seven
days
On
the
first
day
is
a
complete
rest
and
on
the
eighth
day
is
a
complete
rest
40
On
the
first
day
you
will
take
the
fruit
of
majestic
trees
the
fronds
of
palm
trees
the
branches
of
leafy
trees
and
poplars
of
the
valley
and
you
will
rejoice
before
Jehovah
your
God
for
seven
days
41
You
will
celebrate
it
as
a
festival
to
Jehovah
for
seven
days
in
the
year
As
a
lasting
statute
during
all
your
generations
you
should
celebrate
it
in
the
seventh
month
42
You
should
dwell
in
the
booths
for
seven
days
All
the
natives
in
Israel
should
dwell
in
the
booths
43
so
that
your
future
generations
may
know
that
it
was
in
the
booths
that
I
made
the
Israelites
dwell
when
I
was
bringing
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
44
So
Moses
spoke
of
the
seasonal
festivals
of
Jehovah
to
the
Israelites
1
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
2
Command
the
Israelites
to
bring
to
you
pure
beaten
olive
oil
for
the
lights
to
keep
the
lamps
lit
constantly
3
Outside
the
curtain
of
the
Testimony
in
the
tent
of
meeting
Aaron
should
arrange
to
keep
the
lamps
lit
from
evening
to
morning
before
Jehovah
constantly
It
is
a
permanent
statute
for
all
your
generations
4
He
should
set
the
lamps
in
order
on
the
lampstand
of
pure
gold
before
Jehovah
constantly
5
You
will
take
fine
flour
and
bake
it
into
12
ring-shaped
loaves
Two
tenths
of
an
ephah
should
go
into
each
loaf
6
You
will
place
them
in
two
sets
of
layers
six
to
the
layer
set
on
the
table
of
pure
gold
before
Jehovah
7
You
should
put
pure
frankincense
on
each
layer
set
and
it
will
serve
as
the
bread
for
a
token
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
8
On
each
Sabbath
day
he
should
regularly
arrange
it
before
Jehovah
It
is
a
lasting
covenant
with
the
Israelites
9
It
will
become
Aarons
and
his
sons
and
they
will
eat
it
in
a
holy
place
because
it
is
something
most
holy
for
him
from
Jehovahs
offerings
made
by
fire
as
a
lasting
regulation
10
Now
among
the
Israelites
was
a
son
of
an
Israelite
woman
and
an
Egyptian
man
and
a
fight
broke
out
between
him
and
an
Israelite
man
in
the
camp
11
The
son
of
the
Israelite
woman
began
to
abuse
the
Name
and
to
curse
it
So
they
brought
him
to
Moses
Incidentally
his
mother
was
Shelomith
the
daughter
of
Dibri
of
the
tribe
of
Dan
12
They
placed
him
in
custody
until
Jehovahs
decision
was
made
clear
to
them
13
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
14
Bring
the
one
who
cursed
to
the
outside
of
the
camp
and
all
those
who
heard
him
must
lay
their
hands
on
his
head
and
then
the
entire
assembly
must
stone
him
15
And
you
should
tell
the
Israelites
If
any
man
curses
his
God
he
will
answer
for
his
sin
16
So
the
abuser
of
Jehovahs
name
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
The
entire
assembly
should
stone
him
without
fail
The
foreign
resident
should
be
put
to
death
the
same
as
the
native
for
his
abusing
the
Name
17
If
a
man
takes
a
human
life
he
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
18
Anyone
who
strikes
and
kills
a
domestic
animal
should
make
compensation
for
it
life
for
life
19
If
a
man
injures
his
fellow
man
then
what
he
has
done
should
be
done
to
him
20
Fracture
for
fracture
eye
for
eye
tooth
for
tooth
the
same
sort
of
injury
he
inflicted
should
be
inflicted
on
him
21
The
man
who
strikes
and
kills
an
animal
should
make
compensation
for
it
but
the
one
who
strikes
and
kills
a
man
should
be
put
to
death
22
One
judicial
decision
will
apply
for
you
whether
a
foreign
resident
or
a
native
because
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
23
Moses
then
spoke
to
the
Israelites
and
they
brought
the
one
who
uttered
the
curse
to
the
outside
of
the
camp
and
they
stoned
him
Thus
the
Israelites
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
1
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
on
Mount
Sinai
saying
2
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
When
you
eventually
come
into
the
land
that
I
am
giving
you
then
the
land
will
observe
a
sabbath
to
Jehovah
3
Six
years
you
should
sow
your
field
with
seed
and
six
years
you
should
prune
your
vineyard
and
you
will
gather
the
lands
produce
4
But
in
the
seventh
year
there
should
be
a
sabbath
of
complete
rest
for
the
land
a
sabbath
to
Jehovah
You
should
not
sow
your
field
with
seed
or
prune
your
vineyard
5
You
must
not
reap
what
grows
on
its
own
from
the
grain
left
after
the
harvest
and
the
grapes
of
your
unpruned
vine
you
must
not
gather
There
should
be
a
year
of
complete
rest
for
the
land
6
However
you
may
eat
the
food
that
grows
in
the
land
during
its
sabbath
you
your
male
and
female
slaves
your
hired
worker
and
the
foreign
settlers
who
are
residing
with
you
may
eat
it
7
as
well
as
the
domestic
and
the
wild
animals
in
your
land
Everything
the
land
produces
may
be
eaten
8
You
will
count
off
seven
sabbath
years
seven
times
seven
years
and
the
days
of
the
seven
sabbath
years
will
amount
to
49
years
9
You
will
then
sound
the
horn
loudly
in
the
seventh
month
on
the
tenth
of
the
month
on
the
Day
of
Atonement
you
should
cause
the
sound
of
the
horn
to
be
heard
in
all
your
land
10
You
must
sanctify
the
50th
year
and
proclaim
liberty
in
the
land
to
all
its
inhabitants
It
will
become
a
Jubilee
for
you
and
each
of
you
will
return
to
his
property
and
each
of
you
should
return
to
his
family
11
A
Jubilee
is
what
that
50th
year
will
become
for
you
You
will
not
sow
seed
or
reap
what
grew
on
its
own
from
leftover
grain
nor
gather
the
grapes
of
unpruned
vines
12
For
it
is
a
Jubilee
It
is
to
be
holy
to
you
You
may
eat
only
what
the
land
produces
by
itself
13
In
this
year
of
the
Jubilee
each
of
you
should
return
to
his
property
14
If
you
sell
anything
to
your
fellow
man
or
if
you
buy
from
him
do
not
exploit
one
another
15
You
should
buy
from
your
fellow
man
taking
into
account
the
number
of
the
years
after
the
Jubilee
and
he
should
sell
to
you
according
to
the
remaining
years
for
crops
16
If
there
are
many
years
remaining
he
may
increase
its
purchase
price
and
when
there
are
few
years
left
he
should
reduce
its
purchase
price
because
he
is
selling
you
the
number
of
crops
to
be
produced
17
No
one
among
you
should
exploit
his
fellow
man
and
you
must
be
in
fear
of
your
God
for
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
18
By
your
carrying
out
my
statutes
and
keeping
my
judicial
decisions
you
will
dwell
in
security
in
the
land
19
The
land
will
give
its
fruitage
and
you
will
eat
to
satisfaction
and
dwell
there
in
security
20
But
if
you
should
say
What
will
we
eat
in
the
seventh
year
if
we
may
not
sow
seed
or
gather
our
crops
21
I
will
command
my
blessing
for
you
in
the
sixth
year
and
the
land
will
yield
a
crop
sufficient
for
three
years
22
Then
you
will
sow
seed
in
the
eighth
year
and
eat
from
the
old
crop
until
the
ninth
year
Until
its
crop
arrives
you
will
eat
from
the
old
23
The
land
should
not
be
sold
on
a
permanent
basis
because
the
land
is
mine
For
you
are
foreign
residents
and
settlers
from
my
standpoint
24
Throughout
the
land
of
your
possession
you
should
grant
the
right
of
buying
back
the
land
25
If
your
brother
becomes
poor
and
has
to
sell
some
of
his
property
a
repurchaser
who
is
closely
related
to
him
must
come
and
buy
back
what
his
brother
sold
26
If
anyone
has
no
repurchaser
but
he
becomes
prosperous
and
finds
the
means
to
repurchase
it
27
he
should
calculate
its
value
for
the
years
since
he
sold
it
and
refund
the
difference
to
the
man
whom
he
sold
it
to
Then
he
may
return
to
his
property
28
But
if
he
does
not
find
the
means
to
get
it
back
from
him
what
he
sold
will
remain
with
the
purchaser
until
the
Jubilee
year
and
it
will
revert
to
him
in
the
Jubilee
and
he
will
return
to
his
property
29
Now
if
a
man
should
sell
a
home
in
a
walled
city
his
right
of
repurchase
will
also
continue
until
the
end
of
the
year
from
the
time
of
his
completing
the
sale
his
right
of
repurchase
will
be
valid
a
whole
year
30
But
if
it
is
not
bought
back
by
the
end
of
one
full
year
the
house
within
the
walled
city
will
become
the
permanent
property
of
its
purchaser
throughout
his
generations
It
should
not
be
released
in
the
Jubilee
31
However
the
houses
of
settlements
with
no
surrounding
wall
should
be
considered
to
be
part
of
the
field
of
the
countryside
The
right
of
repurchase
should
continue
for
it
and
it
should
be
released
in
the
Jubilee
32
As
for
the
houses
of
the
Levites
within
their
cities
the
Levites
will
have
the
permanent
right
to
repurchase
them
33
When
the
property
of
the
Levites
is
not
bought
back
the
house
sold
in
the
city
belonging
to
them
will
also
be
released
in
the
Jubilee
because
the
houses
of
the
cities
of
the
Levites
are
their
property
among
the
Israelites
34
Moreover
the
field
of
pasture
ground
surrounding
their
cities
may
not
be
sold
for
it
is
their
permanent
possession
35
If
your
brother
who
is
nearby
becomes
poor
and
cannot
support
himself
you
must
sustain
him
as
you
would
a
foreign
resident
and
a
settler
so
that
he
may
keep
alive
with
you
36
Do
not
take
interest
or
make
a
profit
from
him
You
must
be
in
fear
of
your
God
and
your
brother
will
keep
alive
with
you
37
You
must
not
lend
him
your
money
on
interest
or
give
out
your
food
for
profit
38
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
to
give
you
the
land
of
Canaan
to
prove
myself
your
God
39
If
your
brother
who
lives
nearby
becomes
poor
and
he
has
to
sell
himself
to
you
you
must
not
force
him
to
do
slave
labor
40
He
should
be
treated
like
a
hired
worker
like
a
settler
He
should
serve
with
you
until
the
Jubilee
year
41
Then
he
will
leave
you
he
and
his
children
with
him
and
return
to
his
family
He
should
return
to
the
property
of
his
forefathers
42
For
they
are
my
slaves
whom
I
brought
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
They
should
not
sell
themselves
the
way
a
slave
is
sold
43
You
must
not
treat
him
cruelly
and
you
must
be
in
fear
of
your
God
44
Your
male
and
female
slaves
are
to
come
from
the
nations
around
you
from
them
you
may
buy
a
male
or
a
female
slave
45
Also
from
the
sons
of
the
foreign
settlers
who
are
residing
with
you
from
them
and
from
their
families
that
are
born
to
them
in
your
land
you
may
buy
slaves
and
they
will
become
your
possession
46
You
may
pass
them
on
as
an
inheritance
to
your
sons
after
you
to
inherit
as
a
permanent
possession
You
may
use
them
as
workers
but
you
must
not
subject
your
Israelite
brothers
to
cruel
treatment
47
But
if
a
foreign
resident
or
a
settler
among
you
becomes
wealthy
and
your
brother
has
become
poor
alongside
him
and
must
sell
himself
to
the
foreign
resident
or
the
settler
who
lives
among
you
or
to
a
member
of
the
family
of
the
foreign
resident
48
he
will
continue
to
have
the
right
of
repurchase
after
he
has
sold
himself
One
of
his
brothers
may
buy
him
back
49
or
his
uncle
or
the
son
of
his
uncle
may
buy
him
back
or
any
close
relative
one
of
his
family
may
buy
him
back
Or
if
he
himself
has
become
wealthy
he
may
also
buy
himself
back
50
He
should
calculate
with
his
purchaser
the
time
from
the
year
he
sold
himself
to
him
until
the
Jubilee
year
and
the
money
of
his
sale
will
correspond
to
the
number
of
years
His
workdays
during
that
time
will
be
assessed
at
the
rate
of
a
hired
worker
51
If
there
are
many
years
remaining
he
should
pay
his
repurchase
price
in
proportion
to
the
years
that
are
left
52
But
if
only
a
few
years
remain
until
the
Jubilee
year
he
should
then
calculate
for
himself
and
pay
his
repurchase
price
in
proportion
to
the
years
remaining
53
He
should
continue
to
serve
him
year
by
year
as
a
hired
worker
and
you
should
see
to
it
that
he
does
not
treat
him
cruelly
54
However
if
he
cannot
buy
himself
back
on
these
terms
he
will
then
go
free
in
the
year
of
Jubilee
he
and
his
children
with
him
55
For
the
Israelites
are
my
own
slaves
They
are
my
slaves
whom
I
brought
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
1
You
must
not
make
worthless
gods
for
yourselves
and
you
must
not
set
up
a
carved
image
or
a
sacred
pillar
for
yourselves
and
you
must
not
put
a
stone
figure
in
your
land
in
order
to
bow
down
toward
it
for
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
2
You
should
keep
my
sabbaths
and
show
reverence
for
my
sanctuary
I
am
Jehovah
3
If
you
continue
walking
in
my
statutes
and
keeping
my
commandments
and
you
carry
them
out
4
I
will
give
you
showers
of
rain
at
their
proper
time
and
the
land
will
yield
its
produce
and
the
trees
of
the
field
will
give
their
fruit
5
Your
threshing
season
will
extend
until
your
grape
harvest
and
the
grape
harvest
will
extend
until
the
sowing
season
and
you
will
eat
your
bread
to
satisfaction
and
dwell
in
security
in
your
land
6
I
will
put
peace
in
the
land
and
you
will
lie
down
with
no
one
making
you
afraid
and
I
will
rid
the
land
of
vicious
wild
animals
and
a
sword
of
war
will
not
pass
through
your
land
7
You
will
certainly
pursue
your
enemies
and
they
will
fall
before
you
by
the
sword
8
Five
of
you
will
pursue
100
and
100
of
you
will
pursue
10000
and
your
enemies
will
fall
before
you
by
the
sword
9
I
will
direct
my
favor
to
you
and
make
you
fruitful
and
multiply
you
and
I
will
keep
my
covenant
with
you
10
While
you
are
still
eating
the
old
produce
of
the
preceding
year
you
will
need
to
clear
out
the
old
to
make
way
for
the
new
11
And
I
will
place
my
tabernacle
in
your
midst
and
I
will
not
reject
you
12
I
will
walk
among
you
and
be
your
God
and
you
for
your
part
will
be
my
people
13
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
to
be
their
slaves
no
longer
and
I
broke
the
bars
of
your
yoke
and
made
you
walk
with
heads
held
high
14
However
if
you
will
not
listen
to
me
or
keep
all
these
commandments
15
and
if
you
reject
my
statutes
and
if
you
abhor
my
judicial
decisions
so
that
you
do
not
keep
all
my
commandments
and
you
violate
my
covenant
16
I
for
my
part
will
do
the
following
to
you
I
will
punish
you
with
distress
with
tuberculosis
and
burning
fever
making
your
eyes
fail
and
your
life
waste
away
You
will
sow
your
seed
simply
for
nothing
for
your
enemies
will
eat
it
17
I
will
set
my
face
against
you
and
you
will
be
defeated
by
your
enemies
and
those
who
hate
you
will
tread
on
you
and
you
will
flee
when
no
one
is
pursuing
you
18
If
even
this
does
not
make
you
listen
to
me
I
will
have
to
chastise
you
seven
times
as
much
for
your
sins
19
I
will
break
your
stubborn
pride
and
make
your
heavens
like
iron
and
your
earth
like
copper
20
You
will
exhaust
your
strength
for
nothing
as
your
land
will
not
yield
its
produce
and
the
trees
of
the
land
will
not
produce
fruit
21
But
if
you
keep
walking
in
opposition
to
me
and
refuse
to
listen
to
me
I
will
then
have
to
strike
you
seven
times
as
much
according
to
your
sins
22
I
will
send
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
among
you
and
they
will
bereave
you
of
children
and
annihilate
your
domestic
animals
and
reduce
your
numbers
and
your
roads
will
be
deserted
23
If
in
spite
of
these
things
you
do
not
accept
my
correction
and
you
insist
on
walking
in
opposition
to
me
24
then
I
too
will
walk
in
opposition
to
you
and
I
myself
will
strike
you
seven
times
for
your
sins
25
I
will
bring
an
avenging
sword
upon
you
for
breaking
the
covenant
If
you
gather
yourselves
into
your
cities
I
will
send
disease
into
your
midst
and
you
will
be
given
into
the
hand
of
an
enemy
26
When
I
destroy
your
supply
of
bread
ten
women
will
be
able
to
bake
your
bread
in
only
one
oven
and
then
ration
your
bread
by
weight
and
you
will
eat
but
you
will
not
be
satisfied
27
If
in
spite
of
this
you
will
not
listen
to
me
and
you
insist
on
walking
in
opposition
to
me
28
I
will
intensify
my
opposition
to
you
and
I
myself
will
have
to
chastise
you
seven
times
for
your
sins
29
So
you
will
have
to
eat
the
flesh
of
your
sons
and
you
will
eat
the
flesh
of
your
daughters
30
I
will
annihilate
your
sacred
high
places
and
cut
down
your
incense
stands
and
pile
your
carcasses
on
the
carcasses
of
your
disgusting
idols
and
I
will
turn
away
from
you
in
disgust
31
I
will
give
your
cities
to
the
sword
and
make
your
sanctuaries
desolate
and
I
will
not
smell
the
pleasing
aromas
of
your
sacrifices
32
I
myself
will
make
the
land
desolate
and
your
enemies
who
are
dwelling
in
it
will
stare
in
amazement
over
it
33
And
I
will
scatter
you
among
the
nations
and
I
will
unsheathe
a
sword
after
you
and
your
land
will
be
made
desolate
and
your
cities
will
be
devastated
34
At
that
time
the
land
will
pay
off
its
sabbaths
all
the
days
it
lies
desolate
while
you
are
in
the
land
of
your
enemies
At
that
time
the
land
will
rest
as
it
must
repay
its
sabbaths
35
All
the
days
it
lies
desolate
it
will
rest
because
it
did
not
rest
during
your
sabbaths
when
you
were
dwelling
on
it
36
As
for
those
who
survive
I
will
fill
their
hearts
with
despair
in
the
lands
of
their
enemies
and
the
sound
of
a
blowing
leaf
will
cause
them
to
flee
and
they
will
flee
like
someone
running
from
the
sword
and
fall
without
anyone
pursuing
them
37
They
will
stumble
over
one
another
like
those
running
from
a
sword
though
no
one
is
pursuing
them
You
will
not
be
able
to
resist
your
enemies
38
You
will
perish
among
the
nations
and
the
land
of
your
enemies
will
consume
you
39
Those
of
you
who
remain
will
be
left
to
rot
in
the
lands
of
your
enemies
because
of
your
error
Yes
they
will
rot
away
because
of
the
errors
of
their
fathers
40
Then
they
will
confess
their
own
error
and
the
error
and
unfaithfulness
of
their
fathers
and
admit
that
they
behaved
unfaithfully
by
walking
in
opposition
to
me
41
Then
I
also
walked
in
opposition
to
them
by
bringing
them
into
the
land
of
their
enemies
Perhaps
then
their
uncircumcised
heart
will
be
humbled
and
then
they
will
pay
off
their
error
42
And
I
will
remember
my
covenant
with
Jacob
and
my
covenant
with
Isaac
and
I
will
remember
my
covenant
with
Abraham
and
I
will
remember
the
land
43
While
the
land
was
abandoned
by
them
it
was
paying
off
its
sabbaths
and
lying
desolate
without
them
and
they
were
paying
for
their
error
because
they
rejected
my
judicial
decisions
and
they
abhorred
my
statutes
44
But
despite
all
of
this
while
they
are
in
the
land
of
their
enemies
I
will
never
completely
reject
them
nor
cast
them
away
to
the
point
of
exterminating
them
which
would
violate
my
covenant
with
them
for
I
am
Jehovah
their
God
45
For
their
sakes
I
will
remember
the
covenant
with
their
ancestors
whom
I
brought
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
under
the
eyes
of
the
nations
in
order
to
prove
myself
their
God
I
am
Jehovah
46
These
are
the
regulations
the
judicial
decisions
and
the
laws
that
Jehovah
established
between
himself
and
the
Israelites
on
Mount
Sinai
through
Moses
1
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
2
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
If
a
man
makes
a
special
vow
to
offer
the
estimated
value
of
a
person
to
Jehovah
3
the
estimated
value
of
a
male
from
20
to
60
years
old
will
be
50
shekels
of
silver
by
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
4
But
if
it
is
a
female
the
estimated
value
will
be
30
shekels
5
If
the
age
is
from
5
to
20
years
old
the
estimated
value
of
the
male
will
be
20
shekels
and
10
shekels
for
the
female
6
If
the
age
is
from
one
month
up
to
five
years
old
the
estimated
value
of
the
male
will
be
five
shekels
of
silver
and
three
shekels
of
silver
for
the
female
7
If
the
age
is
60
years
and
over
the
estimated
value
will
be
15
shekels
for
the
male
and
10
shekels
for
the
female
8
But
if
he
is
too
poor
to
pay
the
estimated
value
the
person
will
stand
before
the
priest
and
the
priest
will
set
a
value
on
him
The
priest
will
make
the
valuation
according
to
what
the
one
making
the
vow
can
afford
9
If
the
vow
involves
an
animal
that
is
suitable
for
offering
to
Jehovah
whatever
may
be
given
to
Jehovah
will
become
something
holy
10
He
may
not
replace
it
or
exchange
it
with
good
for
bad
or
with
bad
for
good
But
if
he
should
exchange
it
with
one
animal
for
another
animal
the
original
and
what
is
exchanged
for
it
will
both
become
holy
11
If
it
is
an
unclean
animal
that
may
not
be
presented
as
an
offering
to
Jehovah
he
will
then
stand
the
animal
before
the
priest
12
The
priest
will
then
set
its
value
as
to
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
The
value
estimated
by
the
priest
will
stand
13
But
if
he
ever
wants
to
buy
it
back
he
must
then
give
a
fifth
of
it
in
addition
to
the
estimated
value
14
Now
if
a
man
should
sanctify
his
house
as
something
holy
to
Jehovah
the
priest
will
then
set
its
value
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
According
to
the
value
that
the
priest
sets
that
is
what
it
will
cost
15
But
if
the
one
who
sanctifies
his
house
wants
to
buy
it
back
he
must
then
give
a
fifth
of
the
money
of
the
estimated
value
in
addition
to
it
and
it
will
become
his
16
If
a
man
sanctifies
to
Jehovah
some
of
the
field
that
he
possesses
the
value
will
be
estimated
in
proportion
to
the
seed
needed
to
sow
it
a
homer
of
barley
seed
will
be
50
shekels
of
silver
17
If
he
sanctifies
his
field
from
the
year
of
Jubilee
the
estimated
value
stands
18
If
he
sanctifies
his
field
after
the
Jubilee
the
priest
will
calculate
for
him
the
price
in
proportion
to
the
years
that
are
left
until
the
next
year
of
Jubilee
and
a
deduction
should
be
made
from
the
estimated
value
19
But
if
the
one
who
sanctified
it
should
ever
buy
the
field
back
he
must
then
give
a
fifth
of
the
money
of
the
estimated
value
in
addition
to
it
and
it
will
remain
his
20
Now
if
he
should
not
buy
the
field
back
and
the
field
is
sold
to
another
man
it
may
not
be
bought
back
again
21
When
the
field
is
released
in
the
Jubilee
it
will
become
something
holy
to
Jehovah
as
a
field
that
is
devoted
to
him
It
will
become
the
property
of
the
priests
22
If
a
man
sanctifies
to
Jehovah
a
field
he
purchased
that
is
not
part
of
his
hereditary
property
23
the
priest
will
calculate
for
him
the
amount
of
the
valuation
up
until
the
year
of
Jubilee
and
he
will
give
the
estimated
value
on
that
day
It
is
something
holy
to
Jehovah
24
In
the
year
of
Jubilee
the
field
will
return
to
the
one
he
bought
it
from
to
the
one
the
land
belongs
to
25
Every
value
should
be
estimated
by
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
The
shekel
should
amount
to
20
gerahs
26
However
no
one
should
sanctify
the
firstborn
of
the
animals
since
it
is
born
as
the
firstborn
for
Jehovah
Whether
bull
or
sheep
it
already
belongs
to
Jehovah
27
If
it
is
among
the
unclean
animals
and
he
redeems
it
according
to
the
estimated
value
he
should
give
a
fifth
of
it
in
addition
to
it
But
if
it
is
not
bought
back
it
will
be
sold
according
to
the
estimated
value
28
But
no
devoted
thing
that
a
man
devotes
unconditionally
to
Jehovah
from
his
belongings
may
be
sold
or
bought
back
whether
from
mankind
or
animals
or
the
field
he
possesses
Every
devoted
thing
is
something
most
holy
to
Jehovah
29
Furthermore
no
condemned
person
who
is
set
apart
for
destruction
may
be
redeemed
He
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
30
Every
tenth
part
of
the
land
whether
from
the
produce
of
the
field
or
the
fruit
of
the
trees
belongs
to
Jehovah
It
is
something
holy
to
Jehovah
31
If
a
man
ever
wants
to
buy
any
of
his
tenth
part
back
he
should
give
a
fifth
of
it
in
addition
to
it
32
As
for
every
tenth
part
of
the
herd
and
flock
everything
that
passes
under
the
shepherds
staff
the
tenth
animal
should
become
something
holy
to
Jehovah
33
He
should
not
examine
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
neither
should
he
exchange
it
But
if
he
would
ever
try
to
exchange
it
both
the
original
and
what
is
exchanged
for
it
should
become
something
holy
It
may
not
be
bought
back
34
These
are
the
commandments
that
Jehovah
gave
to
Moses
for
the
Israelites
on
Mount
Sinai
1
And
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
in
the
tent
of

on
the
first
day
of
the
second
month
in
the

year
of
their
coming
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
He
said
2

to
their
families

the
count
of
the
names
of

3
You

their
companies
all
those

4
Take
with
you
one
man
from
each
tribe

one
is
to
be
a
head
of
his
paternal
house
5
These
are

of

men
who
will

you

47
But
the
Levites
were
not
registered
in
among
them
by
the
tribe
of
their
fathers
48
So
Jehovah
told
Moses
49
Only
the
tribe
of
Levi
you
are
not
to
register
and
you
should
not
include
the
number
of
them
along
with
the
other
Israelites
50
You
should
appoint
the
Levites
over
the
tabernacle
of
the
Testimony
and
over
all
its
utensils
and
over
everything
that
belongs
to
it
They
will
carry
the
tabernacle
and
all
its
utensils
and
they
will
minister
at
it
and
they
are
to
camp
around
the
tabernacle
51
Whenever

is

be
moved
the

should
take
it
down

when

reassembled
the
Levites
should
set
it
up
and
any
unauthorized
person
who
comes
near
should
be
put
to
death
52
Each
Israelite
should
set
up
his
tent
in
his
assigned
camp
each
man
according
to
his
three-tribe
division
by
their
companies
53
And
the
Levites
should
encamp
around
the
tabernacle
of
the
Testimony
so
that
no
indignation
may
arise
against
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
and
the
Levites
must
be
responsible
for
the
care
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
Testimony
54
The
people
of
Israel
did
all
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
They
did
just
so
1
Jehovah
now
spoke
to
Moses
and
Aaron
saying
2
The
Israelites
should
encamp
where
their
three-tribe
division
is
assigned
each
man
near
the

house
They

33
But
the

get

just
as

34
The
Israelites
did
everything
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
This
is
how
they
encamped
by
their
three-tribe
divisions
and
how
they
broke
camp
each

family
and
according
to
their

1
Now
these
were
the
family
lines
of
Aaron
and
Moses
in
the
day
that
Jehovah
spoke
with
Moses
on
Mount
Sinai
2
These
were
the
names
of
Aarons
sons
the
firstborn
Nadab
and
Abihu
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
3
These
were
the
names
of
Aarons
sons
the
anointed
priests
who
had
been
installed
to
serve
as
priests
4
However
Nadab
and
Abihu
died
before
Jehovah
when
they
offered
unauthorized
fire
before
Jehovah
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
and
they
did
not
have
any
sons
But
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
continued
to
serve
as
priests
along
with
Aaron
their
father
5
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
6
Bring
the
tribe
of
Levi
forward
and
stand
them
before
Aaron
the
priest
and
they
will
minister
to
him
7
They
are
to
fulfill
their
responsibilities
toward
him
and
toward
all
the
assembly
before
the
tent
of
meeting
by
carrying
out
their
service
in
connection
with
the
tabernacle
8
They
are
to
take
care
of
all
the
utensils
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
to
carry
out
their
responsibilities
toward
the
Israelites
by
taking
care
of
the
services
related
to
the
tabernacle
9
You
are
to
give
the
Levites
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
They
are
given
ones
given
to
him
from
the
Israelites
10
You
should
appoint
Aaron
and
his
sons
and
they
are
to
carry
out
their
priestly
duties
and
any
unauthorized
person
who
comes
near
should
be
put
to
death
11
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
12
As
for
me
look
I
take
the
Levites
from
among
the
Israelites
in
place
of
all
the
firstborn
of
the
Israelites
and
the
Levites
will
become
mine
13
For
every
firstborn
is
mine
In
the
day
that
I
struck
every
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt
I
sanctified
to
myself
every
firstborn
in
Israel
from
man
to
beast
They
are
to
become
mine
I
am
Jehovah
14
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
saying
15
Register
the
sons
of
Levi
by
their
paternal
houses
and
by
their
families
You
should
register
every
male
from
a
month
old
and
up
16
So
Moses
registered
them
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
just
as
he
had
been
commanded
17
These
were
the
names
of
the
sons
of
Levi
Gershon
Kohath
and
Merari
18
Now
these
were
the
names
of
the
sons
of
Gershon
by
their
families
Libni
and
Shimei
19
The

of
Kohath
by
their
families
were
Amram
Izhar
Hebron
and
Uzziel
20
The
sons
of
Merari
by
their
families
were
Mahli
and
Mushi
These
were
the
families
of
the
Levites
by
their
paternal
houses
21
From
Gershon
came
the
family
of
the
Libnites
and
the
family
of
the
Shimeites
These
were
the
families
of
the
Gershonites
22
The
number
of
all
their
males
a
month
old
and
up
who
were
registered
was
7500
23
The
families
of
the
Gershonites
were
encamped
behind
the
tabernacle
toward
the
west
24
The
chieftain
of
the
paternal
house
of
the
Gershonites
was
Eliasaph
the
son
of
Lael
25
The
responsibility
of
the
sons
of
Gershon
in
the
tent
of
meeting
was
to
care
for
the
tabernacle
and
the
tent
its
covering
the
screen
of
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
26
the
hanging
curtains
of
the
courtyard
the
screen
of
the
entrance
of
the
courtyard
that
surrounds
the
tabernacle
and
the
altar
its
tent
cords
and
all
the
service
connected
with
these
27
From
Kohath
came
the
family
of
the
Amramites
the
family
of
the
Izharites
the
family
of
the
Hebronites
and
the
family
of
the
Uzzielites
These
were
the
families
of
the
Kohathites
28
The
number
of
all
the
males
from
a
month
old
and
up
was
8600
they
were
responsible
for
taking
care
of
the
holy
place
29
The
families
of
the
sons
of
Kohath
camped
on
the
south
side
of
the
tabernacle
30
The
chieftain
of
the
paternal
house
of
the
families
of
the
Kohathites
was
Elizaphan
the
son
of
Uzziel
31
Their
responsibility
was
to
care
for
the
Ark
the

the
lampstand
the
altars
the
utensils
used
to
minister
in
the
holy
place
the
screen
and
all
the
service
connected
with
these
32
The
head
chieftain
of
the
Levites
was
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest
who
had
the
oversight
of
those
taking
care
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
holy
place
33
From
Merari
came
the
family
of
the
Mahlites
and
the
family
of
the
Mushites
These
were
the
families
of
Merari
34
The
number
of
all
the
males
from
a
month
old
and
up
who
were
registered
was
6200
35
The
chieftain
of
the
paternal
house
of
the
families
of
Merari
was
Zuriel
the
son
of
Abihail
They
were
encamped
on
the
north
side
of
the
tabernacle
36
The
sons
of
Merari
were
responsible
for
overseeing
the
panel
frames
of
the
tabernacle
its
bars
its
pillars
its
socket
pedestals
all
its
utensils
and
all
the
service
connected
with
these
37
as
well
as
the
pillars
that
were
all
around
the
courtyard
and
their
socket
pedestals
their
tent
pins
and
their
tent
cords
38
Those
camping
in
front
of
the
tabernacle
toward
the
east
before
the
tent
of
meeting
toward
the
sunrise
were
Moses
and
Aaron
and
his
sons
They
were
responsible
for
taking
care
of
the
sanctuary
as
their
obligation
in
behalf
of
the
Israelites
Any
unauthorized
person
coming
near
would
be
put
to
death
39
All
the
Levite
males
from
a
month
old
and
up
whom
Moses
and
Aaron
registered
by
their
families
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
were
22000
40
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Register
all
the
firstborn
males
of
the
Israelites
from
a
month
old
and
up
count
them
and
make
a
list
of
their
names
41
You
must
take
the
Levites
for
me—I
am
Jehovah—in
place
of
all
the
firstborn
of
the
Israelites
and
take
the
domestic
animals
of
the
Levites
in
place
of
all
the
firstborn
of
the
domestic
animals
of
the
Israelites
42
Moses
then
registered
all
the
firstborn
among
the
Israelites
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
43
The
number
of
all
the
firstborn
males
who
were
registered
by
name
from
a
month
old
and
up
was
22273
44
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
45
Take
the
Levites
in
place
of
all
the
firstborn
among
the
Israelites
and
take
the
domestic
animals
of
the
Levites
in
place
of
their
domestic
animals
and
the
Levites
must
become
mine
I
am
Jehovah
46
As
the
ransom
price
of
the
273
of
the
firstborn
of
the
Israelites
who
are
in
excess
of
the
Levites
47
you
are
to
take
five
shekels
for
each
individual
according
to
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
A
shekel
is
20
gerahs
48
You
are
to
give
the
money
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
as
the
ransom
price
of
those
who
are
in
excess
of
them
49
So
Moses
took
the
money
of
the
redemption
price
from
those
who
were
in
excess
of
the
ransom
price
of
the
Levites
50
He
took
the
money
from
the
firstborn
of
the
Israelites
1365
shekels
according
to
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
51
Then
Moses
gave
the
money
of
the
ransom
price
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
according
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
1
Jehovah
now
spoke
to
Moses
and
Aaron
saying
2
A
census
should
be
taken
of
the
sons
of
Kohath
from
among
the
sons
of
Levi
by
their
families

houses
3
all
those

30
to

years
old
who
are
in

in
the
tent
of
meeting
4
This
is
the
service
of
the
sons
of
Kohath
in
the
tent
of
meeting
It
is
something
most
holy
5
Aaron
and
his
sons
will
come
in
when
the
camp
is
departing
and
take
down
the
screening
curtain
and
cover
the
ark
of
the
Testimony
with
it
6
They
will
put
a
sealskin
covering
over
it
and
spread
out
a
solid
blue
cloth
over
it
and
put
its
carrying
poles
in
place
7
They
will
also
spread
out
a
blue
cloth
over
the
table
of
showbread
and
they
will
put
on
it
the
dishes
the
cups
the

and
the

along
with
its
lamps
its
snuffers
its
fire
holders
and
all
its
containers
for
oil
that
are
used
to
maintain
it
10
They
will
wrap
it
and
all
its
utensils
in
a
sealskin
covering
and
put
it
on
a
carrying
bar
11
And
they
will
spread
out
a
blue
cloth
over
the
golden
altar
cover
it
with
a
sealskin
covering
and
put
its
carrying
poles
in
place
12
They
will
then
take
all
the
utensils
of
the
ministry
with
which
they
regularly
minister
in
the
holy
place
and
put
them
in
a
blue
cloth
and
cover
them
with
a
sealskin
covering
and
put
them
on
a
carrying
bar
13
They
should
remove
the
ashes
from
the
altar
and
spread
out
a
cloth
of
purple
wool
over
it
14
They
will
put
on
it
all
its
utensils
that
are
used
when
they
minister
at
the
altar
the
fire
holders
the
forks
the
shovels
and
the
bowls
all
the
utensils
of
the
altar
and
they
are
to
spread
a
sealskin
covering
over
it
and
put
its
carrying
poles
in
place
15
Aaron
and
his
sons
must
finish
covering
the
holy
place
and
all
the
utensils
of
the
holy
place
when
the
camp
is
departing
Then
the
sons
of
Kohath
will
come
in
to
carry
them
but
they
must
not
touch
the
holy
place
or
they
will
die
These
things
are
the
responsibility
of
the
sons
of
Kohath
in
connection
with
the
tent
of
meeting
16
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest
is
responsible
for
overseeing
the
oil
of
the
lighting

perfumed
incense

oil
He
has
oversight
of
the
entire
tabernacle
and
all
that
is
in
it
including
the
holy
place
and
its
utensils
17
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
and
Aaron
saying
18
Do
not
let
the
tribe
of
the
families
of
the
Kohathites
be
cut
off
from
among
the
Levites
19
But
do
this
for
them
that
they
may
remain
alive
and
not
die
because
of
approaching
the
most
holy
things
Aaron
and
his
sons
will
go
in
and
assign
each
of
them
to
his
service
and
what
he
is
to
carry
20
They
must
not
come
in
and
see
the
holy
things
even
for
an
instant
or
they
will
die
21
Then
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
saying
22
A

and

they
were

just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
1
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
2
Command
the
Israelites
to
send
out
of
the
camp
every
leprous
person
and
everyone
having
a
discharge
and
everyone
unclean
by
a
dead
person
3
Whether
a
male
or
a
female
you
should
send
them
out
You
should
send
them
outside
the
camp
so
that
they
may
not
contaminate
the
camps
of
those
in
whose
midst
I
am
dwelling
4
Therefore
the
Israelites
did
so
and
sent
them
outside
the
camp
Just
as
Jehovah
told
Moses
so
the
Israelites
did
5
Jehovah
continued
speaking
to
Moses
saying
6
Tell
the
Israelites
If
a
man
or
a
woman
commits
any
of
the
sins
of
mankind
and
acts
unfaithfully
toward
Jehovah
that
person
has
become
guilty
7
He
must
confess
the
sin
that
he
has
committed
and
return
the
full
amount
as
compensation
for
his
guilt
and
also
add
a
fifth
of
its
value
he
is
to
give
it
to
the
one
he
wronged
8
But
if
the
victim
does
not
have
a
close
relative
to
receive
the
compensation
it
should
be
returned
to
Jehovah
and
will
belong
to
the
priest
apart
from
the
ram
of
atonement
with
which
he
will
make
atonement
for
him
9
Every
holy
contribution
from
the
Israelites
that
is
presented
to
the
priest
should
become
his
10
The
holy
things
of
each
person
will
remain
his
own
Whatever
each
one
gives
to
the
priest
that
will
belong
to
the
priest
11
Jehovah
went
on
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
12
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
This
is
what
should
be
done
if
a
mans
wife
goes
astray
and
is
unfaithful
to
him
13
and
another
man
has
sexual
relations
with
her
but
it
was
unknown
to
her
husband
and
remains
undiscovered
so
that
she
has
defiled
herself
but
there
is
no
witness
against
her
and
she
has
not
been
caught
14
Whether
the
husband
becomes
jealous
and
suspicious
of
his
wifes
faithfulness
when
she
has
defiled
herself
or
whether
he
is
jealous
and
suspicious
of
his
wifes
faithfulness
when
she
has
not
defiled
herself
15
the
man
must
bring
his
wife
to
the
priest
along
with
an
offering
for
her
a
tenth
of
an
ephah
of
barley
flour
He
must
not
pour
oil
on
it
nor
put
frankincense
on
it
because
it
is
a
grain
offering
of
jealousy
a
grain
offering
bringing
guilt
to
mind
16
The
priest
will
bring
her
forward
and
make
her
stand
before
Jehovah
17
The
priest
will
take
holy
water
in
an
earthenware
vessel
and
the
priest
will
take
some
of
the
dust
from
the
floor
of
the
tabernacle
and
put
it
in
the
water
18
And
the
priest
will
make
the
woman
stand
before
Jehovah
and
unbind
the
womans
hair
and
put
in
her
palms
the
grain
offering
for
a
reminder
that
is
the
grain
offering
of
jealousy
and
the
priest
will
have
in
his
hand
the
bitter
water
that
brings
a
curse
19
The
priest
will
then
make
her
swear
saying
to
the
woman
If
no
other
man
had
sexual
relations
with
you
while
you
were
under
your
husbands
authority
and
you
have
not
gone
astray
and
become
defiled
may
you
be
free
of
the
effect
of
this
bitter
water
that
brings
a
curse
20
But
if
you
have
gone
astray
while
under
your
husbands
authority
by
defiling
yourself
and
you
have
had
sexual
relations
with
another
man
besides
your
husband—
21
The
priest
will
then
make
the
woman
swear
an
oath
that
includes
a
curse
and
the
priest
will
say
to
the
woman
May
Jehovah
make
you
an
object
for
cursing
and
for
an
oath
among
your
people
as
Jehovah
makes
your
thigh
fall
away
and
causes
your
abdomen
to
swell
22
This
water
that
brings
a
curse
will
enter
into
your
intestines
to
cause
your
abdomen
to
swell
and
make
your
thigh
fall
away
To
this
the
woman
should
say
Amen
Amen
23
Then
the
priest
should
write
these
curses
in
the
book
and
wash
them
off
into
the
bitter
water
24
He
will
then
make
the
woman
drink
the
bitter
water
that
brings
a
curse
and
the
water
that
brings
a
curse
will
enter
into
her
and
produce
bitterness
25
And
the
priest
should
take
the
grain
offering
of
jealousy
from
the
womans
hand
and
wave
the
grain
offering
back
and
forth
before
Jehovah
and
he
will
bring
it
near
the
altar
26
The
priest
will
take
a
handful
of
the
grain
offering
as
a
token
offering
and
make
it
smoke
on
the
altar
and
afterward
he
will
make
the
woman
drink
the
water
27
When
he
makes
her
drink
the
water
if
she
has
defiled
herself
and
committed
an
act
of
unfaithfulness
toward
her
husband
the
water
that
brings
a
curse
will
then
enter
into
her
and
become
something
bitter
and
her
abdomen
will
swell
and
her
thigh
will
fall
away
and
the
woman
will
become
an
object
of
cursing
among
her
people
28
However
if
the
woman
has
not
defiled
herself
and
is
clean
she
will
then
be
free
from
such
punishment
and
she
will
be
able
to
conceive
and
produce
offspring
29
This
is
the
law
about
jealousy
when
a
woman
may
go
astray
and
defile
herself
while
under
her
husbands
authority
30
or
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
becomes
jealous
and
suspects
his
wife
of
unfaithfulness
he
should
make
his
wife
stand
before
Jehovah
and
the
priest
must
carry
out
toward
her
all
this
law
31
The
man
will
be
free
from
guilt
but
his
wife
will
answer
for
her
guilt
1
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
and
said
2
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
If
a
man
or
a
woman
takes
a
special
vow
to
live
as
a
Nazirite
to
Jehovah
3
he
should
keep
away
from
wine
and
other
alcoholic
beverages
He
should
not
drink
the
vinegar
of
wine
or
the
vinegar
of
anything
alcoholic
He
should
not
drink
any
liquid
made
from
grapes
nor
eat
grapes
whether
fresh
or
dried
4
All
the
days
of
his
Naziriteship
he
should
not
eat
anything
made
from
the
grapevine
from
the
unripe
grapes
to
the
skins
5
All
the
days
of
the
vow
of
his
Naziriteship
no
razor
should
pass
over
his
head
He
is
to
remain
holy
by
letting
the
hair
of
his
head
grow
until
the
days
of
his
being
set
apart
to
Jehovah
are
completed
6
He
should
not
approach
a
dead
person
during
all
the
days
he
remains
separated
to
Jehovah
7
Even
if
his
father
or
his
mother
or
his
brother
or
his
sister
should
die
he
may
not
defile
himself
because
the
sign
of
his
Naziriteship
to
his
God
is
upon
his
head
8
He
is
holy
to
Jehovah
all
the
days
of
his
Naziriteship
9
But
if
someone
should
suddenly
die
alongside
him
and
he
defiles
the
hair
symbolizing
his
separation
to
God
he
must
shave
his
head
on
the
day
he
establishes
his
purification
He
should
shave
it
on
the
seventh
day
10
And
on
the
eighth
day
he
should
bring
two
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
to
the
priest
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
11
The
priest
will
prepare
one
as
a
sin
offering
and
the
other
as
a
burnt
offering
and
make
atonement
for
him
for
his
sin
in
connection
with
the
dead
person
Then
he
must
sanctify
his
head
on
that
day
12
And
he
must
separate
himself
again
to
Jehovah
for
the
days
of
his
Naziriteship
and
he
will
bring
a
young
ram
in
its
first
year
as
a
guilt
offering
However
the
former
days
will
go
uncounted
because
he
defiled
his
Naziriteship
13
Now
this
is
the
law
about
the
Nazirite
When
he
completes
the
days
of
his
Naziriteship
he
will
be
brought
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
14
There
he
must
present
his
offering
to
Jehovah
one
sound
young
ram
in
its
first
year
as
a
burnt
offering
one
sound
female
lamb
in
its
first
year
as
a
sin
offering
one
sound
ram
as
a
communion
sacrifice
15
a
basket
of
unleavened
ring-shaped
loaves
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
oil
unleavened
wafers
smeared
with
oil
and
their
grain
offering
and
their
drink
offerings
16
The
priest
will
present
them
before
Jehovah
and
will
offer
up
his
sin
offering
and
his
burnt
offering
17
He
will
offer
the
ram
as
a
communion
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
along
with
the
basket
of
unleavened
loaves
and
the
priest
will
present
its
grain
offering
and
its
drink
offering
18
The
Nazirite
must
then
shave
the
uncut
hair
of
his
head
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
he
will
take
the
hair
of
his
head
grown
during
his
Naziriteship
and
put
it
on
the
fire
that
is
under
the
communion
sacrifice
19
And
the
priest
must
take
a
boiled
shoulder
from
the
ram
one
unleavened
ring-shaped
loaf
from
the
basket
and
one
unleavened
wafer
and
put
them
on
the
palms
of
the
Nazirite
after
he
has
had
the
sign
of
his
Naziriteship
shaved
off
20
And
the
priest
must
wave
them
back
and
forth
as
a
wave
offering
before
Jehovah
It
is
something
holy
for
the
priest
along
with
the
breast
of
the
wave
offering
and
the
leg
of
the
contribution
Afterward
the
Nazirite
may
drink
wine
21
This
is
the
law
about
the
Nazirite
who
makes
a
vow
If
he
vows
and
can
afford
to
make
an
offering
to
Jehovah
that
is
beyond
the
requirements
of
his
Naziriteship
he
must
then
carry
out
his
vow
out
of
regard
for
the
law
of
his
Naziriteship
22
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
23
Tell
Aaron
and
his
sons
This
is
the
way
you
should
bless
the
people
of
Israel
Say
to
them
24
May
Jehovah
bless
you
and
safeguard
you
25
May
Jehovah
make
his
face
shine
upon
you
and
may
he
favor
you
26
May
Jehovah
lift
up
his
face
toward
you
and
grant
you
peace
27
And
they
must
place
my
name
upon
the
people
of
Israel
that
I
may
bless
them
1
On
the
day
that
Moses
finished
setting
up
the
tabernacle
he
anointed
it
and
sanctified
it
together
with
all
its
furnishings
the
altar
and
all
its
utensils
When
he
had
anointed
and
sanctified
these
things
2
the
chieftains
of
Israel
the
heads
of
their
paternal
houses
made
an
offering
These
chieftains
of
the
tribes
who
presided
over
the
registration
3
brought
before
Jehovah
their
offering
of
six
covered
wagons
and
12
oxen
a
wagon
for
two
chieftains
and
a
bull
for
each
one
and
they
presented
them
before
the
tabernacle
4
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
5
Accept
these
things
from
them
as
they
will
be
used
for
the
service
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
you
should
give
them
to
the
Levites
to
each
one
as
needed
for
his
duties
6
So
Moses
accepted
the
wagons
and
the
cattle
and
gave
them
to
the
Levites
7
He
gave
two
wagons
and
four
oxen
to
the
sons
of
Gershon
according
to
what
was
needed
for
their
duties
8
and
he
gave
four
wagons
and
eight
oxen
to
the
sons
of
Merari
according
to
what
was
needed
for
their
duties
under
the
direction
of
Ithamar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest
9
But
he
did
not
give
any
to
the
sons
of
Kohath
because
their
duties
involved
the
service
of
the
holy
place
and
they
carried
the
holy
things
on
their
shoulders
10
Now
the
chieftains
made
their
presentation
at
the
inauguration
of
the
altar
on
the
day
it
was
anointed
When
the
chieftains
presented
their
offering
before
the
altar
11
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
One
chieftain
each
day
on
successive
days
will
present
his
offering
for
the
inauguration
of
the
altar
12

This
was

This
was
the
inauguration

of
the

from
the
chieftains
of
Israel
when
it
was
anointed
12
silver

each
a
year
old
This
was
the
inauguration
offering
of
the
altar
after
it
was
anointed
89
Whenever
Moses
went
into
the
tent
of
meeting
to
speak
with
God
he
would
hear
the
voice
conversing
with
him
from
above
the
cover
of
the
ark
of
the
Testimony
from
between
the
two
cherubs
and
God
would
speak
to
him
1
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
saying
2
Speak
to
Aaron
and
tell
him
When
you
light
up
the
lamps
the
seven
lamps
should
shine
on
the
area
in
front
of
the
lampstand
3
So
Aaron
did
this
He
lit
up
its
lamps
for
the
area
in
front
of
the
lampstand
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
4
This
is
how
the
lampstand
was
made
It
was
hammered
work
of
gold
from
its
stem
to
its
blossoms
it
was
hammered
work
The
lampstand
was
made
according
to
the
vision
that
Jehovah
had
shown
Moses
5
Jehovah
spoke
again
to
Moses
saying
6
Take
the
Levites
from
among
the
Israelites
and
cleanse
them
7
This
is
how
you
should
cleanse
them
Sprinkle
sin-cleansing
water
on
them
and
they
must
shave
their
whole
body
with
a
razor
wash
their
garments
and
cleanse
themselves
8
Then
they
will
take
a
young
bull
and
its
grain
offering
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
oil
and
you
will
take
another
young
bull
for
a
sin
offering
9
And
you
are
to
present
the
Levites
before
the
tent
of
meeting
and
gather
all
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
10
When
you
present
the
Levites
before
Jehovah
the
Israelites
are
to
lay
their
hands
on
the
Levites
11
And
Aaron
must
offer
the
Levites
before
Jehovah
as
a
wave
offering
from
the
Israelites
and
they
will
carry
out
the
service
of
Jehovah
12
Then
the
Levites
will
lay
their
hands
on
the
heads
of
the
bulls
and
offer
the
one
as
a
sin
offering
and
the
other
as
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
to
make
atonement
for
the
Levites
13
And
you
will
have
the
Levites
stand
before
Aaron
and
his
sons
and
offer
them
as
a
wave
offering
to
Jehovah
14
You
must
separate
the
Levites
from
among
the
Israelites
and
the
Levites
will
become
mine
15
Afterward
the
Levites
will
come
in
to
serve
at
the
tent
of
meeting
This
is
how
you
should
cleanse
them
and
offer
them
as
a
wave
offering
16
For
they
are
given
ones
given
to
me
from
among
the
Israelites
In
place
of
all
those
who
are
firstborn
of
the
Israelites
I
will
take
them
for
myself
17
For
every
firstborn
among
the
Israelites
is
mine
both
man
and
animal
I
sanctified
them
to
myself
on
the
day
I
struck
down
every
firstborn
in
the
land
of
Egypt
18
I
will
take
the
Levites
in
place
of
all
the
firstborn
among
the
Israelites
19
I
will
give
the
Levites
as
given
ones
to
Aaron
and
his
sons
from
among
the
Israelites
to
carry
out
the
service
in
behalf
of
the
Israelites
at
the
tent
of
meeting
and
to
make
atonement
for
the
Israelites
so
that
no
plague
may
occur
among
the
Israelites
because
the
people
of
Israel
come
near
the
holy
place
20
Moses
and
Aaron
and
all
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
did
this
with
the
Levites
In
accord
with
all
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
regarding
the
Levites
that
is
what
the
Israelites
did
with
them
21
So
the
Levites
purified
themselves
and
washed
their
garments
after
which
Aaron
offered
them
as
a
wave
offering
before
Jehovah
Then
Aaron
made
atonement
for
them
to
cleanse
them
22
Thereafter
the
Levites
went
in
to
carry
out
their
service
at
the
tent
of
meeting
before
Aaron
and
his
sons
Just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
respecting
the
Levites
so
they
did
with
them
23
Jehovah
now
spoke
to
Moses
saying
24
This
applies
to
the
Levites
From
25
years
old
and
up
a
man
will
join
the
company
of
those
in
the
service
of
the
tent
of
meeting
25
But
after
the
age
of
50
years
he
will
retire
from
the
service
company
and
not
serve
any
longer
26
He
may
minister
to
his
brothers
who
are
taking
care
of
the
responsibilities
at
the
tent
of
meeting
but
he
must
not
perform
the
service
there
This
is
what
you
are
to
do
regarding
the
Levites
and
their
responsibilities
1
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
in
the
first
month
of
the
second
year
after
they
had
come
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
saying
2
The
Israelites
should
prepare
the
Passover
sacrifice
at
its
appointed
time
3
On
the
14th
day
of
this
month
at
twilight
you
should
prepare
it
at
its
appointed
time
According
to
all
its
statutes
and
all
its
set
procedures
you
should
prepare
it
4
So
Moses
told
the
Israelites
to
prepare
the
Passover
sacrifice
5
Then
they
prepared
the
Passover
sacrifice
in
the
first
month
on
the
14th
day
of
the
month
at
twilight
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
According
to
all
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
so
the
Israelites
did
6
Now
there
were
men
who
had
become
unclean
by
touching
a
dead
body
so
that
they
were
not
able
to
prepare
the
Passover
sacrifice
on
that
day
So
those
men
presented
themselves
before
Moses
and
Aaron
on
that
day
7
and
said
to
him
We
are
unclean
because
of
touching
a
dead
body
Why
should
we
be
kept
from
presenting
the
offering
to
Jehovah
at
its
appointed
time
among
the
Israelites
8
At
this
Moses
said
to
them
Wait
there
and
let
me
hear
what
Jehovah
may
command
regarding
you
9
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
10
Tell
the
Israelites
Although
any
man
among
you
or
of
your
future
generations
should
become
unclean
by
touching
a
dead
body
or
should
be
off
on
a
distant
journey
he
must
still
prepare
the
Passover
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
11
They
should
prepare
it
in
the
second
month
on
the
14th
day
at
twilight
They
should
eat
it
together
with
unleavened
bread
and
bitter
greens
12
They
must
not
let
any
of
it
remain
until
morning
and
they
should
not
break
any
bone
in
it
They
should
prepare
it
according
to
every
statute
regarding
the
Passover
13
But
if
a
man
was
clean
or
was
not
off
on
a
journey
and
neglected
to
prepare
the
Passover
sacrifice
that
person
must
then
be
cut
off
from
his
people
because
he
did
not
present
the
offering
of
Jehovah
at
its
appointed
time
That
man
will
answer
for
his
sin
14
And
if
a
foreign
resident
is
residing
with
you
he
should
also
prepare
the
Passover
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
He
should
do
so
according
to
the
statute
of
the
Passover
and
its
set
procedure
There
should
exist
one
statute
for
you
both
for
the
foreign
resident
and
for
the
native
of
the
land
15
Now
on
the
day
the
tabernacle
was
set
up
the
cloud
covered
the
tabernacle
the
tent
of
the
Testimony
but
in
the
evening
what
appeared
to
be
fire
remained
over
the
tabernacle
until
morning
16
That
is
what
continued
to
take
place
The
cloud
would
cover
it
by
day
and
the
appearance
of
fire
by
night
17
Whenever
the
cloud
lifted
from
the
tent
the
Israelites
would
promptly
depart
and
in
the
place
where
the
cloud
would
remain
there
is
where
the
Israelites
would
encamp
18
At
the
order
of
Jehovah
the
Israelites
would
depart
and
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
they
would
encamp
As
long
as
the
cloud
remained
over
the
tabernacle
they
would
remain
encamped
19
When
the
cloud
would
stay
over
the
tabernacle
for
many
days
the
Israelites
would
obey
Jehovah
and
not
depart
20
Sometimes
the
cloud
would
remain
for
a
few
days
over
the
tabernacle
At
the
order
of
Jehovah
they
would
remain
encamped
and
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
they
would
depart
21
Sometimes
the
cloud
would
remain
only
from
evening
until
morning
and
when
the
cloud
lifted
in
the
morning
they
would
depart
Whether
it
was
day
or
night
when
the
cloud
lifted
they
would
depart
22
Whether
it
was
two
days
a
month
or
longer
as
long
as
the
cloud
stayed
over
the
tabernacle
the
Israelites
remained
encamped
and
would
not
depart
But
when
it
lifted
they
would
depart
23
At
the
order
of
Jehovah
they
would
encamp
and
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
they
would
depart
They
kept
their
obligation
to
Jehovah
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
through
Moses
1
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
2
Make
two
trumpets
for
yourself
make
them
of
hammered
silver
and
use
them
to
summon
the
assembly
and
to
break
up
the
camps
3
When
both
of
them
are
blown
the
whole
assembly
must
be
summoned
to
you
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
4
If
just
one
is
blown
only
the
chieftains
the
heads
of
the
thousands
of
Israel
will
be
summoned
to
you
5
When
you
sound
a
fluctuating
trumpet
blast
the
camps
of
those
to
the
east
should
depart
6
When
you
sound
a
fluctuating
trumpet
blast
a
second
time
the
camps
of
those
to
the
south
should
depart
They
should
sound
the
trumpet
blasts
in
this
way
each
time
one
of
them
departs
7
Now
when
calling
the
congregation
together
you
should
blow
the
trumpets
but
not
with
fluctuating
blasts
8
Aarons
sons
the
priests
should
blow
the
trumpets
and
the
use
of
them
will
serve
as
a
lasting
statute
for
you
throughout
your
generations
9
If
you
should
go
to
war
in
your
land
against
an
oppressor
who
is
harassing
you
you
should
sound
a
war
call
on
the
trumpets
and
you
will
be
remembered
by
Jehovah
your
God
and
be
saved
from
your
enemies
10
Also
on
your
joyous
occasions—your
festivals
and
at
the
beginning
of
your
months—you
are
to
sound
the
trumpets
over
your
burnt
offerings
and
your
communion
sacrifices
they
will
serve
as
a
reminder
for
you
before
your
God
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
11
Now
in
the
second
year
in
the
second
month
on
the
20th
day
of
the
month
the
cloud
lifted
from
over
the
tabernacle
of
the
Testimony
12
So
the
Israelites
began
to
pull
away
from
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
in
the
order
established
for
their
departure
and
the
cloud
settled
in
the
wilderness
of
Paran
13
This
was
the
first
time
they
departed
following
the
order
of
Jehovah
through
Moses
14
So
the
three-tribe
division
of
the
camp
of
the
sons
of
Judah
departed
first
by
their
companies
and
Nahshon
the
son
of
Amminadab
was
over
its
company
15
Over
the
company
of
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Issachar
was
Nethanel
the
son
of
Zuar
16
Over
the
company
of
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Zebulun
was
Eliab
the
son
of
Helon
17
When
the
tabernacle
was
taken
down
the
sons
of
Gershon
and
the
sons
of
Merari
who
carried
the
tabernacle
departed
18
Then
the
three-tribe
division
of
the
camp
of
Reuben
departed
by
their
companies
and
Elizur
the
son
of
Shedeur
was
over
its
company
19
Over
the
company
of
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Simeon
was
Shelumiel
the
son
of
Zurishaddai
20
Over
the
company
of
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Gad
was
Eliasaph
the
son
of
Deuel
21
Then
the
Kohathites
who
carried
the
sanctuary
items
departed
The
tabernacle
was
to
be
set
up
by
the
time
they
arrived
22
Then
the
three-tribe
division
of
the
camp
of
the
sons
of
Ephraim
departed
by
their
companies
and
Elishama
the
son
of
Ammihud
was
over
its
company
23
Over
the
company
of
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Manasseh
was
Gamaliel
the
son
of
Pedahzur
24
Over
the
company
of
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Benjamin
was
Abidan
the
son
of
Gideoni
25
Then
the
three-tribe
division
of
the
camp
of
the
sons
of
Dan
departed
by
their
companies
forming
the
rear
guard
for
all
the
camps
and
Ahiezer
the
son
of
Ammishaddai
was
over
its
company
26
Over
the
company
of
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Asher
was
Pagiel
the
son
of
Ochran
27
Over
the
company
of
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Naphtali
was
Ahira
the
son
of
Enan
28
This
was
the
order
of
departure
that
the
Israelites
and
their
companies
followed
when
they
would
depart
29
Then
Moses
said
to
Hobab
the
son
of
Reuel
the
Midianite
the
father-in-law
of
Moses
We
are
setting
out
for
the
place
about
which
Jehovah
said
I
will
give
it
to
you
Do
come
with
us
and
we
will
treat
you
well
because
Jehovah
has
promised
good
things
for
Israel
30
But
he
said
to
him
I
will
not
go
I
will
return
to
my
own
country
and
to
my
relatives
31
At
this
he
said
Please
do
not
leave
us
for
you
know
where
we
should
camp
in
the
wilderness
and
you
can
serve
as
our
guide
32
And
if
you
do
come
with
us
whatever
goodness
Jehovah
shows
to
us
we
will
surely
show
to
you
33
So
they
began
marching
from
the
mountain
of
Jehovah
for
a
journey
of
three
days
and
the
ark
of
Jehovahs
covenant
traveled
before
them
for
the
three-day
journey
to
search
out
a
resting-place
for
them
34
And
Jehovahs
cloud
was
over
them
by
day
when
they
set
out
from
the
encampment
35
Whenever
the
Ark
was
moved
Moses
would
say
Rise
up
O
Jehovah
and
let
your
enemies
be
scattered
and
let
those
who
hate
you
flee
from
before
you
36
And
when
it
would
rest
he
would
say
Do
return
O
Jehovah
to
the
countless
thousands
of
Israel
1
Now
the
people
began
to
complain
bitterly
before
Jehovah
When
Jehovah
heard
it
his
anger
flared
and
a
fire
from
Jehovah
began
to
blaze
against
them
and
to
consume
some
on
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
2
When
the
people
began
to
cry
out
to
Moses
he
made
supplication
to
Jehovah
and
the
fire
died
out
3
So
that
place
was
given
the
name
Taberah
because
a
fire
from
Jehovah
had
blazed
against
them
4
The
mixed
crowd
who
were
in
their
midst
then
expressed
selfish
longing
and
the
Israelites
too
began
to
weep
again
and
say
Who
will
give
us
meat
to
eat
5
How
fondly
we
remember
the
fish
that
we
used
to
eat
without
cost
in
Egypt
also
the
cucumbers
the
watermelons
the
leeks
the
onions
and
the
garlic
6
But
now
we
are
withering
away
We
see
nothing
at
all
except
this
manna
7
Incidentally
the
manna
was
like
coriander
seed
and
it
looked
like
bdellium
gum
8
The
people
would
spread
out
and
pick
it
up
and
grind
it
in
hand
mills
or
pound
it
in
a
mortar
Then
they
would
boil
it
in
cooking
pots
or
make
it
into
round
loaves
and
it
tasted
like
an
oiled
sweet
cake
9
When
the
dew
descended
on
the
camp
by
night
the
manna
would
also
descend
on
it
10
Moses
heard
the
people
weeping
family
after
family
each
man
at
the
entrance
of
his
tent
And
Jehovah
became
very
angry
and
Moses
was
also
very
displeased
11
Then
Moses
said
to
Jehovah
Why
have
you
afflicted
your
servant
Why
have
I
not
found
favor
in
your
eyes
so
that
you
put
the
burden
of
all
this
people
on
me
12
Did
I
conceive
all
this
people
Did
I
give
birth
to
them
so
that
you
should
tell
me
Carry
them
in
your
bosom
just
as
an
attendant
carries
the
nursing
child

to
the
land
that
you
swore
to
give
to
their
forefathers
13
From
where
will
I
get
meat
to
give
to
all
this
people
For
they
keep
weeping
before
me
saying
Give
us
meat
to
eat
14
I
am
not
able
to
bear
all
this
people
by
myself
it
is
too
much
for
me
15
If
this
is
how
you
are
going
to
treat
me
please
kill
me
right
now
If
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
do
not
make
me
see
any
more
calamity
16
Jehovah
replied
to
Moses
Gather
for
me
70
men
from
the
elders
of
Israel
men
whom
you
recognize
as
elders
and
officials
of
the
people
and
take
them
to
the
tent
of
meeting
and
have
them
stand
there
with
you
17
I
will
come
down
and
speak
with
you
there
and
I
will
take
away
some
of
the
spirit
that
is
on
you
and
place
it
on
them
and
they
will
help
you
in
bearing
the
burden
of
the
people
so
that
you
may
not
have
to
bear
it
alone
18
You
should
say
to
the
people
Sanctify
yourselves
for
tomorrow
for
you
will
certainly
eat
meat
because
you
have
wept
in
Jehovahs
hearing
and
have
said
Who
will
give
us
meat
to
eat
It
was
better
for
us
in
Egypt
Jehovah
will
certainly
give
you
meat
and
you
will
eat
19
You
will
eat
not
one
day
nor
2
days
nor
5
days
nor
10
days
nor
20
days
20
but
for
a
whole
month
of
days
until
it
comes
out
of
your
nostrils
and
it
has
become
loathsome
to
you
for
you
rejected
Jehovah
who
is
in
your
midst
and
you
were
weeping
before
him
saying
Why
is
it
that
we
have
come
out
of
Egypt
21
Then
Moses
said
The
people
I
am
among
number
600000
men
on
foot
and
yet
you
yourself
have
said
Meat
I
will
give
them
and
they
will
eat
enough
for
a
whole
month
of
days
22
If
whole
flocks
and
herds
were
slaughtered
would
it
be
enough
for
them
Or
if
all
the
fish
of
the
sea
were
caught
would
it
be
enough
for
them
23
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
Is
the
hand
of
Jehovah
too
short
Now
you
will
see
whether
what
I
say
will
happen
to
you
or
not
24
So
Moses
went
out
and
spoke
the
words
of
Jehovah
to
the
people
And
he
gathered
70
men
from
the
elders
of
the
people
and
had
them
stand
around
the
tent
25
Then
Jehovah
came
down
in
a
cloud
and
spoke
to
him
and
took
away
some
of
the
spirit
that
was
on
him
and
put
it
on
each
of
the
70
elders
And
as
soon
as
the
spirit
settled
down
on
them
they
began
to
behave
as
prophets
but
they
did
not
do
it
again
26
There
were
two
of
the
men
still
in
the
camp
Their
names
were
Eldad
and
Medad
And
the
spirit
began
to
settle
down
on
them
as
they
were
among
those
whose
names
had
been
written
down
but
they
had
not
gone
out
to
the
tent
So
they
began
to
behave
as
prophets
in
the
camp
27
And
a
young
man
ran
and
reported
to
Moses
Eldad
and
Medad
are
behaving
as
prophets
in
the
camp
28
Then
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
the
minister
of
Moses
from
his
youth
responded
and
said
My
lord
Moses
restrain
them
29
But
Moses
said
to
him
Are
you
jealous
for
me
No
I
wish
that
all
of
Jehovahs
people
were
prophets
and
that
Jehovah
would
put
his
spirit
on
them
30
Later
Moses
returned
to
the
camp
along
with
the
elders
of
Israel
31
Then
a
wind
from
Jehovah
sprang
up
and
began
driving
quail
from
the
sea
and
causing
them
to
fall
around
the
camp
about
a
days
journey
on
this
side
and
a
days
journey
on
the
other
side
all
around
the
camp
and
they
were
about
two
cubits
deep
on
the
ground
32
So
all
that
day
and
all
night
and
all
the
next
day
the
people
stayed
up
and
gathered
the
quail
No
one
gathered
less
than
ten
homers
and
they
kept
spreading
them
all
around
the
camp
for
themselves
33
But
while
the
meat
was
still
between
their
teeth
before
it
could
be
chewed
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
the
people
and
Jehovah
began
striking
the
people
with
a
very
great
slaughter
34
So
they
gave
that
place
the
name
Kibroth-hattaavah
because
there
they
buried
the
people
who
showed
selfish
craving
35
From
Kibroth-hattaavah
the
people
departed
for
Hazeroth
and
they
remained
at
Hazeroth
1
Now
Miriam
and
Aaron
began
to
speak
against
Moses
because
of
the
Cushite
wife
he
had
married
for
he
had
taken
a
Cushite
wife
2
They
were
saying
Is
it
only
by
Moses
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
Has
he
not
also
spoken
through
us
And
Jehovah
was
listening
3
Now
the
man
Moses
was
by
far
the
meekest
of
all
the
men
on
the
face
of
the
earth
4
Jehovah
suddenly
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
and
Miriam
Go
out
the
three
of
you
to
the
tent
of
meeting
So
the
three
of
them
went
out
5
And
Jehovah
came
down
in
the
pillar
of
cloud
and
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
and
called
Aaron
and
Miriam
Both
of
them
went
forward
6
He
then
said
Hear
my
words
please
If
there
was
a
prophet
of
Jehovah
among
you
I
would
make
myself
known
to
him
in
a
vision
and
I
would
speak
to
him
in
a
dream
7
But
it
is
not
that
way
with
my
servant
Moses
He
is
being
entrusted
with
all
my
house
8
Face-to-face
I
speak
to
him
openly
not
by
riddles
and
the
appearance
of
Jehovah
is
what
he
sees
Why
then
did
you
not
fear
to
speak
against
my
servant
against
Moses
9
So
Jehovahs
anger
burned
against
them
and
he
departed
from
them
10
The
cloud
moved
away
from
over
the
tent
and
look
Miriam
was
struck
with
leprosy
as
white
as
snow
Then
Aaron
turned
toward
Miriam
and
he
saw
that
she
was
struck
with
leprosy
11
Immediately
Aaron
said
to
Moses
I
beg
you
my
lord
Please
do
not
hold
this
sin
against
us
We
have
acted
foolishly
in
what
we
have
done
12
Please
do
not
let
her
continue
like
someone
dead
whose
flesh
is
half
eaten
away
at
birth
13
And
Moses
began
to
cry
out
to
Jehovah
saying
O
God
please
heal
her
Please
14
Jehovah
replied
to
Moses
If
her
father
would
spit
directly
in
her
face
would
she
not
be
humiliated
for
seven
days
Let
her
be
quarantined
for
seven
days
outside
the
camp
and
afterward
she
may
be
brought
back
in
15
So
Miriam
was
quarantined
outside
the
camp
for
seven
days
and
the
people
did
not
break
camp
until
Miriam
was
brought
back
in
16
Then
the
people
departed
from
Hazeroth
and
began
camping
in
the
wilderness
of
Paran
1
Jehovah
now
spoke
to
Moses
saying
2
Send
out
men
to
spy
out
the
land
of
Canaan
which
I
am
giving
to
the
Israelites
You
are
to
send
out
one
man
from
each
ancestral
tribe
each
one
a
chieftain
among
them
3
So
Moses
sent
them
out
from
the
wilderness
of
Paran
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
All
the
men
were
heads
of
the
Israelites
4
These
are
their
names
of
the
tribe
of
Reuben
Shammua
the
son
of
Zaccur
5
of
the
tribe
of
Simeon
Shaphat
the
son
of
Hori
6
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
7
of
the
tribe
of
Issachar
Igal
the
son
of
Joseph
8
of
the
tribe
of
Ephraim
Hoshea
the
son
of
Nun
9
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
Palti
the
son
of
Raphu
10
of
the
tribe
of
Zebulun
Gaddiel
the
son
of
Sodi
11
of
the
tribe
of
Joseph
for
the
tribe
of
Manasseh
Gaddi
the
son
of
Susi
12
of
the
tribe
of
Dan
Ammiel
the
son
of
Gemalli
13
of
the
tribe
of
Asher
Sethur
the
son
of
Michael
14
of
the
tribe
of
Naphtali
Nahbi
the
son
of
Vophsi
15
of
the
tribe
of
Gad
Geuel
the
son
of
Machi
16
These
are
the
names
of
the
men
whom
Moses
sent
to
spy
out
the
land
And
Moses
gave
the
name
Joshua
to
Hoshea
the
son
of
Nun
17
When
Moses
was
sending
them
to
spy
out
the
land
of
Canaan
he
said
to
them
Go
up
there
into
the
Negeb
and
then
go
up
into
the
mountainous
region
18
You
must
see
what
kind
of
land
it
is
and
whether
the
people
who
are
dwelling
in
it
are
strong
or
weak
few
or
many
19
and
whether
the
land
is
good
or
bad
and
whether
the
cities
they
are
dwelling
in
are
encampments
or
fortifications
20
And
find
out
whether
the
land
is
rich
or
poor
and
whether
there
are
trees
in
it
or
not
You
must
be
courageous
and
take
some
of
the
fruitage
of
the
land
Now
it
was
the
season
of
the
first
ripe
grapes
21
So
they
went
up
and
spied
out
the
land
from
the
wilderness
of
Zin
to
Rehob
to
Lebo-hamath
22
When
they
went
up
into
the
Negeb
they
came
to
Hebron
where
Ahiman
Sheshai
and
Talmai
the
Anakim
were
living
Incidentally
Hebron
had
been
built
seven
years
before
Zoan
of
Egypt
23
When
they
came
to
the
Valley
of
Eshcol
there
they
cut
down
a
branch
with
one
cluster
of
grapes
which
two
of
the
men
had
to
carry
on
a
bar
as
well
as
some
of
the
pomegranates
and
figs
24
They
called
that
place
the
Valley
of
Eshcol
because
of
the
cluster
that
the
Israelites
cut
down
from
there
25
At
the
end
of
40
days
they
returned
from
spying
out
the
land
26
So
they
came
back
to
Moses
and
Aaron
and
all
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
in
the
wilderness
of
Paran
at
Kadesh
They
brought
back
a
report
to
all
the
assembly
and
showed
them
the
fruitage
of
the
land
27
This
is
what
they
reported
to
Moses
We
entered
the
land
into
which
you
sent
us
and
it
is
indeed
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
this
is
its
fruitage
28
Nevertheless
the
people
who
dwell
in
the
land
are
strong
and
the
fortified
cities
are
very
great
We
also
saw
the
Anakim
there
29
The
Amalekites
are
dwelling
in
the
land
of
the
Negeb
and
the
Hittites
the
Jebusites
and
the
Amorites
are
dwelling
in
the
mountainous
region
and
the
Canaanites
are
dwelling
by
the
sea
and
along
the
Jordan
30
Then
Caleb
tried
to
calm
the
people
as
they
stood
before
Moses
by
saying
Let
us
go
up
immediately
and
we
are
sure
to
take
possession
of
it
because
we
can
surely
conquer
it
31
But
the
men
who
went
up
with
him
said
We
are
not
able
to
go
up
against
the
people
because
they
are
stronger
than
we
are
32
And
they
kept
on
giving
the
Israelites
a
bad
report
about
the
land
that
they
had
spied
out
saying
The
land
that
we
passed
through
to
spy
out
is
a
land
that
devours
its
inhabitants
and
all
the
people
whom
we
saw
in
it
are
men
of
extraordinary
size
33
And
there
we
saw
the
Nephilim
the
sons
of
Anak
who
are
from
the
Nephilim
and
in
comparison
we
seemed
like
grasshoppers
both
to
us
and
to
them
1
Then
all
the
assembly
raised
their
voice
and
the
people
continued
crying
out
and
weeping
all
through
that
night
2
All
the
Israelites
began
to
murmur
against
Moses
and
Aaron
and
the
whole
assembly
spoke
against
them
saying
If
only
we
had
died
in
the
land
of
Egypt
or
if
only
we
had
died
in
this
wilderness
3
Why
is
Jehovah
bringing
us
to
this
land
to
fall
by
the
sword
Our
wives
and
children
will
become
plunder
Is
it
not
better
for
us
to
return
to
Egypt
4
They
were
even
saying
to
one
another
Let
us
appoint
a
leader
and
return
to
Egypt
5
At
this
Moses
and
Aaron
fell
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
before
the
whole
assembled
congregation
of
the
Israelites
6
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
and
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
who
were
among
those
who
spied
out
the
land
ripped
their
garments
apart
7
and
they
said
this
to
all
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
The
land
that
we
passed
through
to
spy
out
is
a
very
very
good
land
8
If
Jehovah
is
pleased
with
us
he
will
certainly
bring
us
into
this
land
and
give
it
to
us
a
land
that
is
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
9
But
you
must
not
rebel
against
Jehovah
and
you
must
not
fear
the
people
of
the
land
for
we
will
devour
them
Their
protection
has
been
removed
from
them
and
Jehovah
is
with
us
Do
not
fear
them
10
However
all
the
assembly
talked
of
stoning
them
But
Jehovahs
glory
appeared
on
the
tent
of
meeting
to
all
the
people
of
Israel
11
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
How
much
longer
will
this
people
treat
me
without
respect
and
how
much
longer
will
they
not
put
faith
in
me
in
spite
of
all
the
signs
that
I
performed
among
them
12
Let
me
strike
them
with
pestilence
and
drive
them
away
and
let
me
make
you
into
a
nation
greater
and
mightier
than
they
are
13
But
Moses
said
to
Jehovah
Then
the
Egyptians
from
whose
midst
you
brought
this
people
out
by
your
power
will
hear
14
and
they
will
speak
about
it
to
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
These
also
have
heard
that
you
Jehovah
are
among
this
people
and
have
appeared
to
them
face-to-face
You
are
Jehovah
and
your
cloud
is
standing
over
them
and
you
are
going
before
them
in
the
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
and
in
the
pillar
of
fire
by
night
15
If
you
put
this
people
to
death
all
at
once
the
nations
who
have
heard
of
your
fame
would
say
this
16
Jehovah
was
not
able
to
bring
this
people
into
the
land
he
swore
to
give
them
so
he
slaughtered
them
in
the
wilderness
17
Please
now
Jehovah
let
your
power
be
great
as
you
promised
when
you
said
18
Jehovah
slow
to
anger
and
abundant
in
loyal
love
pardoning
error
and
transgression
but
he
will
by
no
means
leave
the
guilty
unpunished
bringing
punishment
for
the
error
of
fathers
upon
sons
upon
the
third
generation
and
upon
the
fourth
generation
19
Forgive
please
the
error
of
this
people
according
to
your
great
loyal
love
just
as
you
have
pardoned
this
people
from
Egypt
until
now
20
Then
Jehovah
said
I
forgive
them
according
to
your
word
21
But
on
the
other
hand
as
surely
as
I
live
all
the
earth
will
be
filled
with
the
glory
of
Jehovah
22
However
not
one
of
the
men
who
have
seen
my
glory
and
my
signs
that
I
performed
in
Egypt
and
in
the
wilderness
and
yet
have
kept
testing
me
these
ten
times
and
have
not
listened
to
my
voice
23
will
ever
see
the
land
about
which
I
swore
to
their
fathers
No
not
one
of
those
treating
me
without
respect
will
see
it
24
But
because
my
servant
Caleb
had
a
different
spirit
and
kept
following
after
me
wholeheartedly
I
will
certainly
bring
him
into
the
land
where
he
went
and
his
offspring
will
take
possession
of
it
25
Since
the
Amalekites
and
the
Canaanites
are
dwelling
in
the
valley
you
should
turn
back
tomorrow
and
set
off
for
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
Red
Sea
26
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
27
How
much
longer
will
this
evil
assembly
keep
up
this
murmuring
against
me
I
have
heard
what
the
Israelites
are
murmuring
against
me
28
Say
to
them
As
surely
as
I
live

declares
Jehovah
I
will
do
to
you
just
what
I
have
heard
you
speak
29
In
this
wilderness
your
corpses
will
fall
yes
the
whole
number
of
you
from
20
years
old
and
up
who
were
registered
all
of
you
who
have
murmured
against
me
30
None
of
you
will
enter
into
the
land
that
I
swore
to
have
you
reside
in
except
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
31
And
I
will
bring
in
your
children
who
you
said
would
become
plunder
and
they
will
get
to
know
the
land
that
you
have
rejected
32
But
your
own
corpses
will
fall
in
this
wilderness
33
Now
your
sons
will
become
shepherds
in
the
wilderness
40
years
and
they
will
have
to
answer
for
your
acts
of
unfaithfulness
until
the
last
one
of
your
corpses
falls
in
the
wilderness
34
According
to
the
number
of
the
days
that
you
spied
out
the
land
40
days
a
day
for
a
year
a
day
for
a
year
you
will
answer
for
your
errors
40
years
for
you
will
know
what
it
means
to
oppose
me
35
I
Jehovah
have
spoken
This
is
what
I
will
do
to
all
this
evil
assembly
those
who
have
gathered
together
against
me
In
this
wilderness
they
will
come
to
their
end
and
here
they
will
die
36
The
men
whom
Moses
sent
to
spy
out
the
land
and
who
caused
the
whole
assembly
to
murmur
against
him
when
they
returned
with
a
bad
report
about
the
land
37
yes
the
men
who
brought
back
the
bad
report
about
the
land
will
be
struck
down
and
die
before
Jehovah
38
But
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
and
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
who
were
among
those
who
went
to
spy
out
the
land
will
certainly
keep
living
39
When
Moses
spoke
these
words
to
all
the
Israelites
the
people
began
to
mourn
a
great
deal
40
Moreover
they
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
tried
to
go
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
saying
Here
we
are
ready
to
go
up
to
the
place
that
Jehovah
spoke
about
for
we
have
sinned
41
But
Moses
said
Why
are
you
going
beyond
the
order
of
Jehovah
This
will
not
succeed
42
Do
not
go
up
for
Jehovah
is
not
with
you
and
you
will
be
defeated
by
your
enemies
43
For
the
Amalekites
and
the
Canaanites
are
there
to
face
you
and
you
will
fall
by
the
sword
Because
you
turned
away
from
following
Jehovah
Jehovah
will
not
be
with
you
44
However
they
presumptuously
went
toward
the
top
of
the
mountain
but
the
ark
of
Jehovahs
covenant
and
Moses
did
not
move
away
from
the
middle
of
the
camp
45
Then
the
Amalekites
and
the
Canaanites
who
were
dwelling
in
that
mountain
came
down
and
struck
them
scattering
them
as
far
as
Hormah
1
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
2
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
say
to
them
When
you
eventually
come
into
the
land
that
I
am
giving
you
to
dwell
in
3
and
you
make
an
offering
by
fire
to
Jehovah
from
the
herd
or
from
the
flock—whether
a
burnt
offering
or
a
sacrifice
to
perform
a
special
vow
or
a
voluntary
offering
or
an
offering
during
your
seasonal
festivals
in
order
to
make
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah—
4
the
one
presenting
his
offering
must
also
present
to
Jehovah
a
grain
offering
of
fine
flour
a
tenth
of
an
ephah
mixed
with
a
fourth
of
a
hin
of
oil
5
You
should
also
offer
wine
as
a
drink
offering
a
fourth
of
a
hin
together
with
the
burnt
offering
or
for
the
sacrifice
of
each
male
lamb
6
Or
for
a
ram
you
should
make
a
grain
offering
of
two
tenths
of
an
ephah
measure
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
a
third
of
a
hin
of
oil
7
And
you
should
present
wine
as
a
drink
offering
a
third
of
a
hin
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
8
But
if
you
should
offer
a
male
of
the
herd
as
a
burnt
offering
or
a
sacrifice
to
perform
a
special
vow
or
communion
sacrifices
to
Jehovah
9
you
should
also
present
together
with
the
male
of
the
herd
a
grain
offering
of
three
tenths
of
an
ephah
measure
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
half
a
hin
of
oil
10
You
should
also
present
wine
as
a
drink
offering
half
a
hin
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
11
This
is
what
should
be
done
for
each
bull
or
for
each
ram
or
for
each
of
the
male
lambs
or
of
the
goats
12
Whatever
may
be
the
number
that
you
offer
that
is
what
you
should
do
for
each
one
according
to
their
number
13
This
is
how
every
native-born
Israelite
should
present
an
offering
made
by
fire
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
14
If
a
foreigner
who
is
residing
with
you
or
one
who
has
been
in
your
midst
for
many
of
your
generations
should
also
make
an
offering
by
fire
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
he
should
do
just
as
you
do
15
You
who
are
of
the
congregation
and
the
foreigner
who
is
residing
with
you
will
have
one
statute
It
will
be
a
lasting
statute
for
all
your
generations
The
foreign
resident
should
be
the
same
as
you
before
Jehovah
16
There
should
be
one
law
and
one
judicial
decision
for
you
and
for
the
foreigner
who
is
residing
with
you
17
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
to
Moses
18
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
When
you
come
into
the
land
where
I
am
bringing
you
19
and
you
eat
any
of
the
bread
of
the
land
you
should
make
a
contribution
to
Jehovah
20
You
should
make
a
contribution
of
the
firstfruits
of
your
coarse
meal
as
ring-shaped
loaves
Like
the
contribution
of
a
threshing
floor
is
the
way
you
should
contribute
it
21
Some
of
the
firstfruits
of
your
coarse
meal
you
should
give
as
a
contribution
to
Jehovah
throughout
your
generations
22
Now
if
you
make
a
mistake
and
fail
to
observe
all
these
commandments
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
to
Moses
23
all
that
Jehovah
has
commanded
you
through
Moses
from
the
day
that
Jehovah
commanded
and
onward
for
your
generations
24
and
if
it
was
done
by
mistake
and
without
the
knowledge
of
the
assembly
the
whole
assembly
must
offer
one
young
bull
as
a
burnt
offering
for
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
together
with
its
grain
offering
and
its
drink
offering
according
to
the
regular
procedure
and
one
young
goat
as
a
sin
offering
25
The
priest
will
make
atonement
for
the
whole
assembly
of
the
Israelites
and
it
will
be
forgiven
them
because
it
was
a
mistake
and
they
brought
as
their
offering
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
and
their
sin
offering
before
Jehovah
for
their
mistake
26
It
will
be
forgiven
the
whole
assembly
of
the
Israelites
and
the
foreigner
who
is
residing
in
their
midst
because
it
was
by
mistake
on
the
part
of
all
the
people
27
If
any
person
should
sin
by
mistake
then
he
must
present
a
female
goat
in
its
first
year
for
a
sin
offering
28
And
the
priest
will
make
atonement
for
the
person
who
made
a
mistake
by
an
unintentional
sin
before
Jehovah
so
as
to
make
atonement
for
it
and
it
will
be
forgiven
him
29
As
for
the
native-born
among
the
Israelites
and
the
foreigner
who
is
residing
in
their
midst
there
should
be
one
law
for
you
in
the
matter
of
doing
something
unintentionally
30
But
the
person
who
does
something
deliberately
whether
he
is
native-born
or
a
foreign
resident
is
blaspheming
Jehovah
and
must
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people
31
Because
he
has
despised
Jehovahs
word
and
broken
his
commandment
that
person
should
be
cut
off
without
fail
His
own
error
is
upon
him
32
While
the
Israelites
were
in
the
wilderness
they
found
a
man
collecting
pieces
of
wood
on
the
Sabbath
day
33
Those
who
found
him
collecting
wood
brought
him
up
to
Moses
and
Aaron
and
the
whole
assembly
34
They
committed
him
into
custody
because
it
had
not
been
specified
what
should
be
done
to
him
35
And
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
The
man
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
and
the
whole
assembly
should
stone
him
outside
the
camp
36
So
the
whole
assembly
brought
him
outside
the
camp
and
stoned
him
so
that
he
died
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
37
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
this
to
Moses
38
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
that
they
must
make
for
themselves
fringed
edges
on
the
skirts
of
their
garments
throughout
their
generations
and
they
are
to
put
a
blue
string
above
the
fringed
edge
of
the
skirt
39
You
must
have
this
fringed
edge
so
that
you
will
see
it
and
remember
all
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
and
observe
them
You
must
not
follow
your
own
hearts
and
eyes
which
are
leading
you
to
spiritual
prostitution
40
This
will
help
you
remember
and
you
will
observe
all
my
commandments
and
be
holy
to
your
God
41
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
in
order
to
prove
myself
your
God
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
1
Then
Korah
the
son
of
Izhar
the
son
of
Kohath
the
son
of
Levi
got
up
together
with
Dathan
and
Abiram
the
sons
of
Eliab
and
On
the
son
of
Peleth
of
the
sons
of
Reuben
2
They
rose
up
against
Moses
along
with
250
Israelite
men
chieftains
of
the
assembly
chosen
ones
of
the
congregation
prominent
men
3
So
they
gathered
together
against
Moses
and
Aaron
and
said
to
them
We
have
had
enough
of
you
The
whole
assembly
is
holy
all
of
them
and
Jehovah
is
in
their
midst
Why
then
should
you
exalt
yourselves
above
the
congregation
of
Jehovah
4
When
Moses
heard
this
he
at
once
fell
facedown
5
Then
he
said
to
Korah
and
to
all
his
supporters
In
the
morning
Jehovah
will
make
known
who
belongs
to
him
and
who
is
holy
and
who
should
approach
him
and
whomever
he
may
choose
will
approach
him
6
Do
this
Take
fire
holders
Korah
and
all
your
supporters
7
and
put
fire
in
them
and
place
incense
on
them
before
Jehovah
tomorrow
and
the
man
whom
Jehovah
will
choose
he
is
the
holy
one
You
sons
of
Levi
have
gone
far
enough
8
Moses
then
said
to
Korah
Listen
please
you
sons
of
Levi
9
Does
it
seem
to
you
such
a
little
thing
that
the
God
of
Israel
has
separated
you
from
the
assembly
of
Israel
and
allowed
you
to
approach
him
in
order
to
perform
the
service
of
Jehovahs
tabernacle
and
to
stand
before
the
assembly
to
minister
to
them
10
and
that
he
brought
you
near
to
him
along
with
all
your
brothers
the
sons
of
Levi
Must
you
also
try
to
secure
the
priesthood
11
For
this
reason
you
and
all
your
supporters
who
are
gathering
together
are
against
Jehovah
As
for
Aaron
who
is
he
that
you
should
murmur
against
him
12
Moses
later
sent
for
Dathan
and
Abiram
the
sons
of
Eliab
but
they
said
We
are
not
going
to
come
13
Is
it
so
little
a
thing
that
you
have
brought
us
up
out
of
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
to
put
us
to
death
in
the
wilderness
Now
do
you
also
want
to
make
yourself
an
absolute
ruler
over
us
14
As
it
is
you
have
not
brought
us
into
any
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
or
given
us
an
inheritance
of
field
and
vineyard
Would
you
bore
out
the
eyes
of
those
men
We
are
not
going
to
come
15
So
Moses
became
very
angry
and
said
to
Jehovah
Do
not
turn
to
look
at
their
grain
offering
Not
one
donkey
have
I
taken
away
from
them
nor
have
I
harmed
one
of
them
16
Then
Moses
said
to
Korah
Present
yourself
with
all
your
supporters
before
Jehovah
tomorrow
you
and
they
and
Aaron
17
Each
one
should
take
his
fire
holder
and
put
incense
on
it
and
each
will
present
his
fire
holder
before
Jehovah
250
fire
holders
together
with
you
and
Aaron
each
with
his
fire
holder
18
So
each
of
them
took
his
fire
holder
and
they
put
fire
and
incense
on
them
and
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
together
with
Moses
and
Aaron
19
When
Korah
had
gathered
his
supporters
against
them
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
Jehovahs
glory
appeared
to
all
the
assembly
20
Jehovah
now
told
Moses
and
Aaron
21
Separate
yourselves
from
among
this
group
so
that
I
may
exterminate
them
in
an
instant
22
At
this
they
fell
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
and
said
O
God
the
God
of
the
spirit
of
all
people
will
one
mans
sin
cause
you
to
become
indignant
against
the
entire
assembly
23
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
24
Speak
to
the
assembly
and
tell
them
Get
away
from
around
the
tents
of
Korah
Dathan
and
Abiram
25
Then
Moses
got
up
and
went
to
Dathan
and
Abiram
and
the
elders
of
Israel
went
with
him
26
He
told
the
assembly
Move
away
please
from
the
tents
of
these
wicked
men
and
do
not
touch
anything
that
belongs
to
them
so
that
you
may
not
be
swept
away
in
all
their
sin
27
They
immediately
moved
away
from
the
tents
of
Korah
Dathan
and
Abiram
from
every
side
and
Dathan
and
Abiram
came
out
taking
their
stand
at
the
entrance
of
their
tents
together
with
their
wives
their
sons
and
their
little
children
28
Then
Moses
said
By
this
you
will
know
that
Jehovah
has
sent
me
to
do
all
these
things
that
it
is
not
of
my
own
heart
29
If
these
people
die
a
natural
death
as
all
men
do
and
if
their
punishment
is
the
same
as
that
of
all
mankind
then
Jehovah
has
not
sent
me
30
But
if
Jehovah
does
something
extraordinary
with
them
and
the
ground
opens
and
swallows
them
and
everything
that
belongs
to
them
and
they
go
down
alive
into
the
Grave
you
will
certainly
know
that
these
men
have
treated
Jehovah
disrespectfully
31
As
soon
as
he
finished
speaking
all
these
words
the
ground
beneath
them
split
apart
32
And
the
earth
opened
and
swallowed
them
up
along
with
their
households
and
everyone
who
belonged
to
Korah
and
all
their
goods
33
So
they
and
all
who
belonged
to
them
went
down
alive
into
the
Grave
and
the
earth
covered
them
over
so
that
they
perished
from
the
midst
of
the
congregation
34
All
the
Israelites
who
were
around
them
fled
at
their
screaming
for
they
said
We
are
afraid
that
the
earth
may
swallow
us
up
35
Then
a
fire
came
out
from
Jehovah
and
consumed
the
250
men
offering
the
incense
36
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
37
Tell
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest
to
take
the
fire
holders
out
of
the
fire
for
they
are
holy
Also
tell
him
to
scatter
the
fire
some
distance
away
38
The
fire
holders
of
the
men
who
sinned
at
the
cost
of
their
lives
should
be
made
into
thin
metal
plates
to
overlay
the
altar
because
they
presented
them
before
Jehovah
and
they
became
holy
They
should
serve
as
a
sign
to
the
Israelites
39
So
Eleazar
the
priest
took
the
copper
fire
holders
that
had
been
presented
by
those
who
were
burned
up
and
beat
them
to
overlay
the
altar
40
just
as
Jehovah
had
told
him
through
Moses
It
was
a
reminder
for
the
Israelites
that
no
unauthorized
person
who
is
not
of
the
offspring
of
Aaron
should
approach
to
burn
incense
before
Jehovah
and
that
no
one
should
become
like
Korah
and
his
supporters
41
On
the
very
next
day
the
whole
assembly
of
the
Israelites
began
to
murmur
against
Moses
and
Aaron
saying
You
two
have
put
Jehovahs
people
to
death
42
When
the
assembly
had
gathered
together
against
Moses
and
Aaron
they
then
turned
toward
the
tent
of
meeting
and
look
the
cloud
covered
it
and
Jehovahs
glory
began
to
appear
43
Moses
and
Aaron
went
before
the
tent
of
meeting
44
and
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
45
You
men
remove
yourselves
from
among
this
assembly
so
that
I
may
exterminate
them
in
an
instant
At
this
they
fell
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
46
Moses
then
said
to
Aaron
Take
the
fire
holder
and
put
fire
from
the
altar
in
it
and
put
incense
on
it
and
go
quickly
to
the
assembly
and
make
atonement
for
them
because
indignation
has
gone
out
from
Jehovah
The
plague
has
started
47
Aaron
at
once
took
it
just
as
Moses
had
said
and
ran
into
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
look
the
plague
had
started
among
the
people
So
he
put
the
incense
on
the
fire
holder
and
began
making
atonement
for
the
people
48
He
kept
standing
between
the
dead
and
the
living
and
the
scourge
eventually
stopped
49
Those
who
died
from
the
scourge
amounted
to
14700
besides
those
dead
on
account
of
Korah
50
When
at
last
Aaron
returned
to
Moses
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
the
scourge
had
been
stopped
1
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
2
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
take
from
them
one
rod
for
each
paternal
house
from
the
chieftains
of
each
paternal
house
12
rods
in
all
Write
the
name
of
each
one
on
his
rod
3
You
should
write
Aarons
name
on
Levis
rod
because
there
is
one
rod
for
the
head
of
each
paternal
house
4
Deposit
the
rods
in
the
tent
of
meeting
before
the
Testimony
where
I
regularly
present
myself
to
you
5
And
the
rod
of
the
man
whom
I
choose
will
bud
and
I
will
put
a
stop
to
the
murmuring
of
the
Israelites
against
me
which
they
are
also
murmuring
against
you
6
So
Moses
spoke
to
the
Israelites
and
all
their
chieftains
gave
him
rods—a
rod
for
each
chieftain
of
a
paternal
house
12
rods—and
Aarons
rod
was
among
their
rods
7
Then
Moses
deposited
the
rods
before
Jehovah
in
the
tent
of
the
Testimony
8
On
the
next
day
when
Moses
went
into
the
tent
of
the
Testimony
look
Aarons
rod
for
the
house
of
Levi
had
budded
and
was
bringing
forth
buds
and
blossoming
flowers
and
bearing
ripe
almonds
9
Moses
then
brought
out
all
the
rods
from
before
Jehovah
to
all
the
people
of
Israel
They
looked
at
them
and
each
man
took
his
own
rod
10
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
Put
Aarons
rod
back
before
the
Testimony
as
something
to
be
kept
for
a
sign
to
the
sons
of
rebelliousness
so
that
their
murmurings
against
me
may
cease
and
so
that
they
may
not
die
11
Moses
immediately
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
He
did
just
so
12
The
Israelites
then
said
to
Moses
Now
we
will
die
we
will
surely
perish
we
are
all
going
to
perish
13
Anyone
who
even
comes
close
to
Jehovahs
tabernacle
will
die
Must
we
end
up
dying
that
way
1
Jehovah
then
said
to
Aaron
You
and
your
sons
and
your
paternal
house
with
you
will
be
answerable
for
any
error
against
the
sanctuary
and
you
and
your
sons
with
you
will
be
answerable
for
any
error
against
your
priesthood
2
Also
bring
near
your
brothers
of
the
tribe
of
Levi
your
ancestral
tribe
so
that
they
may
join
you
and
minister
to
you
and
your
sons
before
the
tent
of
the
Testimony
3
They
are
to
fulfill
their
responsibilities
to
you
and
to
the
entire
tent
However
they
must
not
come
near
the
utensils
of
the
holy
place
and
the
altar
so
that
neither
they
nor
you
may
die
4
They
will
join
you
and
carry
out
their
responsibilities
regarding
the
tent
of
meeting
and
all
the
service
of
the
tent
and
no
unauthorized
person
may
come
near
to
you
5
You
must
carry
out
your
responsibility
toward
the
holy
place
and
the
altar
so
that
no
further
indignation
may
come
against
the
people
of
Israel
6
I
myself
have
taken
your
brothers
the
Levites
from
among
the
Israelites
as
a
gift
for
you
They
are
given
to
Jehovah
to
care
for
the
service
of
the
tent
of
meeting
7
You
and
your
sons
are
responsible
for
your
priestly
duties
pertaining
to
the
altar
and
what
is
inside
the
curtain
and
you
are
to
render
this
service
I
have
given
the
service
of
the
priesthood
as
a
gift
to
you
and
any
unauthorized
person
who
approaches
should
be
put
to
death
8
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Aaron
I
myself
put
you
in
charge
of
the
contributions
made
to
me
I
have
given
to
you
and
to
your
sons
a
portion
of
all
the
holy
things
contributed
by
the
Israelites
as
a
permanent
allowance
9
This
will
be
yours
out
of
the
most
holy
offerings
made
by
fire
every
offering
they
make
including
their
grain
offerings
and
their
sin
offerings
and
their
guilt
offerings
that
they
bring
to
me
It
is
something
most
holy
for
you
and
for
your
sons
10
In
a
most
holy
place
you
should
eat
it
Every
male
may
eat
it
It
will
be
something
holy
to
you
11
This
also
belongs
to
you
the
gifts
they
contribute
together
with
all
the
wave
offerings
of
the
Israelites
I
have
given
them
to
you
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
with
you
as
a
permanent
allowance
Everyone
clean
in
your
house
may
eat
it
12
All
the
best
of
the
oil
and
all
the
best
of
the
new
wine
and
the
grain
their
firstfruits
which
they
give
to
Jehovah
I
give
them
to
you
13
The
first
ripe
fruits
of
everything
from
their
land
which
they
will
bring
to
Jehovah
will
become
yours
Everyone
clean
in
your
house
may
eat
it
14
Every
devoted
thing
in
Israel
should
become
yours
15
Every
firstborn
of
all
living
things
which
they
will
present
to
Jehovah
whether
man
or
animal
should
become
yours
However
you
should
without
fail
redeem
the
firstborn
of
mankind
and
the
firstborn
of
the
unclean
animals
you
should
redeem
16
You
should
redeem
it
with
the
redemption
price
when
it
is
a
month
old
and
up
by
the
estimated
value
of
five
silver
shekels
according
to
the
standard
shekel
of
the
holy
place
It
is
20
gerahs
17
Only
the
firstborn
bull
or
firstborn
male
lamb
or
firstborn
goat
you
should
not
redeem
They
are
something
holy
You
should
sprinkle
their
blood
on
the
altar
and
their
fat
you
should
make
smoke
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
for
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
18
And
their
flesh
should
become
yours
Like
the
breast
of
the
wave
offering
and
like
the
right
leg
it
should
become
yours
19
All
the
holy
contributions
that
the
Israelites
will
contribute
to
Jehovah
I
have
given
to
you
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
with
you
as
a
permanent
allowance
It
is
a
lasting
covenant
of
salt
before
Jehovah
for
you
and
your
offspring
with
you
20
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
to
Aaron
In
their
land
you
will
not
have
an
inheritance
and
no
portion
of
land
among
them
will
become
yours
I
am
your
portion
and
your
inheritance
in
the
midst
of
the
Israelites
21
Now
see
that
I
have
given
to
the
sons
of
Levi
every
tenth
part
in
Israel
as
an
inheritance
in
return
for
the
service
they
are
carrying
out
the
service
of
the
tent
of
meeting
22
No
longer
may
the
people
of
Israel
approach
the
tent
of
meeting
or
else
they
will
incur
sin
and
die
23
The
Levites
themselves
are
to
carry
out
the
service
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
they
are
the
ones
who
will
answer
for
their
error
It
is
a
lasting
statute
during
all
your
generations
that
they
should
not
take
possession
of
an
inheritance
among
the
Israelites
24
For
I
have
given
to
the
Levites
as
an
inheritance
the
tenth
part
contributed
by
the
people
of
Israel
which
they
will
contribute
to
Jehovah
That
is
why
I
have
said
to
them
In
the
midst
of
the
Israelites
they
should
not
take
possession
of
an
inheritance
25
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
26
You
should
tell
the
Levites
You
will
receive
from
the
Israelites
the
tenth
part
that
I
have
given
to
you
from
them
for
your
inheritance
and
you
should
contribute
from
it
a
tenth
part
of
the
tenth
part
as
a
contribution
to
Jehovah
27
And
it
will
be
considered
your
contribution
as
though
it
were
the
grain
of
the
threshing
floor
or
the
full
production
of
the
winepress
or
oil
press
28
In
this
way
you
will
also
give
a
contribution
to
Jehovah
from
all
the
tenth
parts
that
you
receive
from
the
Israelites
and
from
them
you
are
to
give
the
contribution
for
Jehovah
to
Aaron
the
priest
29
You
will
make
every
sort
of
contribution
to
Jehovah
from
the
very
best
of
all
the
gifts
given
to
you
as
something
holy
30
And
you
must
say
to
them
When
you
contribute
the
best
of
them
then
it
will
be
considered
for
the
Levites
as
the
produce
of
the
threshing
floor
and
as
the
produce
of
the
winepress
or
oil
press
31
You
and
your
household
may
eat
it
in
any
place
because
it
is
your
wages
in
return
for
your
service
at
the
tent
of
meeting
32
You
will
not
incur
sin
in
this
as
long
as
you
contribute
the
best
from
them
and
you
must
not
profane
the
holy
things
of
the
Israelites
or
you
will
die
1
Jehovah
spoke
again
to
Moses
and
Aaron
saying
2
This
is
a
statute
of
the
law
that
Jehovah
has
commanded
Tell
the
Israelites
that
they
should
take
for
you
a
sound
red
cow
in
which
there
is
no
defect
and
upon
which
no
yoke
has
come
3
You
are
to
give
it
to
Eleazar
the
priest
and
he
will
lead
it
outside
the
camp
and
it
will
be
slaughtered
before
him
4
Then
Eleazar
the
priest
will
take
some
of
its
blood
with
his
finger
and
spatter
its
blood
seven
times
straight
toward
the
front
of
the
tent
of
meeting
5
The
cow
will
then
be
burned
before
his
eyes
Its
skin
and
its
flesh
and
its
blood
together
with
its
dung
will
be
burned
6
And
the
priest
will
take
cedarwood
hyssop
and
scarlet
material
and
throw
them
into
the
fire
where
the
cow
is
being
burned
7
The
priest
will
then
wash
his
garments
and
bathe
himself
in
water
and
afterward
he
may
come
into
the
camp
but
the
priest
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
8
The
one
who
burned
the
cow
will
wash
his
garments
in
water
and
bathe
himself
in
water
and
he
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
9
A
clean
man
will
gather
up
the
ashes
of
the
cow
and
deposit
them
outside
the
camp
in
a
clean
place
and
they
should
be
kept
by
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
to
prepare
water
that
will
be
used
for
cleansing
It
is
a
sin
offering
10
The
one
gathering
the
ashes
of
the
cow
will
wash
his
garments
and
be
unclean
until
the
evening
This
will
serve
the
Israelites
and
the
foreigner
who
is
residing
in
their
midst
as
a
lasting
statute
11
Anyone
touching
any
dead
person
will
be
unclean
for
seven
days
12
Such
one
should
purify
himself
with
the
water
on
the
third
day
and
on
the
seventh
day
he
will
be
clean
But
if
he
does
not
purify
himself
on
the
third
day
on
the
seventh
day
he
will
not
be
clean
13
Everyone
who
touches
the
corpse
of
any
dead
person
and
does
not
purify
himself
has
defiled
Jehovahs
tabernacle
and
that
person
must
be
cut
off
from
Israel
Because
the
water
for
cleansing
has
not
been
sprinkled
on
him
he
continues
unclean
His
uncleanness
remains
upon
him
14
This
is
the
law
that
applies
when
a
man
dies
in
a
tent
Everyone
who
enters
the
tent
and
everyone
who
was
already
in
the
tent
will
be
unclean
for
seven
days
15
Every
opened
container
with
no
lid
tied
on
it
is
unclean
16
Everyone
in
the
open
field
who
touches
someone
killed
with
the
sword
or
a
corpse
or
the
bone
of
a
man
or
a
burial
place
will
be
unclean
for
seven
days
17
They
should
take
for
the
unclean
one
some
of
the
ashes
of
the
sin
offering
that
was
burned
and
pour
running
water
on
them
in
a
container
18
Then
a
clean
man
will
take
hyssop
and
dip
it
into
the
water
and
spatter
it
on
the
tent
and
on
all
the
containers
and
on
the
people
who
were
there
and
on
the
one
who
touched
the
bone
or
the
slain
one
or
the
corpse
or
the
burial
place
19
The
clean
person
will
spatter
it
on
the
unclean
one
on
the
third
day
and
on
the
seventh
day
and
he
will
purify
him
from
sin
on
the
seventh
day
then
he
should
wash
his
garments
and
bathe
in
water
and
he
will
become
clean
in
the
evening
20
But
the
man
who
is
unclean
and
who
will
not
purify
himself
that
person
must
be
cut
off
from
the
congregation
because
he
has
defiled
Jehovahs
sanctuary
The
water
for
cleansing
was
not
sprinkled
on
him
so
he
is
unclean
21
This
will
serve
as
a
lasting
statute
for
them
The
one
spattering
the
water
for
cleansing
should
wash
his
garments
and
the
one
touching
the
water
for
cleansing
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
22
Anything
the
unclean
one
touches
will
be
unclean
and
the
person
who
touches
it
will
be
unclean
until
the
evening
1
In
the
first
month
the
entire
assembly
of
the
Israelites
came
into
the
wilderness
of
Zin
and
the
people
began
dwelling
in
Kadesh
It
was
there
that
Miriam
died
and
was
buried
2
Now
there
was
no
water
for
the
assembly
and
they
gathered
together
against
Moses
and
Aaron
3
The
people
were
quarreling
with
Moses
saying
If
only
we
had
died
when
our
brothers
died
before
Jehovah
4
Why
have
you
brought
Jehovahs
congregation
into
this
wilderness
for
us
and
our
livestock
to
die
here
5
And
why
have
you
led
us
up
out
of
Egypt
to
bring
us
into
this
evil
place
It
is
no
place
for
seed
and
figs
and
vines
and
pomegranates
and
there
is
no
water
to
drink
6
Then
Moses
and
Aaron
came
from
before
the
congregation
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
fell
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
and
Jehovahs
glory
began
to
appear
to
them
7
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
8
Take
the
rod
and
call
the
assembly
together
you
and
Aaron
your
brother
and
speak
to
the
crag
before
their
eyes
that
it
may
give
its
water
and
you
will
bring
out
water
for
them
from
the
crag
and
give
the
assembly
and
their
livestock
something
to
drink
9
So
Moses
took
the
rod
from
before
Jehovah
just
as
He
had
commanded
him
10
Then
Moses
and
Aaron
called
the
congregation
together
before
the
crag
and
he
said
to
them
Hear
now
you
rebels
Must
we
bring
out
water
for
you
from
this
crag
11
With
that
Moses
lifted
his
hand
up
and
struck
the
crag
twice
with
his
rod
and
much
water
began
to
pour
out
and
the
assembly
and
their
livestock
began
to
drink
12
Jehovah
later
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
Because
you
did
not
show
faith
in
me
and
sanctify
me
before
the
eyes
of
the
people
of
Israel
you
will
not
bring
this
congregation
into
the
land
that
I
will
give
them
13
These
are
the
waters
of
Meribah
where
the
Israelites
quarreled
with
Jehovah
so
that
he
was
sanctified
among
them
14
Then
Moses
sent
messengers
from
Kadesh
to
the
king
of
Edom
This
is
what
your
brother
Israel
says
You
well
know
all
the
hardship
that
we
have
experienced
15
Our
fathers
went
to
Egypt
and
we
dwelled
in
Egypt
many
years
and
the
Egyptians
mistreated
us
and
our
fathers
16
Finally
we
cried
out
to
Jehovah
and
he
heard
us
and
sent
an
angel
and
brought
us
out
of
Egypt
and
here
we
are
in
Kadesh
a
city
on
the
border
of
your
territory
17
Please
let
us
pass
through
your
land
We
will
not
pass
through
any
field
or
vineyard
and
we
will
not
drink
the
water
of
any
well
We
will
march
on
the
Kings
Road
without
turning
to
the
right
or
the
left
until
we
pass
through
your
territory
18
However
Edom
said
to
him
You
may
not
pass
through
our
territory
If
you
do
I
will
come
out
with
the
sword
to
meet
you
19
In
turn
the
Israelites
said
to
him
By
the
highway
we
will
go
up
and
if
we
and
our
livestock
drink
your
water
we
will
pay
for
it
We
want
nothing
more
than
to
pass
through
on
foot
20
Still
he
said
You
may
not
pass
through
With
that
Edom
came
out
to
encounter
him
with
many
people
and
a
strong
army
21
So
Edom
refused
to
allow
Israel
to
pass
through
his
territory
therefore
Israel
turned
away
from
him
22
The
people
of
Israel
the
entire
assembly
departed
from
Kadesh
and
came
to
Mount
Hor
23
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
and
Aaron
in
Mount
Hor
by
the
border
of
the
land
of
Edom
24
Aaron
will
be
gathered
to
his
people
He
will
not
enter
the
land
that
I
will
give
to
the
Israelites
because
you
both
rebelled
against
my
order
regarding
the
waters
of
Meribah
25
Take
Aaron
and
his
son
Eleazar
and
bring
them
up
into
Mount
Hor
26
Remove
Aarons
garments
and
clothe
Eleazar
his
son
with
them
and
Aaron
will
die
there
27
So
Moses
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
and
they
climbed
Mount
Hor
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
assembly
28
Then
Moses
removed
Aarons
garments
and
clothed
Eleazar
his
son
with
them
After
that
Aaron
died
there
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
And
Moses
and
Eleazar
came
down
from
the
mountain
29
When
all
the
assembly
saw
that
Aaron
had
died
the
entire
house
of
Israel
wept
for
Aaron
for
30
days
1
When
the
Canaanite
king
of
Arad
who
dwelled
in
the
Negeb
heard
that
Israel
had
come
by
the
way
of
Atharim
he
attacked
Israel
and
carried
away
some
of
them
as
captives
2
So
Israel
made
this
vow
to
Jehovah
If
you
give
this
people
into
my
hand
I
will
without
fail
devote
their
cities
to
destruction
3
So
Jehovah
listened
to
Israels
voice
and
gave
the
Canaanites
over
to
them
and
they
devoted
them
and
their
cities
to
destruction
Therefore
they
named
the
place
Hormah
4
As
they
continued
their
journey
from
Mount
Hor
by
the
way
of
the
Red
Sea
in
order
to
go
around
the
land
of
Edom
the
people
became
weary
of
the
journey
5
And
the
people
kept
speaking
against
God
and
Moses
saying
Why
have
you
brought
us
up
out
of
Egypt
to
die
in
the
wilderness
There
is
no
food
and
no
water
and
we
have
come
to
hate
this
contemptible
bread
6
So
Jehovah
sent
poisonous
serpents
among
the
people
and
they
kept
biting
the
people
so
that
many
Israelites
died
7
So
the
people
came
to
Moses
and
said
We
have
sinned
by
speaking
against
Jehovah
and
against
you
Intercede
with
Jehovah
so
that
he
may
remove
the
serpents
from
us
And
Moses
interceded
on
behalf
of
the
people
8
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Make
a
replica
of
a
poisonous
snake
and
put
it
on
a
pole
Then
when
anyone
has
been
bitten
he
will
have
to
look
at
it
in
order
to
keep
alive
9
Moses
at
once
made
a
serpent
of
copper
and
put
it
on
the
pole
and
whenever
a
serpent
had
bitten
a
man
and
he
looked
at
the
copper
serpent
he
survived
10
After
that
the
Israelites
departed
and
camped
in
Oboth
11
Then
they
departed
from
Oboth
and
camped
in
Iye-abarim
in
the
wilderness
that
faces
Moab
toward
the
east
12
From
there
they
departed
and
camped
by
the
Valley
of
Zered
13
From
there
they
departed
and
camped
in
the
region
of
the
Arnon
which
is
in
the
wilderness
that
extends
from
the
border
of
the
Amorites
for
the
Arnon
is
the
boundary
of
Moab
between
Moab
and
the
Amorites
14
That
is
why
the
book
of
the
Wars
of
Jehovah
speaks
of
Vaheb
in
Suphah
and
the
valleys
of
Arnon
15
and
the
descent
of
the
valleys
which
extends
toward
the
settlement
of
Ar
and
adjoins
the
border
of
Moab
16
Next
they
went
on
to
Beer
This
is
the
well
about
which
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Gather
the
people
and
let
me
give
them
water
17
At
that
time
Israel
sang
this
song
Spring
up
O
well—Respond
to
it
18
The
well
that
princes
dug
that
nobles
of
the
people
excavated
With
a
commanders
staff
and
with
their
own
staffs
Then
they
went
from
the
wilderness
on
to
Mattanah
19
from
Mattanah
on
to
Nahaliel
and
from
Nahaliel
on
to
Bamoth
20
They
went
from
Bamoth
on
to
the
valley
that
is
in
the
territory
of
Moab
on
top
of
Pisgah
which
overlooks
Jeshimon
21
Israel
now
sent
messengers
to
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites
saying
22
Let
us
pass
through
your
land
We
will
not
turn
aside
into
a
field
or
a
vineyard
We
will
not
drink
water
from
any
well
We
will
march
on
the
Kings
Road
until
we
pass
through
your
territory
23
But
Sihon
did
not
allow
Israel
to
pass
through
his
territory
Instead
Sihon
gathered
all
his
people
and
went
out
against
Israel
in
the
wilderness
and
came
to
Jahaz
and
began
fighting
with
Israel
24
But
Israel
defeated
him
with
the
sword
and
took
possession
of
his
land
from
the
Arnon
to
the
Jabbok
near
the
Ammonites
because
Jazer
borders
the
territory
of
the
Ammonites
25
So
Israel
took
all
these
cities
and
they
began
dwelling
in
all
the
cities
of
the
Amorites
in
Heshbon
and
all
its
dependent
towns
26
For
Heshbon
was
the
city
of
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites
who
had
fought
with
the
king
of
Moab
and
taken
all
his
land
from
him
as
far
as
the
Arnon
27
That
is
what
gave
rise
to
the
taunting
proverbial
saying
Come
to
Heshbon
Let
the
city
of
Sihon
be
built
and
firmly
established
28
For
a
fire
came
out
of
Heshbon
a
flame
from
the
town
of
Sihon
It
has
consumed
Ar
of
Moab
the
lords
of
the
high
places
of
the
Arnon
29
Woe
to
you
Moab
You
will
be
destroyed
O
people
of
Chemosh
He
makes
his
sons
fugitives
and
his
daughters
captives
of
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites
30
Let
us
shoot
at
them
Heshbon
will
be
destroyed
as
far
as
Dibon
Let
us
desolate
it
as
far
as
Nophah
Fire
will
spread
as
far
as
Medeba
31
So
Israel
began
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
Amorites
32
Moses
then
sent
some
men
to
spy
on
Jazer
They
captured
its
dependent
towns
and
drove
out
the
Amorites
who
were
there
33
After
that
they
turned
and
went
up
by
way
of
Bashan
And
Og
the
king
of
Bashan
came
out
with
all
his
people
to
meet
them
in
battle
at
Edrei
34
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Do
not
be
afraid
of
him
for
I
will
give
him
and
all
his
people
and
his
land
into
your
hand
and
you
will
do
to
him
just
as
you
did
to
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites
who
lived
in
Heshbon
35
So
they
kept
striking
him
down
along
with
his
sons
and
all
his
people
until
none
of
his
people
survived
and
they
took
possession
of
his
land
1
Then
the
Israelites
departed
and
camped
on
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
across
the
Jordan
from
Jericho
2
Now
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor
saw
all
that
Israel
had
done
to
the
Amorites
3
and
Moab
became
very
frightened
of
the
people
because
they
were
so
many
indeed
Moab
felt
sick
with
fear
because
of
the
Israelites
4
So
Moab
said
to
the
elders
of
Midian
Now
this
congregation
will
devour
all
our
surroundings
just
as
a
bull
devours
the
grass
in
the
field
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor
was
king
of
Moab
at
that
time
5
He
sent
messengers
to
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
at
Pethor
which
is
by
the
River
in
his
native
land
He
summoned
him
saying
Look
A
people
has
come
out
of
Egypt
Look
They
have
covered
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
are
dwelling
right
in
front
of
me
6
Now
please
come
and
curse
this
people
for
me
for
they
are
mightier
than
I
am
Perhaps
I
can
defeat
them
and
drive
them
out
of
the
land
for
I
well
know
that
the
one
whom
you
bless
is
blessed
and
the
one
whom
you
curse
is
cursed
7
So
the
elders
of
Moab
and
the
elders
of
Midian
traveled
with
the
fee
for
divination
in
their
hands
and
went
to
Balaam
and
conveyed
to
him
Balaks
message
8
At
that
he
said
to
them
Spend
the
night
here
and
I
will
bring
back
to
you
whatever
word
Jehovah
speaks
to
me
So
the
princes
of
Moab
stayed
with
Balaam
9
Then
God
came
to
Balaam
and
said
Who
are
these
men
with
you
10
Balaam
said
to
the
true
God
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor
the
king
of
Moab
has
sent
me
a
message
saying
11
Look
The
people
who
are
coming
out
of
Egypt
are
covering
the
face
of
the
earth
Now
come
and
put
a
curse
on
them
for
me
Perhaps
I
may
be
able
to
fight
against
them
and
drive
them
out
12
But
God
said
to
Balaam
You
must
not
go
with
them
You
must
not
curse
the
people
for
they
are
blessed
13
Balaam
got
up
in
the
morning
and
said
to
the
princes
of
Balak
Go
to
your
land
for
Jehovah
has
refused
to
let
me
go
with
you
14
So
the
princes
of
Moab
departed
and
returned
to
Balak
and
said
Balaam
has
refused
to
come
with
us
15
However
Balak
again
sent
princes
more
numerous
and
more
distinguished
than
the
first
group
16
They
came
to
Balaam
and
said
to
him
This
is
what
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor
has
said
Please
do
not
let
anything
hinder
you
from
coming
to
me
17
for
I
will
honor
you
greatly
and
I
will
do
anything
you
tell
me
to
do
So
come
please
and
curse
this
people
for
me
18
But
Balaam
answered
the
servants
of
Balak
If
Balak
were
to
give
me
his
own
house
full
of
silver
and
gold
I
could
not
do
anything
beyond
the
order
of
Jehovah
my
God
whether
small
or
great
19
But
please
stay
here
tonight
also
so
that
I
may
learn
what
else
Jehovah
will
tell
me
20
Then
God
came
to
Balaam
by
night
and
said
to
him
If
these
men
have
come
to
summon
you
go
along
with
them
But
you
may
speak
only
the
words
that
I
tell
you
to
say
21
So
Balaam
got
up
in
the
morning
and
saddled
his
donkey
and
went
with
the
princes
of
Moab
22
But
Gods
anger
blazed
because
he
was
going
and
Jehovahs
angel
stationed
himself
in
the
road
to
resist
him
Now
Balaam
was
riding
on
his
donkey
and
two
of
his
attendants
were
with
him
23
And
when
the
donkey
saw
Jehovahs
angel
standing
in
the
road
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
it
tried
to
turn
off
the
road
into
the
field
But
Balaam
began
to
beat
the
donkey
to
make
it
return
to
the
road
24
Then
Jehovahs
angel
stood
in
a
narrow
path
between
two
vineyards
with
stone
walls
on
both
sides
25
When
the
donkey
saw
Jehovahs
angel
it
began
to
squeeze
itself
against
the
wall
and
it
jammed
Balaams
foot
against
the
wall
and
Balaam
began
beating
it
again
26
Jehovahs
angel
now
passed
by
again
and
stood
in
a
narrow
place
where
there
was
no
way
to
turn
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
27
When
the
donkey
saw
Jehovahs
angel
it
lay
down
under
Balaam
so
Balaam
became
furious
and
kept
beating
the
donkey
with
his
staff
28
Finally
Jehovah
caused
the
donkey
to
speak
and
it
said
to
Balaam
What
have
I
done
to
you
to
make
you
beat
me
these
three
times
29
Balaam
replied
to
the
donkey
It
is
because
you
have
made
a
fool
of
me
If
only
I
had
a
sword
in
my
hand
I
would
kill
you
30
Then
the
donkey
said
to
Balaam
Am
I
not
your
donkey
that
you
have
ridden
on
all
your
life
until
today
Have
I
ever
treated
you
this
way
before
He
replied
No
31
Then
Jehovah
uncovered
Balaams
eyes
and
he
saw
Jehovahs
angel
standing
in
the
road
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
At
once
he
bowed
low
and
prostrated
himself
on
his
face
32
Then
Jehovahs
angel
said
to
him
Why
have
you
beaten
your
donkey
these
three
times
Look
I
myself
came
out
to
offer
resistance
because
your
way
is
in
defiance
of
my
will
33
The
donkey
saw
me
and
tried
to
turn
away
from
me
these
three
times
Supposing
it
had
not
turned
away
from
me
By
now
I
would
have
killed
you
and
let
the
donkey
live
34
Balaam
said
to
Jehovahs
angel
I
have
sinned
because
I
did
not
know
that
it
was
you
standing
in
the
road
to
meet
me
And
now
if
it
is
bad
in
your
eyes
I
will
go
back
35
But
Jehovahs
angel
said
to
Balaam
Go
with
the
men
but
you
may
speak
only
the
words
that
I
tell
you
So
Balaam
continued
going
with
the
princes
of
Balak
36
When
Balak
heard
that
Balaam
had
come
he
immediately
went
out
to
meet
him
at
the
city
of
Moab
which
is
on
the
bank
of
the
Arnon
on
the
border
of
the
territory
37
Balak
said
to
Balaam
Did
I
not
send
for
you
Why
did
you
not
come
to
me
Did
you
think
I
am
not
able
to
honor
you
greatly
38
Balaam
replied
to
Balak
Well
I
have
come
to
you
now
But
will
I
be
allowed
to
say
anything
I
can
only
speak
words
that
God
puts
in
my
mouth
39
So
Balaam
went
with
Balak
and
they
came
to
Kiriath-huzoth
40
Balak
sacrificed
cattle
and
sheep
and
sent
some
to
Balaam
and
the
princes
who
were
with
him
41
In
the
morning
Balak
took
Balaam
and
brought
him
up
to
Bamoth-baal
from
there
he
could
see
all
the
people
1
Then
Balaam
said
to
Balak
Build
on
this
spot
seven
altars
and
prepare
seven
bulls
and
seven
rams
for
me
2
Balak
immediately
did
just
as
Balaam
had
said
And
Balak
and
Balaam
offered
up
a
bull
and
a
ram
on
each
altar
3
Balaam
then
said
to
Balak
Stay
here
by
your
burnt
offering
and
I
will
go
Perhaps
Jehovah
will
get
in
touch
with
me
Whatever
he
reveals
to
me
I
will
tell
you
So
he
went
to
a
barren
hill
4
Then
God
got
in
touch
with
Balaam
who
said
to
Him
I
set
the
seven
altars
in
rows
and
I
offered
up
a
bull
and
a
ram
on
each
altar
5
Jehovah
put
this
word
in
the
mouth
of
Balaam
Return
to
Balak
and
this
is
what
you
are
to
say
6
So
he
returned
and
saw
that
Balak
and
all
the
princes
of
Moab
were
standing
by
his
burnt
offering
7
Then
he
spoke
this
proverbial
saying
Balak
the
king
of
Moab
has
brought
me
from
Aram
From
the
mountains
of
the
east
Do
come
to
curse
Jacob
for
me
Yes
come
to
denounce
Israel

8
How
could
I
put
a
curse
on
those
whom
God
has
not
cursed
And
how
could
I
denounce
those
whom
Jehovah
has
not
denounced

9
From
the
top
of
the
rocks
I
see
them
And
from
the
hills
I
see
them
As
a
people
they
dwell
there
alone
They
do
not
count
themselves
among
the
nations
10
Who
can
number
the
dust
particles
of
JacobOr
count
even
the
fourth
part
of
Israel
Let
me
die
the
death
of
the
upright
And
let
my
end
be
like
theirs
11
Balak
then
said
to
Balaam
What
have
you
done
to
me
I
brought
you
to
put
a
curse
on
my
enemies
and
here
you
have
done
nothing
but
bless
them
12
He
answered
Must
I
not
speak
whatever
Jehovah
puts
in
my
mouth
13
Balak
said
to
him
Please
come
with
me
to
another
place
from
which
you
can
see
them
You
will
see
only
a
part
of
them
you
will
not
see
them
all
Put
a
curse
on
them
for
me
from
there
14
So
he
took
him
to
the
field
of
Zophim
to
the
top
of
Pisgah
and
built
seven
altars
and
offered
up
a
bull
and
a
ram
on
each
altar
15
So
Balaam
said
to
Balak
Stay
here
by
your
burnt
offering
while
I
get
in
touch
with
Him
over
there
16
And
Jehovah
got
in
touch
with
Balaam
and
put
this
word
in
his
mouth
Return
to
Balak
and
this
is
what
you
are
to
say
17
So
he
came
to
him
and
saw
that
he
was
waiting
by
his
burnt
offering
and
the
princes
of
Moab
were
with
him
Balak
asked
him
What
has
Jehovah
said
18
Then
he
spoke
this
proverbial
saying
Get
up
Balak
and
listen
Hear
me
O
son
of
Zippor
19
God
is
not
a
mere
man
who
tells
lies
Nor
a
son
of
man
who
changes
his
mind
When
he
says
something
will
he
not
do
it
When
he
speaks
will
he
not
carry
it
out
20
Look
I
have
been
taken
to
bless
Now
He
has
blessed
and
I
cannot
reverse
it
21
He
does
not
tolerate
any
magical
power
against
Jacob
And
he
does
not
allow
any
trouble
against
Israel
Jehovah
his
God
is
with
them
And
he
is
loudly
hailed
as
king
among
them
22
God
is
bringing
them
out
of
Egypt
He
is
like
the
horns
of
a
wild
bull
for
them
23
For
there
are
no
omens
of
doom
against
Jacob
Nor
any
divination
against
Israel
At
this
time
it
may
be
said
about
Jacob
and
Israel
Look
at
what
God
has
done
24
Here
is
a
people
who
will
rise
up
like
a
lion
And
like
the
lion
it
will
raise
itself
up
It
will
not
lie
down
until
it
eats
preyAnd
drinks
the
blood
of
the
slain
ones
25
Balak
then
said
to
Balaam
If
on
the
one
hand
you
cannot
put
any
curse
on
him
then
on
the
other
hand
you
should
not
bless
him
either
26
Balaam
answered
Balak
Did
I
not
say
to
you
I
will
do
all
that
Jehovah
says
27
Balak
said
to
Balaam
Please
come
and
let
me
take
you
to
yet
another
place
Perhaps
it
will
be
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
true
God
for
you
to
put
a
curse
on
him
for
me
from
there
28
So
Balak
took
Balaam
to
the
top
of
Peor
which
looks
toward
Jeshimon
29
Then
Balaam
said
to
Balak
Build
seven
altars
on
this
spot
and
prepare
seven
bulls
and
seven
rams
for
me
30
So
Balak
did
just
as
Balaam
had
said
and
he
offered
up
a
bull
and
a
ram
on
each
altar
1
When
Balaam
saw
that
it
pleased
Jehovah
to
bless
Israel
he
did
not
go
away
again
to
search
for
omens
of
doom
but
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wilderness
2
When
Balaam
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
Israel
encamped
by
his
tribes
then
the
spirit
of
God
came
upon
him
3
He
then
spoke
this
proverbial
saying
The
saying
of
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
And
the
saying
of
a
man
whose
eyes
have
been
opened
4
The
saying
of
the
one
hearing
the
word
of
God
Who
saw
a
vision
of
the
Almighty
Who
has
bowed
down
with
his
eyes
uncovered

5
How
beautiful
are
your
tents
O
Jacob
Your
tabernacles
O
Israel

6
Like
the
valleys
they
have
extended
a
long
way
Like
gardens
by
the
river
Like
aloes
that
Jehovah
has
planted
Like
cedars
by
the
waters

7
Water
keeps
trickling
from
his
two
leather
buckets
And
his
seed
is
sown
by
many
waters
His
king
also
will
be
greater
than
Agag
And
his
kingdom
will
be
exalted

8
God
is
bringing
him
out
of
Egypt
He
is
like
the
horns
of
a
wild
bull
for
them
He
will
consume
the
nations
his
oppressors
And
their
bones
he
will
gnaw
and
he
will
shatter
them
with
his
arrows

9
He
has
crouched
down
he
has
lain
down
like
the
lion
And
like
a
lion
who
dares
rouse
him
Those
blessing
you
are
blessed
And
those
cursing
you
are
cursed
10
Then
Balak
became
furious
with
Balaam
Balak
scornfully
clapped
his
hands
together
and
said
to
Balaam
It
was
to
put
a
curse
on
my
enemies
that
I
called
you
but
now
you
have
done
nothing
but
bless
them
these
three
times
11
Now
go
home
immediately
I
intended
to
honor
you
greatly
but
look
Jehovah
has
deprived
you
of
honor
12
Balaam
replied
to
Balak
Did
I
not
say
to
the
messengers
you
sent
13
If
Balak
were
to
give
me
his
house
full
of
silver
and
gold
I
could
not
of
my
own
will
do
anything
beyond
the
order
of
Jehovah
whether
good
or
bad
I
will
only
speak
what
Jehovah
will
tell
me
14
And
now
I
am
going
away
to
my
people
Come
and
let
me
advise
you
what
this
people
will
do
to
your
people
in
the
future
15
So
he
spoke
this
proverbial
saying
The
saying
of
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
And
the
saying
of
a
man
whose
eyes
have
been
opened
16
The
saying
of
the
one
hearing
the
word
of
God
And
the
one
having
the
knowledge
of
the
Most
High
A
vision
of
the
Almighty
he
sawWhile
bowing
down
with
his
eyes
uncovered
17
I
will
see
him
but
not
now
I
will
behold
him
but
not
soon
A
star
will
come
out
of
Jacob
And
a
scepter
will
rise
out
of
Israel
And
he
will
certainly
break
apart
the
forehead
of
MoabAnd
the
skull
of
all
the
sons
of
tumult
18
And
Edom
will
become
a
possession
Yes
Seir
the
possession
of
his
enemies
While
Israel
is
displaying
his
courage
19
And
out
of
Jacob
one
will
be
subduing
And
he
will
destroy
any
survivor
from
the
city
20
When
he
saw
Amalek
he
continued
his
proverbial
saying
Amalek
was
the
first
of
the
nations
But
in
the
end
he
will
perish
21
When
he
saw
the
Kenites
he
continued
his
proverbial
saying
Secure
is
your
dwelling
and
set
on
the
crag
is
your
abode
22
But
someone
will
burn
Kain
down
How
long
before
Assyria
carries
you
away
captive
23
And
he
continued
his
proverbial
saying
Woe
Who
will
survive
when
God
does
this
24
Ships
will
come
from
the
coast
of
Kittim
And
they
will
afflict
Assyria
And
they
will
afflict
Eber
But
he
too
will
utterly
perish
25
Then
Balaam
got
up
and
went
and
returned
to
his
place
Balak
also
went
his
own
way
1
When
Israel
was
dwelling
in
Shittim
the
people
started
to
commit
sexual
immorality
with
the
daughters
of
Moab
2
The
women
invited
the
people
to
the
sacrifices
of
their
gods
and
the
people
began
to
eat
and
to
bow
down
to
their
gods
3
So
Israel
joined
in
worship
of
the
Baal
of
Peor
and
Jehovah
became
enraged
with
Israel
4
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Take
all
the
leaders
of
these
people
and
hang
them
up
before
Jehovah
in
broad
daylight
that
the
burning
anger
of
Jehovah
may
turn
back
from
Israel
5
Then
Moses
said
to
the
judges
of
Israel
Each
one
of
you
should
kill
his
men
who
joined
in
worship
of
the
Baal
of
Peor
6
But
just
then
there
came
one
of
the
Israelites
bringing
near
to
his
brothers
a
Midianite
woman
before
the
eyes
of
Moses
and
of
all
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
while
they
were
weeping
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
7
When
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest
saw
it
he
immediately
rose
up
from
the
midst
of
the
assembly
and
took
a
spear
in
his
hand
8
Then
he
went
after
the
man
of
Israel
into
the
tent
and
pierced
both
of
them
through
the
man
of
Israel
and
the
woman
through
her
genital
parts
At
that
the
scourge
on
the
Israelites
was
halted
9
Those
who
died
from
the
scourge
amounted
to
24000
10
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
11
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest
has
turned
my
wrath
away
from
the
people
of
Israel
because
he
tolerated
no
rivalry
at
all
toward
me
among
them
So
I
have
not
exterminated
the
Israelites
in
my
insistence
on
exclusive
devotion
12
Therefore
say
I
am
giving
him
my
covenant
of
peace
13
And
it
will
serve
as
the
covenant
of
a
lasting
priesthood
for
him
and
his
offspring
after
him
because
he
tolerated
no
rivalry
toward
his
God
and
he
made
atonement
for
the
people
of
Israel
14
Incidentally
the
name
of
the
Israelite
man
who
was
put
to
death
along
with
the
Midianitess
was
Zimri
the
son
of
Salu
a
chieftain
of
a
paternal
house
of
the
Simeonites
15
The
name
of
the
Midianite
woman
who
was
put
to
death
was
Cozbi
the
daughter
of
Zur
he
was
a
leader
of
the
clans
of
a
paternal
house
in
Midian
16
Jehovah
later
said
to
Moses
17
Harass
the
Midianites
and
strike
them
down
18
because
they
have
been
harassing
you
with
their
cunning
dealings
against
you
in
the
affair
of
Peor
and
of
Cozbi
the
daughter
of
a
chieftain
of
Midian
their
sister
who
was
put
to
death
in
the
day
of
the
scourge
over
the
affair
of
Peor
1
After
the
scourge
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
the
priest
2
Take
a
census
of
the
whole
assembly
of
the
Israelites
from
20
years
of
age
and
up
by
their
paternal
houses
counting
all
those
who
can
serve
in
the
army
in
Israel
3
So
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
spoke
with
them
in
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
by
the
Jordan
at
Jericho
saying
4
Take
a
census
of
them
from
the
age
of
20
years
and
up
just
as
Jehovah
commanded
Moses
Now
the
sons
of
Israel
who
went
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
were
5
Reuben
Israels
firstborn
Reubens
sons
were
of
Hanoch
the
family
of
the
Hanochites
of
Pallu
the
family
of
the
Palluites
6
of
Hezron
the
family
of
the
Hezronites
of
Carmi
the
family
of
the
Carmites
7
These
were
the
families
of
the
Reubenites
and
their
registered
ones
amounted
to
43730
8
The
son
of
Pallu
was
Eliab
9
And
the
sons
of
Eliab
were
Nemuel
Dathan
and
Abiram
This
Dathan
and
Abiram
were
chosen
ones
of
the
assembly
who
fought
against
Moses
and
Aaron
along
with
Korahs
group
when
they
fought
against
Jehovah
10
Then
the
earth
opened
and
swallowed
them
up
As
for
Korah
he
died
with
his
supporters
when
the
fire
consumed
250
men
And
they
became
a
warning
example
11
However
the
sons
of
Korah
did
not
die
12
The
sons
of
Simeon
by
their
families
were
of
Nemuel
the
family
of
the
Nemuelites
of
Jamin
the
family
of
the
Jaminites
of
Jachin
the
family
of
the
Jachinites
13
of
Zerah
the
family
of
the
Zerahites
of
Shaul
the
family
of
the
Shaulites
14
These
were
the
families
of
the
Simeonites
22200
15
The
sons
of
Gad
by
their
families
were
of
Zephon
the
family
of
the
Zephonites
of
Haggi
the
family
of
the
Haggites
of
Shuni
the
family
of
the
Shunites
16
of
Ozni
the
family
of
the
Oznites
of
Eri
the
family
of
the
Erites
17
of
Arod
the
family
of
the

After
that

said
to
Moses
53
Among
these
the
land
should
be
divided
as
an
inheritance
according
to
the
list
of
the
names
54
For
the
larger
groups
you
should
increase
the
inheritance
and
for
the
smaller
groups
you
should
reduce
the
inheritance
Each
groups
inheritance
should
be
given
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
those
registered
55
However
the
land
should
be
apportioned
by
lot
They
should
receive
their
inheritance
according
to
the
names
of
the
tribes
of
their
fathers
56
Each
inheritance
will
be
determined
by
lot
and
apportioned
among
the
larger
and
the
smaller
groups
57
Now
these
were

became
father
to
Amram
59
And
the
name
of
Amrams
wife
was
Jochebed
Levis
daughter
whom
his
wife
bore
to
Levi
in
Egypt
And
to
Amram
she
bore
Aaron
and
Moses
and
their
sister
Miriam
60
Then
to
Aaron
there
were
born
Nadab
Abihu
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
61
But
Nadab
and
Abihu
died
for
presenting
unauthorized
fire
before
Jehovah
62
The
total
of
those
registered
was
23000
all
males
from
a
month
old
and
up
For
they
were
not
registered
among
the
Israelites
because
no
inheritance
was
to
be
given
to
them
among
the
Israelites
63
These
were
the
ones
registered
by
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
when
they
registered
the
Israelites
in
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
by
the
Jordan
at
Jericho
64
But
among
them
there
was
no
one
who
had
been
registered
by
Moses
and
Aaron
the
priest
in
the
census
of
the
Israelites
taken
in
the
wilderness
of
Sinai
65
For
Jehovah
had
said
concerning
them
They
will
die
without
fail
in
the
wilderness
So
there
was
not
a
man
left
of
them
except
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
1
Then
the
daughters
of
Zelophehad
the
son
of
Hepher
the
son
of
Gilead
the
son
of
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh
of
the
families
of
Manasseh
the
son
of
Joseph
approached
The
names
of
his
daughters
were
Mahlah
Noah
Hoglah
Milcah
and
Tirzah
2
They
stood
before
Moses
Eleazar
the
priest
the
chieftains
and
all
the
assembly
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
and
said
3
Our
father
died
in
the
wilderness
but
he
was
not
among
the
group
who
banded
together
against
Jehovah
the
supporters
of
Korah
but
he
died
for
his
own
sin
and
he
did
not
have
any
sons
4
Why
should
the
name
of
our
father
be
lost
from
his
family
because
he
had
no
son
Give
us
a
possession
among
our
fathers
brothers
5
So
Moses
presented
their
case
before
Jehovah
6
Jehovah
then
said
this
to
Moses
7
The
daughters
of
Zelophehad
are
correct
You
should
by
all
means
give
them
the
possession
as
an
inheritance
among
their
fathers
brothers
and
transfer
their
fathers
inheritance
to
them
8
And
tell
the
Israelites
If
a
man
dies
without
having
a
son
you
must
then
cause
his
inheritance
to
pass
to
his
daughter
9
And
if
he
has
no
daughter
you
will
give
his
inheritance
to
his
brothers
10
And
if
he
has
no
brothers
you
will
give
his
inheritance
to
his
fathers
brothers
11
And
if
his
father
has
no
brothers
you
will
give
his
inheritance
to
the
closest
blood
relative
in
his
family
and
he
will
take
possession
of
it
This
will
serve
as
a
statute
by
judicial
decision
for
the
Israelites
just
as
Jehovah
has
commanded
Moses
12
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Go
up
into
this
mountain
of
Abarim
and
view
the
land
that
I
will
give
the
Israelites
13
When
you
have
seen
it
you
will
also
be
gathered
to
your
people
just
as
Aaron
your
brother
was
14
because
when
the
assembly
was
quarreling
with
me
in
the
wilderness
of
Zin
you
rebelled
against
my
order
to
sanctify
me
before
them
by
means
of
the
waters
These
are
the
waters
of
Meribah
at
Kadesh
in
the
wilderness
of
Zin
15
Then
Moses
said
to
Jehovah
16
Let
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
spirit
of
all
people
appoint
over
the
assembly
a
man
17
who
will
go
out
and
come
in
before
them
and
who
will
lead
them
out
and
bring
them
in
so
that
Jehovahs
assembly
may
not
become
like
sheep
that
have
no
shepherd
18
So
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
Take
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
a
man
in
whom
there
is
spirit
and
lay
your
hand
on
him
19
Then
stand
him
before
Eleazar
the
priest
and
before
all
the
assembly
and
you
must
commission
him
before
their
eyes
20
You
are
to
confer
some
of
your
authority
on
him
so
that
all
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
may
listen
to
him
21
He
will
stand
before
Eleazar
the
priest
who
will
inquire
in
his
behalf
by
the
judgment
of
the
Urim
before
Jehovah
At
his
order
they
will
go
out
and
at
his
order
they
will
come
in
he
and
all
the
Israelites
with
him
and
all
the
assembly
22
So
Moses
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
He
took
Joshua
and
stood
him
before
Eleazar
the
priest
and
before
all
the
assembly
23
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
him
and
commissioned
him
just
as
Jehovah
had
spoken
through
Moses
1
Jehovah
next
said
to
Moses
2
Command
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
You
should
take
care
that
you
present
to
me
my
offering
my
bread
My
offerings
by
fire
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
me
must
be
made
at
their
appointed
times
3
And
say
to
them
This
is
the
offering
made
by
fire
that
you
will
present
to
Jehovah
two
sound
year-old
male
lambs
a
day
as
a
burnt
offering
regularly
4
The
one
male
lamb
you
will
offer
in
the
morning
and
the
other
male
lamb
you
will
offer
at
twilight
5
together
with
a
tenth
of
an
ephah
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
a
fourth
of
a
hin
of
beaten
oil
as
a
grain
offering
6
It
is
a
regular
burnt
offering
which
was
established
at
Mount
Sinai
as
a
pleasing
aroma
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
7
along
with
its
drink
offering
a
fourth
of
a
hin
for
each
male
lamb
Pour
out
the
alcoholic
drink
in
the
holy
place
as
a
drink
offering
to
Jehovah
8
And
you
will
offer
the
other
male
lamb
at
twilight
With
the
same
grain
offering
as
that
made
in
the
morning
and
with
its
same
drink
offering
you
will
present
it
as
an
offering
made
by
fire
as
a
pleasing
aroma
to
Jehovah
9
However
on
the
Sabbath
day
the
offering
should
be
two
sound
year-old
male
lambs
and
two
tenths
of
an
ephah
measure
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
oil
as
a
grain
offering
together
with
its
drink
offering
10
This
is
the
burnt
offering
for
the
Sabbath
along
with
the
regular
burnt
offering
and
its
drink
offering
11
At
the
start
of
each
month
you
will
present
as
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
two
young
bulls
one
ram
and
seven
sound
male
lambs
each
a

old
12
and
three
tenth
measures
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
oil
as
a
grain
offering
for
each
bull
and
two
tenth
measures
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
oil
as
a

offering
for
the

13
and
a
tenth
measure
of
fine
flour
mixed
with
oil
as
a
grain
offering
for
each
male
lamb
as
a
burnt
offering
a
pleasing
aroma
an
offering
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
14
And
their
drink
offerings
should
be
half
a
hin
of
wine
for
a
bull
and
a
third
of
a
hin
for
the
ram
and
a
fourth
of
a
hin
for
a
male
lamb
This
is
the
monthly
burnt
offering
each
month
throughout
the
year
15
Also
one
young
goat
should
be
offered
as
a

Moses
told
the
Israelites
everything
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
1
Then
Moses
spoke
to
the
heads
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
saying
This
is
the
word
that
Jehovah
has
commanded
2
If
a
man
makes
a
vow
to
Jehovah
or
swears
an
oath
to
impose
on
himself
a
vow
of
abstinence
he
must
not
violate
his
word
He
should
do
everything
he
vowed
he
would
do
3
And
if
a
woman
makes
a
vow
to
Jehovah
or
she
imposes
a
vow
of
abstinence
on
herself
when
she
is
young
and
living
in
the
house
of
her
father
4
and
her
father
hears
her
vow
or
her
abstinence
vow
that
she
has
imposed
on
herself
and
her
father
offers
no
objection
all
her
vows
will
stand
and
every
abstinence
vow
that
she
has
imposed
on
herself
will
stand
5
But
if
her
father
forbids
her
when
he
hears
that
she
has
imposed
vows
or
abstinence
vows
on
herself
it
will
not
stand
Jehovah
will
forgive
her
because
her
father
forbade
her
6
However
if
she
should
marry
a
husband
while
under
her
vow
or
the
rash
promise
that
she
has
imposed
on
herself
7
and
her
husband
hears
of
it
and
offers
no
objection
on
the
day
he
hears
of
it
her
vows
or
her
abstinence
vows
that
she
has
imposed
on
herself
will
stand
8
But
if
her
husband
forbids
her
on
the
day
he
hears
of
it
he
may
annul
the
vow
or
the
rash
promise
that
she
imposed
on
herself
and
Jehovah
will
forgive
her
9
But
if
a
widow
or
a
divorced
woman
makes
a
vow
everything
that
she
has
imposed
on
herself
will
be
binding
on
her
10
However
if
a
woman
imposed
the
vow
or
the
abstinence
vow
on
herself
while
in
the
house
of
her
husband
11
and
her
husband
heard
it
and
has
not
objected
or
disapproved
all
her
vows
or
any
abstinence
vow
that
she
imposed
on
herself
will
stand
12
But
if
on
the
day
he
heard
them
her
husband
completely
annulled
whatever
vows
or
abstinence
vow
she
swore
to
they
will
not
stand
Her
husband
annulled
them
and
Jehovah
will
forgive
her
13
Regarding
any
vow
or
any
oath
involving
an
abstinence
vow
to
practice
self-denial
her
husband
should
establish
it
or
her
husband
should
annul
it
14
But
if
her
husband
offers
no
objection
at
all
from
day
to
day
he
also
establishes
all
her
vows
or
all
her
abstinence
vows
that
are
upon
her
He
establishes
them
because
he
did
not
object
on
the
day
he
heard
her
make
them
15
But
if
he
annuls
them
later
sometime
after
the
day
he
heard
them
he
will
bear
the
consequences
of
her
guilt
16
These
are
the
regulations
that
Jehovah
commanded
Moses
relating
to
a
husband
and
his
wife
and
relating
to
a
father
and
his
young
daughter
living
in
his
house
1
Jehovah
then
told
Moses
2
Take
vengeance
for
the
Israelites
on
the
Midianites
Afterward
you
will
be
gathered
to
your
people
3
So
Moses
spoke
to
the
people
saying
Equip
men
from
among
you
for
battle
against
Midian
and
to
execute
Jehovahs
vengeance
on
Midian
4
You
should
send
1000
of
each
tribe
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
into
the
army
5
So
from
the
thousands
of
Israel
1000
were
assigned
from
each
tribe
12000
equipped
for
battle
6
Then
Moses
sent
them
out
1000
from
each
tribe
to
the
army
along
with
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
priest
for
the
army
who
had
the
holy
utensils
and
the
signal
trumpets
in
his
hand
7
They
waged
war
against
Midian
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
and
they
killed
every
male
8
Along
with
the
others
slain
they
killed
the
kings
of
Midian
namely
Evi
Rekem
Zur
Hur
and
Reba
the
five
kings
of
Midian
They
also
killed
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
with
the
sword
9
But
the
Israelites
carried
off
captive
the
women
and
children
of
Midian
They
also
plundered
all
their
domestic
animals
all
their
livestock
and
all
their
possessions
10
And
all
their
cities
in
which
they
had
settled
and
all
their
encampments
they
burned
with
fire
11
And
they
took
all
the
spoil
and
all
the
plunder
both
humans
and
animals
12
Then
they
brought
the
captives
the
plunder
and
the
spoil
to
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
and
to
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
to
the
camp
in
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
near
the
Jordan
at
Jericho
13
Then
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
and
all
the
chieftains
of
the
assembly
went
out
to
meet
them
outside
the
camp
14
But
Moses
grew
indignant
at
the
appointed
men
of
the
combat
forces
the
chiefs
of
the
thousands
and
the
chiefs
of
the
hundreds
who
were
coming
in
from
the
military
expedition
15
Moses
said
to
them
Have
you
preserved
all
the
females
alive
16
Look
They
are
the
ones
who
by
Balaams
word
induced
the
Israelites
to
commit
unfaithfulness
toward
Jehovah
over
the
affair
of
Peor
so
that
the
scourge
came
upon
the
assembly
of
Jehovah
17
Now
you
should
kill
every
male
among
the
children
and
kill
every
woman
who
has
had
sexual
relations
with
a
man
18
But
you
may
keep
alive
all
the
young
girls
who
have
not
had
sexual
relations
with
a
man
19
And
you
should
camp
outside
the
camp
seven
days
Every
one
of
you
who
has
killed
someone
and
every
one
of
you
who
has
touched
someone
slain
should
purify
himself
on
the
third
day
and
on
the
seventh
day
you
and
your
captives
20
And
you
should
purify
from
sin
every
garment
every
article
of
skin
everything
made
of
goat
hair
and
every
article
of
wood
21
Eleazar
the
priest
then
said
to
the
men
of
the
army
who
had
gone
into
the
battle
This
is
the
statute
of
the
law
that
Jehovah
commanded
Moses
22
Only
the
gold
the
silver
the
copper
the
iron
the
tin
and
the
lead
23
everything
that
can
be
processed
with
fire
you
should
pass
through
the
fire
and
it
will
be
clean
However
it
should
also
be
purified
by
the
water
for
cleansing
Everything
that
cannot
be
processed
with
fire
you
should
pass
through
the
water
24
And
you
should
wash
your
garments
on
the
seventh
day
and
be
clean
and
then
you
may
come
into
the
camp
25
Jehovah
then
said
this
to
Moses
26
Take
an
inventory
of
the
plunder
counting
the
captives
both
of
humans
and
animals
do
this
together
with
Eleazar
the
priest
and
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
assembly
27
Divide
what
was
plundered
into
two
parts
to
be
shared
between
those
in
the
army
who
took
part
in
the
battle
and
all
the
rest
of
the
assembly
28
As
a
tax
for
Jehovah
you
should
take
from
the
soldiers
who
went
out
into
the
battle
one
soul
out
of
every
500
of
the
people
the
herd
the
donkeys
and
the
flock
29
You
should
take
it
from
their
half
and
give
it
to
Eleazar
the
priest
as
Jehovahs
contribution
30
From
the
half
given
to
the
Israelites
you
should
take
one
out
of
50
of
the
people
the
herd
the
donkeys
the
flock
and
every
sort
of
domestic
animal
and
give
them
to
the
Levites
who
care
for
the
responsibilities
connected
with
Jehovahs
tabernacle
31
So
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
32
The
spoils
the
rest
of
the
plunder
that
the
people
of
the
expedition
had
taken
amounted
to
675000
of
the
flock
33
72000
of
the
herd
34
and
61000
donkeys
35
The
women
who
had
not
had
sexual
relations
with
a
man
amounted
to
32000
women
36
The
half
that
was
the
share
of
those
who
went
out
into
the
battle
amounted
to
337500
of
the
flock
37
The
tax
for
Jehovah
from
the
flock
amounted
to
675
38
And
there
were
36000
of
the
herd
and
the
tax
on
them
for
Jehovah
was
72
39
And
there
were
30500
donkeys
and
the
tax
on
them
for
Jehovah
was
61
40
And
there
were
16000
humans
and
the
tax
on
them
for
Jehovah
was
32
persons
41
Then
Moses
gave
the
tax
as
Jehovahs
contribution
to
Eleazar
the
priest
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
42
From
the
half
belonging
to
the
Israelites
which
Moses
had
divided
off
from
the
portion
that
belonged
to
the
men
who
waged
war
43
that
half
of
the
flock
amounted
to
337500
44
and
of
the
herd
36000
45
and
of
the
donkeys
30500
46
and
of
the
people
16000
47
Then
Moses
took
from
the
half
belonging
to
the
Israelites
one
out
of
50
of
the
people
and
of
the
animals
and
gave
them
to
the
Levites
who
cared
for
the
responsibility
of
Jehovahs
tabernacle
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
48
Then
the
appointed
men
who
were
of
the
thousands
of
the
army
the
chiefs
of
the
thousands
and
the
chiefs
of
the
hundreds
approached
Moses
49
and
they
said
to
Moses
Your
servants
have
taken
the
count
of
the
men
of
war
who
are
under
our
command
and
not
one
has
been
reported
missing
from
us
50
So
let
us
each
present
what
he
has
found
as
Jehovahs
offering
articles
of
gold
ankle
chains
bracelets
signet
rings
earrings
and
other
jewelry
in
order
to
make
atonement
for
ourselves
before
Jehovah
51
So
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
accepted
the
gold
from
them
all
the
jewelry
52
All
the
gold
of
the
contribution
that
they
made
to
Jehovah
amounted
to
16750
shekels
from
the
chiefs
of
the
thousands
and
the
chiefs
of
the
hundreds
53
The
men
of
the
army
had
each
taken
plunder
for
himself
54
Moses
and
Eleazar
the
priest
accepted
the
gold
from
the
chiefs
of
the
thousands
and
of
the
hundreds
and
brought
it
into
the
tent
of
meeting
as
a
reminder
for
the
people
of
Israel
before
Jehovah
1
Now
the
sons
of
Reuben
and
the
sons
of
Gad
had
very
large
quantities
of
livestock
and
they
saw
that
the
lands
of
Jazer
and
Gilead
were
a
good
region
for
livestock
2
So
the
sons
of
Gad
and
the
sons
of
Reuben
approached
Moses
Eleazar
the
priest
and
the
chieftains
of
the
assembly
and
said
3
Ataroth
Dibon
Jazer
Nimrah
Heshbon
Elealeh

and

4
the
land
that
Jehovah
defeated
before
the
assembly
of
Israel
is
a
good
land
for
livestock
and
your
servants
have
much
livestock
5
They
continued
If
we
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
let
this
be
the
land
given
to
your
servants
as
a
possession
Do
not
make
us
cross
the
Jordan
6
Then
Moses
said
to
the
sons
of
Gad
and
the
sons
of
Reuben
Are
your
brothers
to
go
to
war
while
you
yourselves
keep
dwelling
here
7
Why
should
you
discourage
the
people
of
Israel
from
crossing
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
is
certain
to
give
them
8
That
is
what
your
fathers
did
when
I
sent
them
from
Kadesh-barnea
to
see
the
land
9
When
they
went
up
to
the
Valley
of
Eshcol
and
saw
the
land
they
discouraged
the
people
of
Israel
from
going
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
was
to
give
them
10
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
on
that
day
so
that
he
swore
11
The
men
who
came
up
out
of
Egypt
from
20
years
old
and
up
will
not
see
the
land
of
which
I
have
sworn
to
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
because
they
have
not
followed
me
wholeheartedly—
12
except
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
the
Kenizzite
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
because
they
have
followed
Jehovah
wholeheartedly
13
So
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
Israel
and
he
made
them
wander
about
in
the
wilderness
for
40
years
until
all
the
generation
that
was
doing
evil
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
came
to
its
end
14
Now
here
you
have
risen
in
the
place
of
your
fathers
as
a
brood
of
sinful
men
who
increase
the
burning
anger
of
Jehovah
against
Israel
15
If
you
turn
back
from
following
him
he
will
certainly
leave
them
again
in
the
wilderness
and
you
will
bring
ruin
to
all
this
people
16
They
later
approached
him
and
said
Let
us
build
here
stone
pens
for
our
livestock
and
cities
for
our
children
17
But
we
will
continue
ready
for
battle
and
will
go
before
the
Israelites
until
we
have
brought
them
to
their
place
while
our
children
will
dwell
in
the
fortified
cities
safe
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
18
We
will
not
return
to
our
houses
until
each
of
the
Israelites
has
received
his
land
as
an
inheritance
19
For
we
will
not
receive
an
inheritance
with
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
and
beyond
because
we
have
received
our
inheritance
on
the
east
side
of
the
Jordan
20
Moses
replied
to
them
If
you
will
do
this
Take
up
arms
before
Jehovah
for
the
war
21
and
if
every
one
of
you
takes
up
arms
and
crosses
the
Jordan
before
Jehovah
as
he
drives
away
his
enemies
from
before
him
22
until
the
land
is
subdued
before
Jehovah
afterward
you
may
return
and
be
free
from
guilt
before
Jehovah
and
Israel
Then
this
land
will
become
your
possession
before
Jehovah
23
But
if
you
do
not
do
this
you
will
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
In
that
case
know
that
your
sin
will
catch
up
with
you
24
So
you
may
build
cities
for
your
children
and
pens
for
your
flocks
but
you
must
do
what
you
have
promised
25
The
sons
of
Gad
and
the
sons
of
Reuben
said
this
to
Moses
Your
servants
will
do
just
as
my
lord
is
commanding
26
Our
children
our
wives
our
livestock
and
all
our
domestic
animals
will
stay
there
in
the
cities
of
Gilead
27
but
your
servants
will
cross
over
every
man
armed
for
battle
to
wage
war
before
Jehovah
just
as
my
lord
is
speaking
28
So
Moses
gave
a
command
concerning
them
to
Eleazar
the
priest
to
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
and
to
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
29
Moses
said
to
them
If
the
sons
of
Gad
and
the
sons
of
Reuben
cross
over
the
Jordan
with
you
every
man
armed
for
the
war
before
Jehovah
and
the
land
is
subdued
before
you
you
will
then
give
them
the
land
of
Gilead
as
a
possession
30
But
if
they
do
not
take
up
arms
and
cross
over
with
you
they
will
then
settle
among
you
in
the
land
of
Canaan
31
To
this
the
sons
of
Gad
and
the
sons
of
Reuben
answered
What
Jehovah
has
spoken
to
your
servants
is
what
we
will
do
32
We
will
take
up
arms
and
cross
over
before
Jehovah
to
the
land
of
Canaan
but
the
possession
we
are
to
inherit
will
be
on
this
side
of
the
Jordan
33
So
Moses
gave
to
them—to
the
sons
of
Gad
the
sons
of
Reuben
and
to
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
the
son
of
Joseph—the
kingdom
of
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites
and
the
kingdom
of
Og
the
king
of
Bashan
the
land
belonging
to
its
cities
in
those
territories
and
the
cities
of
the
surrounding
land
34
And
the
sons
of
Gad
built
Dibon
Ataroth
Aroer
35
Atroth-shophan
Jazer
Jogbehah
36
Beth-nimrah
and
Beth-haran
fortified
cities
and
they
built
stone
pens
for
the
flocks
37
And
the
sons
of
Reuben
built
Heshbon
Elealeh
Kiriathaim
38
Nebo
and
Baal-meon—their
names
being
changed—and
Sibmah
and
they
began
to
rename
the
cities
that
they
rebuilt
39
The
sons
of
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh
marched
against
Gilead
and
captured
it
and
drove
away
the
Amorites
who
were
in
it
40
So
Moses
gave
Gilead
to
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh
and
he
began
dwelling
in
it
41
And
Jair
the
son
of
Manasseh
marched
against
them
and
captured
their
tent
villages
and
he
began
to
call
them
Havvoth-jair
42
And
Nobah
marched
against
and
captured
Kenath
and
its
dependent
towns
and
he
began
to
call
it
Nobah
by
his
own
name
1
These
were
the
stages
of
the
journey
of
the
people
of
Israel
when
they
went
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
by
their
companies
under
the
direction
of
Moses
and
Aaron
2
Moses
kept
recording
the
departure
places
by
the
stages
of
their
journey
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
and
these
were
their
stages
from
one
departure
place
to
another
3
They
departed
from
Rameses
in
the
first
month
on
the
15th
day
of
the
month
On
the
very
day
after
the
Passover
the
Israelites
went
out
with
confidence
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
Egyptians
4
Meanwhile
the
Egyptians
were
burying
all
the
firstborn
whom
Jehovah
had
struck
down
among
them
for
Jehovah
had
executed
judgments
on
their
gods
5
So
the
Israelites
departed
from
Rameses
and
camped
at
Succoth
6
Then
they

After

9
Then
they

and
came

Elim
Now
in

10
Next

where
there
was
no

the
people
to

15
After
that
they
departed
from

and
camped
in
the
wilderness
of

16
They

and

21
They

and
camped
at

22
Next
they

23
Then

Then

After
that
they
departed
from
Ezion-geber
and
camped
in
the
wilderness
of
Zin
that
is
Kadesh
37
Later
they
departed
from
Kadesh
and
camped
at
Mount
Hor
on
the
frontier
of
the
land
of
Edom
38
And
Aaron
the
priest
went
up
into
Mount
Hor
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
and
died
there
in
the
40th
year
after
the
Israelites
left
the
land
of
Egypt
in
the
fifth
month
on
the
first
of
the
month
39
Aaron
was
123
years
old
at
his
death
on
Mount
Hor
40
Now
the
king
of
Arad
the
Canaanite
who
was
dwelling
in
the
Negeb
in
the
land
of
Canaan
heard
about
the
coming
of
the
Israelites
41
In
time
they

Hor
and
camped
at

on

45
Later
they

and
camped
at

46
After
that
they
departed
from

and
camped
at

47
Then
they
departed
from
Almon-diblathaim
and
camped
in
the
mountains
of
Abarim
before

48
Finally
they
departed
from
the
mountains
of
Abarim
and
camped
on
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
by
the
Jordan
at
Jericho
49
They
continued
camping
along
the
Jordan
from
Beth-jeshimoth
as
far
as
Abel-shittim
on
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
50
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
on
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
by
the
Jordan
at
Jericho
saying
51
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
You
are
crossing
the
Jordan
into
the
land
of
Canaan
52
You
must
drive
away
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
from
before
you
and
destroy
all
their
carvings
of
stone
and
all
their
metal
statues
and
you
should
demolish
all
their
sacred
high
places
53
And
you
will
take
possession
of
the
land
and
dwell
in
it
because
I
will
certainly
give
you
the
land
as
a
possession
54
You
must
apportion
the
land
by
lot
as
a
possession
among
your
families
To
the
larger
group
you
should
increase
his
inheritance
and
to
the
smaller
group
you
should
reduce
his
inheritance
Everyones
inheritance
will
be
where
his
lot
falls
You
will
receive
your
property
as
an
inheritance
by
the
tribes
of
your
fathers
55
If
though
you
do
not
drive
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
away
from
before
you
those
whom
you
allow
to
remain
will
be
as
irritants
in
your
eyes
and
thorns
in
your
sides
and
they
will
harass
you
in
the
land
where
you
will
dwell
56
And
I
will
do
to
you
what
I
intended
to
do
to
them
1
And
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
2
Give
these
instructions
to
the
Israelites
When
you
go
into
the
land
of
Canaan
this
is
the
land
that
will
fall
to
you
as
an
inheritance
the
land
of
Canaan
according
to
its
boundaries
3
Your
southern
border
will
extend
from
the
wilderness
of
Zin
alongside
Edom
and
your
south
boundary
on
the
east
will
be
from
the
extremity
of
the
Salt
Sea
4
Your
boundary
will
change
direction
to
pass
south
of
the
ascent
of
Akrabbim
and
continue
to
Zin
and
its
end
will
be
south
of
Kadesh-barnea
Then
it
will
extend
to
Hazar-addar
and
continue
to
Azmon
5
The
boundary
will
change
direction
at
Azmon
to
the
Wadi
of
Egypt
and
its
end
will
be
at
the
Sea
6
Your
western
boundary
will
be
the
Great
Sea
and
the
coast
This
will
become
your
western
boundary
7
Now
this
will
be
your
northern
boundary
From
the
Great
Sea
you
will
mark
your
boundary
out
to
Mount
Hor
8
From
Mount
Hor
you
will
mark
out
the
boundary
to
Lebo-hamath
and
the
end
of
the
boundary
will
be
at
Zedad
9
And
the
boundary
will
extend
to
Ziphron
and
its
end
will
be
Hazar-enan
This
will
become
your
northern
boundary
10
Then
you
should
mark
as
your
boundary
on
the
east
from
Hazar-enan
to
Shepham
11
The
boundary
will
extend
from
Shepham
to
Riblah
to
the
east
of
Ain
and
the
border
will
go
down
and
cross
the
eastern
slope
of
the
Sea
of
Chinnereth
12
The
border
will
extend
to
the
Jordan
and
its
end
will
be
the
Salt
Sea
This
will
be
your
land
and
the
boundaries
surrounding
it
13
So
Moses
instructed
the
Israelites
saying
This
is
the
land
that
you
will
apportion
as
your
possession
by
lot
just
as
Jehovah
has
commanded
to
give
to
the
nine
and
a
half
tribes
14
For
the
tribe
of
the
Reubenites
by
their
paternal
house
the
tribe
of
the
Gadites
by
their
paternal
house
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
have
already
taken
their
inheritance
15
The
two
and
a
half
tribes
have
already
taken
their
inheritance
east
of
the
region
of
the
Jordan
by
Jericho
toward
the
sunrising
16
Jehovah
spoke
further
to
Moses
saying
17
These
are
the
names
of
the
men
who
will
divide
the
land
for
you
to
possess
Eleazar
the
priest
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
18
And
you
will
take
one
chieftain
out
of
each
tribe
to
divide
the
land
as
your
inheritance
19
These
are
the
names
of
the
men
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
20
of
the
tribe
of
the

of

28
of
the

29
These
are
the
ones
whom
Jehovah
commanded
to
distribute
the
land
to
the
Israelites
in
the
land
of
Canaan
1
Jehovah
went
on
to
speak
to
Moses
on
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
by
the
Jordan
at
Jericho
saying
2
Instruct
the
Israelites
that
they
are
to
give
the
Levites
cities
to
inhabit
out
of
the
inheritance
they
will
possess
and
they
should
give
the
Levites
the
pastures
around
the
cities
3
They
will
inhabit
the
cities
and
the
pastures
will
be
for
their
livestock
their
goods
and
all
their
other
animals
4
The
pastures
of
the
cities
that
you
will
give
the
Levites
will
extend
for
1000
cubits
from
the
wall
all
around
the
city
5
You
should
measure
outside
the
city
2000
cubits
on
the
east
side
2000
cubits
on
the
south
side
2000
cubits
on
the
west
side
and
2000
cubits
on
the
north
side
with
the
city
in
the
middle
These
will
be
the
pastures
of
their
cities
6
The
cities
that
you
will
give
to
the
Levites
will
be
6
cities
of
refuge
which
you
will
give
for
the
manslayer
to
flee
to
as
well
as
42
other
cities
7
You
are
to
give
to
the
Levites
a
total
of
48
cities
together
with
their
pastures
8
The
cities
you
give
them
will
be
from
the
possession
of
the
Israelites
From
the
larger
group
you
will
take
many
and
from
the
smaller
group
you
will
take
few
Each
group
will
give
some
of
its
cities
to
the
Levites
in
proportion
to
the
inheritance
that
it
receives
9
Jehovah
continued
to
speak
to
Moses
saying
10
Speak
to
the
Israelites
and
tell
them
You
are
crossing
the
Jordan
to
the
land
of
Canaan
11
You
should
choose
cities
convenient
for
yourselves
to
serve
as
cities
of
refuge
where
the
manslayer
who
unintentionally
kills
someone
should
flee
12
These
cities
will
serve
as
a
refuge
for
you
from
the
blood
avenger
so
that
the
manslayer
will
not
die
until
he
stands
trial
before
the
assembly
13
The
six
cities
of
refuge
that
you
provide
will
serve
this
purpose
14
You
will
provide
three
cities
on
this
side
of
the
Jordan
and
three
cities
in
the
land
of
Canaan
to
serve
as
cities
of
refuge
15
These
six
cities
will
serve
as
a
refuge
for
the
Israelites
for
the
foreign
resident
and
for
the
settler
among
them
for
anyone
to
flee
there
who
unintentionally
kills
someone
16
But
if
he
struck
him
with
an
iron
instrument
and
he
dies
he
is
a
murderer
The
murderer
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
17
And
if
he
struck
him
with
a
stone
that
could
cause
death
and
he
dies
he
is
a
murderer
The
murderer
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
18
And
if
he
struck
him
with
a
wooden
instrument
that
could
cause
death
and
he
dies
he
is
a
murderer
The
murderer
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
19
The
avenger
of
blood
is
the
one
who
will
put
the
murderer
to
death
When
he
encounters
him
he
himself
will
put
him
to
death
20
If
death
resulted
because
he
pushed
him
out
of
hatred
or
threw
something
at
him
with
malicious
intent
21
or
out
of
hatred
he
struck
him
with
his
hand
and
he
died
the
one
who
struck
him
will
be
put
to
death
without
fail
He
is
a
murderer
The
avenger
of
blood
will
put
the
murderer
to
death
when
he
encounters
him
22
But
if
it
was
unexpectedly
and
not
out
of
hatred
that
he
pushed
him
or
threw
any
article
at
him
without
malicious
intent
23
or
if
he
did
not
see
him
and
caused
a
stone
to
fall
on
him
and
he
was
not
an
enemy
or
seeking
his
injury
and
the
person
died
24
the
assembly
should
then
judge
between
the
one
who
struck
him
and
the
avenger
of
blood
in
harmony
with
these
judgments
25
The
assembly
should
then
save
the
manslayer
from
the
hand
of
the
avenger
of
blood
and
return
him
to
his
city
of
refuge
to
which
he
had
fled
and
he
must
dwell
in
it
until
the
death
of
the
high
priest
who
was
anointed
with
the
holy
oil
26
But
if
the
manslayer
goes
out
of
the
boundary
of
his
city
of
refuge
to
which
he
fled
27
and
the
avenger
of
blood
finds
him
outside
the
boundary
of
his
city
of
refuge
and
slays
the
manslayer
he
has
no
bloodguilt
28
For
he
must
dwell
in
his
city
of
refuge
until
the
high
priests
death
But
after
the
high
priests
death
the
manslayer
may
return
to
the
land
that
he
owns
29
These
things
will
serve
for
you
as
a
statute
for
judgment
throughout
your
generations
in
all
your
dwelling
places
30
Whoever
kills
a
person
should
be
put
to
death
as
a
murderer
on
the
testimony
of
witnesses
but
no
one
will
be
put
to
death
on
the
testimony
of
just
one
witness
31
You
must
take
no
ransom
for
the
life
of
a
murderer
who
is
deserving
to
die
for
he
should
be
put
to
death
without
fail
32
And
you
must
not
take
a
ransom
for
one
who
has
fled
to
his
city
of
refuge
allowing
him
to
resume
dwelling
in
his
land
before
the
death
of
the
high
priest
33
You
must
not
pollute
the
land
in
which
you
live
for
blood
pollutes
the
land
and
there
may
be
no
atonement
for
the
blood
that
has
been
spilled
on
the
land
except
by
the
blood
of
the
one
who
spilled
it
34
You
must
not
defile
the
land
in
which
you
dwell
in
which
I
am
residing
for
I
Jehovah
am
residing
in
the
midst
of
the
people
of
Israel
1
The
family
heads
of
the
descendants
of
Gilead
the
son
of
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh
of
the
families
of
the
sons
of
Joseph
approached
and
spoke
before
Moses
and
the
chieftains
the
family
heads
of
the
Israelites
2
They
said
Jehovah
commanded
my
lord
to
distribute
the
land
by
lot
as
an
inheritance
to
the
Israelites
and
my
lord
was
commanded
by
Jehovah
to
give
the
inheritance
of
our
brother
Zelophehad
to
his
daughters
3
If
they
marry
men
from
another
Israelite
tribe
the
womens
inheritance
will
also
be
withdrawn
from
the
inheritance
of
our
fathers
and
be
added
to
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
to
which
they
would
then
belong
so
that
it
would
be
withdrawn
from
the
lot
of
our
inheritance
4
Now
when
the
Jubilee
takes
place
for
the
people
of
Israel
the
womens
inheritance
will
also
be
added
to
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
to
which
they
then
belong
so
that
their
inheritance
would
be
withdrawn
from
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
our
fathers
5
Then
Moses
commanded
the
Israelites
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
What
the
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Joseph
is
saying
is
correct
6
This
is
the
word
that
Jehovah
has
commanded
for
the
daughters
of
Zelophehad
They
may
marry
whomever
they
wish
However
they
should
marry
someone
from
a
family
of
the
tribe
of
their
father
7
No
inheritance
of
the
Israelites
should
circulate
from
tribe
to
tribe
for
the
Israelites
should
hold
on
to
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
their
forefathers
8
And
every
daughter
who
possesses
an
inheritance
among
the
tribes
of
Israel
should
become
a
wife
of
a
descendant
of
her
fathers
tribe
so
that
the
Israelites
may
keep
possession
of
the
inheritance
of
their
forefathers
9
No
inheritance
should
circulate
from
one
tribe
to
another
tribe
for
the
tribes
of
Israel
should
hold
on
to
their
own
inheritance
10
The
daughters
of
Zelophehad
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
11
So
Mahlah
Tirzah
Hoglah
Milcah
and
Noah
the
daughters
of
Zelophehad
married
the
sons
of
their
fathers
brothers
12
They
became
wives
of
men
from
the
families
of
Manasseh
the
son
of
Joseph
so
that
their
inheritance
would
remain
in
the
tribe
of
their
fathers
family
13
These
are
the
commandments
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
Jehovah
gave
to
the
Israelites
through
Moses
on
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
by
the
Jordan
at
Jericho
1
These
are
the
words
that
Moses
spoke
to
all
Israel
in
the
region
of
the
Jordan
in
the
wilderness
on
the
desert
plains
in
front
of
Suph
between
Paran
Tophel
Laban
Hazeroth
and
Dizahab
2
It
is
11
days
from
Horeb
to
Kadesh-barnea
by
way
of
Mount
Seir
3
In
the
40th
year
in
the
11th
month
on
the
first
of
the
month
Moses
spoke
to
the
Israelites
according
to
all
that
Jehovah
had
instructed
him
to
tell
them
4
This
was
after
he
defeated
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites
who
was
dwelling
in
Heshbon
and
Og
the
king
of
Bashan
who
was
dwelling
in
Ashtaroth
in
Edrei
5
In
the
region
of
the
Jordan
in
the
land
of
Moab
Moses
undertook
to
explain
this
Law
saying
6
Jehovah
our
God
told
us
in
Horeb
You
have
stayed
long
enough
in
this
mountainous
region
7
Turn
and
set
out
for
the
mountainous
region
of
the
Amorites
and
toward
all
their
neighbors
in
the
Arabah
the
mountainous
region
the
Shephelah
the
Negeb
and
the
seacoast
the
land
of
the
Canaanites
and
Lebanon
up
to
the
great
river
the
river
Euphrates
8
See
I
have
set
the
land
before
you
Go
in
and
take
possession
of
the
land
about
which
Jehovah
swore
to
your
fathers
to
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
to
give
it
to
them
and
their
offspring
after
them
9
And
I
told
you
at
that
time
I
am
not
able
to
carry
you
by
myself
10
Jehovah
your
God
has
multiplied
you
and
here
you
are
today
as
numerous
as
the
stars
of
the
heavens
11
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
multiply
you
a
thousand
times
as
many
as
you
are
and
may
he
bless
you
just
as
he
has
promised
you
12
How
can
I
bear
by
myself
the
burden
of
you
and
the
load
of
you
and
your
quarreling
13
Select
wise
discreet
and
experienced
men
of
your
tribes
and
I
will
appoint
them
as
heads
over
you
14
You
answered
me
What
you
have
told
us
to
do
is
good
15
So
I
took
the
heads
of
your
tribes
wise
and
experienced
men
and
appointed
them
as
heads
over
you
chiefs
of
thousands
chiefs
of
hundreds
chiefs
of
fifties
chiefs
of
tens
and
officers
of
your
tribes
16
At
that
time
I
instructed
your
judges
When
you
hear
a
case
between
your
brothers
you
are
to
judge
with
righteousness
between
a
man
and
his
brother
or
a
foreign
resident
17
You
must
not
be
partial
in
judgment
You
should
hear
the
small
one
the
same
as
the
great
one
You
must
not
become
intimidated
by
men
for
the
judgment
belongs
to
God
and
if
a
case
is
too
difficult
for
you
you
should
present
it
to
me
and
I
will
hear
it
18
At
that
time
I
instructed
you
regarding
all
the
things
that
you
should
do
19
Then
we
departed
from
Horeb
and
marched
through
all
that
great
and
fearsome
wilderness
that
you
saw
on
the
way
to
the
mountainous
region
of
the
Amorites
just
as
Jehovah
our
God
had
commanded
us
and
we
eventually
came
to
Kadesh-barnea
20
I
then
said
to
you
You
have
come
to
the
mountainous
region
of
the
Amorites
which
Jehovah
our
God
is
giving
to
us
21
See
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
the
land
over
to
you
Go
up
take
possession
of
it
just
as
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
has
told
you
Do
not
be
afraid
or
terrified
22
However
all
of
you
approached
me
and
said
Let
us
send
men
ahead
of
us
to
search
out
the
land
for
us
and
bring
word
back
to
us
as
to
what
route
we
should
take
and
what
kind
of
cities
we
will
encounter
23
The
suggestion
seemed
good
to
me
so
I
selected
12
of
your
men
one
for
each
tribe
24
They
left
and
went
up
into
the
mountainous
region
and
reached
the
Valley
of
Eshcol
and
spied
it
out
25
They
took
some
of
the
fruitage
of
the
land
and
carried
it
back
to
us
and
they
brought
word
back
to
us
The
land
that
Jehovah
our
God
is
giving
us
is
good
26
But
you
refused
to
go
up
and
you
rebelled
against
the
order
of
Jehovah
your
God
27
You
kept
grumbling
in
your
tents
and
were
saying
It
was
because
Jehovah
hated
us
that
he
brought
us
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
to
hand
us
over
to
the
Amorites
to
annihilate
us
28
What
kind
of
place
are
we
going
to
Our
brothers
made
us
lose
heart
by
saying
They
are
a
people
greater
and
taller
than
we
are
and
their
cities
are
great
and
fortified
to
the
heavens
and
we
saw
the
sons
of
the
Anakim
there
29
So
I
said
to
you
Do
not
be
struck
with
terror
or
be
afraid
because
of
them
30
Jehovah
your
God
will
go
before
you
and
will
fight
for
you
just
as
he
did
in
Egypt
before
your
very
eyes
31
And
you
saw
in
the
wilderness
how
Jehovah
your
God
carried
you
just
as
a
man
carries
his
son
everywhere
you
went
until
you
came
to
this
place
32
But
despite
all
of
this
you
did
not
put
faith
in
Jehovah
your
God
33
who
was
going
ahead
of
you
on
the
way
to
spy
out
a
place
for
you
to
camp
He
appeared
by
fire
at
night
and
by
a
cloud
in
the
daytime
to
show
you
the
way
you
should
walk
34
All
the
while
Jehovah
heard
what
you
were
saying
and
he
became
indignant
and
solemnly
swore
35
Not
one
of
these
men
of
this
evil
generation
will
see
the
good
land
that
I
swore
to
give
to
your
fathers
36
except
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
He
will
see
it
and
I
will
give
the
land
on
which
he
walked
to
him
and
to
his
sons
because
he
has
followed
Jehovah
wholeheartedly
37
Jehovah
even
became
angry
with
me
because
of
you
and
he
said
You
too
will
not
go
in
there
38
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
who
stands
before
you
is
the
one
who
will
enter
into
the
land
Make
him
strong
for
he
will
cause
Israel
to
inherit
it
39
Moreover
your
children
who
you
said
would
become
plunder
and
your
sons
who
today
do
not
know
good
or
bad
these
will
enter
and
I
will
give
it
to
them
to
possess
40
But
as
for
you
turn
back
and
depart
for
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
Red
Sea
41
At
this
you
said
to
me
We
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
We
will
now
go
up
and
fight
just
as
Jehovah
our
God
has
commanded
us
So
each
of
you
put
on
his
weapons
of
war
and
you
thought
it
would
be
an
easy
thing
to
go
up
the
mountain
42
But
Jehovah
said
to
me
Tell
them
You
must
not
go
up
and
fight
for
I
will
not
be
with
you
If
you
do
you
will
be
defeated
by
your
enemies
43
So
I
spoke
to
you
but
you
did
not
listen
Instead
you
rebelled
against
Jehovahs
order
and
presumptuously
tried
to
go
up
the
mountain
44
Then
the
Amorites
who
were
dwelling
in
that
mountain
came
out
to
meet
you
and
chased
you
away
like
bees
do
and
they
scattered
you
in
Seir
as
far
as
Hormah
45
So
you
returned
and
began
to
weep
before
Jehovah
but
Jehovah
did
not
listen
to
you
or
pay
attention
to
you
46
That
is
why
you
kept
dwelling
in
Kadesh
for
as
long
as
you
did
1
Then
we
turned
and
departed
for
the
wilderness
by
the
way
of
the
Red
Sea
just
as
Jehovah
had
told
me
and
we
traveled
for
many
days
around
Mount
Seir
2
Finally
Jehovah
said
to
me
3
You
have
gone
around
this
mountain
long
enough
Now
turn
north
4
And
give
this
command
to
the
people
You
will
pass
by
the
border
of
your
brothers
the
descendants
of
Esau
who
are
dwelling
in
Seir
and
they
will
be
afraid
of
you
and
you
must
be
very
careful
5
Do
not
engage
in
hostilities
with
them
for
I
will
not
give
you
any
of
their
land
not
even
the
space
of
a
footprint
because
I
have
given
Mount
Seir
to
Esau
as
his
possession
6
You
should
give
them
money
for
the
food
you
will
eat
and
you
should
pay
for
the
water
you
will
drink
7
For
Jehovah
your
God
has
blessed
you
in
all
that
you
have
done
He
is
fully
aware
of
your
walking
through
this
great
wilderness
These
40
years
Jehovah
your
God
has
been
with
you
and
you
have
lacked
nothing
8
So
we
passed
by
our
brothers
the
descendants
of
Esau
who
are
dwelling
in
Seir
keeping
away
from
the
way
of
the
Arabah
from
Elath
and
from
Ezion-geber
Next
we
turned
and
traveled
by
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
Moab
9
Jehovah
then
said
to
me
Do
not
engage
in
hostilities
or
in
war
with
Moab
for
I
will
not
give
you
any
of
his
land
as
a
possession
because
I
have
given
Ar
as
a
possession
to
the
descendants
of
Lot
10
The
Emim
formerly
lived
there
a
people
great
and
numerous
and
tall
like
the
Anakim
11
The
Rephaim
were
also
considered
like
the
Anakim
and
the
Moabites
used
to
call
them
Emim
12
Previously
the
Horites
were
living
in
Seir
but
the
descendants
of
Esau
dispossessed
and
annihilated
them
and
settled
in
their
place
just
as
Israel
will
do
to
the
land
that
is
their
possession
which
Jehovah
will
certainly
give
to
them
13
Now
go
and
cross
over
the
Valley
of
Zered
So
we
crossed
over
the
Valley
of
Zered
14
The
time
it
took
us
to
walk
from
Kadesh-barnea
until
we
crossed
the
Valley
of
Zered
was
38
years
until
the
entire
generation
of
the
men
of
war
had
perished
from
the
camp
just
as
Jehovah
had
sworn
to
them
15
Jehovahs
hand
was
against
them
to
eliminate
them
from
the
camp
until
they
had
perished
16
As
soon
as
all
the
men
of
war
had
died
off
from
among
the
people
17
Jehovah
spoke
to
me
again
saying
18
Today
you
are
to
pass
by
the
territory
of
Moab
that
is
Ar
19
When
you
come
near
to
the
Ammonites
do
not
harass
or
provoke
them
for
I
will
not
give
you
any
of
the
land
of
the
Ammonites
as
a
possession
because
I
have
given
it
to
the
descendants
of
Lot
as
their
possession
20
This
too
used
to
be
considered
the
land
of
the
Rephaim
The
Rephaim
formerly
lived
there
and
the
Ammonites
used
to
call
them
Zamzummim
21
They
were
a
great
and
numerous
and
tall
people
like
the
Anakim
but
Jehovah
annihilated
them
before
the
Ammonites
and
these
drove
them
out
and
settled
in
their
place
22
That
is
what
he
did
for
the
descendants
of
Esau
who
now
dwell
in
Seir
when
he
annihilated
the
Horites
from
before
them
so
that
they
could
dispossess
them
and
dwell
in
their
place
to
this
very
day
23
As
for
the
Avvim
they
had
dwelled
in
settlements
as
far
as
Gaza
until
the
Caphtorim
who
came
out
from
Caphtor
annihilated
them
and
settled
in
their
place
24
Get
up
and
make
your
way
across
the
Arnon
Valley
See
I
have
given
into
your
hand
Sihon
the
Amorite
king
of
Heshbon
So
begin
taking
possession
of
his
land
and
engage
him
in
war
25
This
day
I
will
start
to
put
the
dread
and
the
fear
of
you
upon
all
the
people
under
the
heavens
who
hear
the
report
about
you
They
will
be
disturbed
and
will
tremble
because
of
you
26
Then
I
sent
messengers
from
the
wilderness
of
Kedemoth
to
King
Sihon
of
Heshbon
with
these
peaceful
words
27
Let
me
pass
through
your
land
I
will
remain
on
the
road
and
not
turn
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
28
I
will
eat
only
the
food
and
drink
only
the
water
that
you
will
sell
to
me
Just
allow
me
to
pass
through
on
foot
29
—that
is
what
the
descendants
of
Esau
dwelling
in
Seir
and
the
Moabites
dwelling
in
Ar
did
for
me—until
I
pass
over
the
Jordan
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
our
God
is
giving
to
us
30
But
King
Sihon
of
Heshbon
did
not
let
us
pass
through
because
Jehovah
your
God
allowed
his
spirit
to
become
obstinate
and
his
heart
to
become
hard
in
order
to
give
him
into
your
hand
as
is
now
the
case
31
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
See
I
have
already
begun
to
give
Sihon
and
his
land
over
to
you
Start
to
take
possession
of
his
land
32
When
Sihon
came
out
along
with
all
his
people
to
meet
us
in
battle
at
Jahaz
33
Jehovah
our
God
handed
him
over
to
us
so
that
we
defeated
him
his
sons
and
all
his
people
34
We
captured
all
his
cities
at
that
time
and
devoted
every
city
to
destruction
including
men
women
and
children
We
left
no
survivor
35
We
plundered
only
the
livestock
for
ourselves
along
with
the
spoils
from
the
cities
that
we
had
captured
36
From
Aroer
which
is
on
the
rim
of
the
Arnon
Valley
including
the
city
that
is
in
the
valley
as
far
as
Gilead
no
town
was
beyond
our
reach
Jehovah
our
God
handed
them
all
over
to
us
37
However
you
did
not
approach
the
land
of
the
Ammonites
the
whole
bank
of
the
Valley
of
Jabbok
and
the
cities
of
the
mountainous
region
or
any
other
place
forbidden
by
Jehovah
our
God
1
Then
we
turned
and
went
up
by
way
of
Bashan
And
Og
the
king
of
Bashan
came
out
with
all
his
people
to
meet
us
in
battle
at
Edrei
2
So
Jehovah
said
to
me
Do
not
be
afraid
of
him
for
I
will
give
him
and
all
his
people
and
his
land
into
your
hand
and
you
will
do
to
him
just
as
you
did
to
Sihon
the
king
of
the
Amorites
who
lived
in
Heshbon
3
So
Jehovah
our
God
also
gave
King
Og
of
Bashan
and
all
his
people
into
our
hand
and
we
kept
striking
him
down
until
none
of
his
people
survived
4
We
then
captured
all
his
cities
There
was
no
town
that
we
did
not
take
from
them—60
cities
all
the
region
of
Argob
the
kingdom
of
Og
in
Bashan
5
All
these
cities
were
fortified
with
high
walls
gates
and
bars
along
with
a
great
number
of
rural
towns
6
However
we
devoted
them
to
destruction
just
as
we
had
done
to
King
Sihon
of
Heshbon
in
devoting
every
city
to
destruction
including
men
women
and
children
7
And
we
took
all
the
livestock
and
the
spoil
of
the
cities
for
ourselves
8
At
that
time
we
seized
the
land
of
the
two
Amorite
kings
who
were
in
the
region
of
the
Jordan
from
the
Arnon
Valley
as
far
as
Mount
Hermon
9
the
mountain
that
the
Sidonians
used
to
call
Sirion
and
the
Amorites
used
to
call
Senir
10
all
the
cities
of
the
tableland
all
Gilead
and
all
Bashan
as
far
as
Salecah
and
Edrei
the
cities
of
the
kingdom
that
belonged
to
Og
in
Bashan
11
For
King
Og
of
Bashan
was
the
last
remaining
one
of
the
Rephaim
His
bier
was
made
of
iron
and
it
is
still
in
Rabbah
of
the
Ammonites
It
is
nine
cubits
long
and
four
cubits
wide
by
the
standard
cubit
12
At
that
time
we
took
possession
of
this
land
from
Aroer
which
is
by
the
Arnon
Valley
and
half
of
the
mountainous
region
of
Gilead
and
I
have
given
its
cities
to
the
Reubenites
and
the
Gadites
13
And
the
rest
of
Gilead
and
all
Bashan
of
the
kingdom
of
Og
I
have
given
to
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
All
the
region
of
Argob
which
belongs
to
Bashan
was
known
as
the
land
of
the
Rephaim
14
Jair
the
son
of
Manasseh
took
all
the
region
of
Argob
as
far
as
the
boundary
of
the
Geshurites
and
the
Maacathites
and
named
those
villages
of
Bashan
after
himself
Havvoth-jair
to
this
day
15
And
I
have
given
Gilead
to
Machir
16
And
to
the
Reubenites
and
the
Gadites
I
have
given
from
Gilead
to
the
Arnon
Valley
with
the
middle
of
the
valley
as
a
boundary
and
as
far
as
Jabbok
the
valley
that
is
the
boundary
of
the
Ammonites
17
and
the
Arabah
and
the
Jordan
and
the
border
from
Chinnereth
to
the
Sea
of
the
Arabah
the
Salt
Sea
at
the
base
of
the
slopes
of
Pisgah
toward
the
east
18
I
then
gave
you
this
command
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
this
land
to
take
possession
of
it
All
your
valiant
men
will
take
up
arms
and
cross
over
before
your
brothers
the
Israelites
19
Only
your
wives
your
children
and
your
livestock
I
well
know
that
you
have
a
great
deal
of
livestock
will
continue
dwelling
in
the
cities
that
I
have
given
you
20
until
Jehovah
gives
your
brothers
rest
as
he
does
for
you
and
they
also
have
taken
possession
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
will
give
them
across
the
Jordan
Then
you
will
come
back
each
one
to
his
possession
that
I
have
given
you
21
At
that
time
I
gave
this
command
to
Joshua
You
have
seen
with
your
own
eyes
what
Jehovah
your
God
has
done
to
these
two
kings
Jehovah
will
do
the
same
thing
to
all
the
kingdoms
into
which
you
will
cross
over
22
You
must
not
be
afraid
of
them
for
Jehovah
your
God
is
the
one
fighting
for
you
23
At
that
time
I
pleaded
with
Jehovah
saying
24
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
you
have
begun
to
show
your
servant
your
greatness
and
your
mighty
arm
for
what
god
in
the
heavens
or
on
the
earth
performs
such
mighty
deeds
as
you
25
Please
let
me
pass
over
and
see
the
good
land
that
is
across
the
Jordan
this
good
mountainous
region
and
Lebanon
26
But
Jehovah
was
still
furious
with
me
because
of
you
and
he
would
not
listen
to
me
Rather
Jehovah
said
to
me
Enough
from
you
Never
speak
to
me
again
about
this
matter
27
Go
up
to
the
top
of
Pisgah
and
look
to
the
west
and
north
and
south
and
east
and
view
the
land
with
your
eyes
for
you
will
not
cross
over
this
Jordan
28
Commission
Joshua
and
encourage
him
and
strengthen
him
because
he
is
the
one
who
will
cross
over
before
this
people
and
he
is
the
one
who
will
cause
them
to
inherit
the
land
that
you
will
see
29
All
this
happened
while
we
were
dwelling
in
the
valley
in
front
of
Beth-peor
1
Now
O
Israel
listen
to
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
I
am
teaching
you
to
observe
so
that
you
may
live
and
go
in
and
take
possession
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
is
giving
you
2
You
must
not
add
to
the
word
that
I
am
commanding
you
neither
must
you
take
away
from
it
so
as
to
keep
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
your
God
that
I
am
commanding
you
3
Your
own
eyes
have
seen
what
Jehovah
did
in
the
case
of
the
Baal
of
Peor
Jehovah
your
God
annihilated
from
your
midst
every
man
who
walked
after
the
Baal
of
Peor
4
But
you
who
are
holding
fast
to
Jehovah
your
God
are
all
alive
today
5
See
I
have
taught
you
regulations
and
judicial
decisions
just
as
Jehovah
my
God
has
commanded
me
so
that
you
may
observe
them
in
the
land
you
will
take
possession
of
6
You
must
carefully
follow
them
because
this
will
show
wisdom
and
understanding
on
your
part
before
the
peoples
who
will
hear
about
all
these
regulations
and
they
will
say
This
great
nation
is
undoubtedly
a
wise
and
understanding
people
7
For
what
great
nation
has
gods
as
near
to
it
as
Jehovah
our
God
is
to
us
whenever
we
call
on
him
8
And
what
great
nation
has
righteous
regulations
and
judicial
decisions
like
this
entire
Law
that
I
am
putting
before
you
today
9
Just
be
careful
and
watch
yourself
closely
so
that
you
may
not
forget
the
things
that
your
eyes
have
seen
and
so
that
they
may
not
depart
from
your
heart
all
the
days
of
your
life
You
must
also
make
them
known
to
your
sons
and
to
your
grandsons
10
On
the
day
that
you
stood
before
Jehovah
your
God
in
Horeb
Jehovah
said
to
me
Congregate
the
people
together
to
me
so
that
I
may
let
them
hear
my
words
in
order
that
they
may
learn
to
fear
me
all
the
days
that
they
are
alive
on
the
ground
and
that
they
may
teach
their
sons
11
So
you
came
near
and
stood
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
the
mountain
was
burning
with
fire
up
to
the
very
heavens
there
was
darkness
cloud
and
thick
gloom
12
And
Jehovah
began
to
speak
to
you
out
of
the
fire
You
heard
the
sound
of
words
but
you
saw
no
form—there
was
only
a
voice
13
And
he
declared
his
covenant
to
you
which
he
commanded
you
to
observe—the
Ten
Commandments
Afterward
he
wrote
them
on
two
tablets
of
stone
14
At
that
time
Jehovah
commanded
me
to
teach
you
regulations
and
judicial
decisions
which
you
are
to
observe
in
the
land
you
will
enter
to
take
possession
of
15
Therefore
watch
yourselves
closely—since
you
did
not
see
any
form
on
the
day
Jehovah
spoke
to
you
in
Horeb
out
of
the
middle
of
the
fire—
16
that
you
may
not
act
corruptly
by
making
for
yourselves
any
carved
image
having
the
form
of
any
symbol
the
representation
of
male
or
female
17
the
representation
of
any
animal
on
the
earth
or
the
representation
of
any
bird
that
flies
in
the
sky
18
the
representation
of
anything
creeping
on
the
ground
or
the
representation
of
any
fish
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
19
And
when
you
raise
your
eyes
to
the
heavens
and
see
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars—all
the
army
of
the
heavens—do
not
get
seduced
and
bow
down
to
them
and
serve
them
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
them
to
all
the
peoples
under
the
whole
heavens
20
But
you
are
the
ones
Jehovah
took
and
brought
out
of
the
iron-smelting
furnace
out
of
Egypt
to
become
the
people
of
his
personal
possession
as
you
are
today
21
Jehovah
became
angry
with
me
because
of
you
and
he
swore
that
I
should
not
cross
the
Jordan
or
go
into
the
good
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
as
an
inheritance
22
For
I
am
to
die
in
this
land
I
will
not
cross
the
Jordan
but
you
will
cross
over
and
take
possession
of
this
good
land
23
Be
careful
that
you
do
not
forget
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
your
God
that
he
made
with
you
and
do
not
make
for
yourselves
a
carved
image
the
form
of
anything
forbidden
to
you
by
Jehovah
your
God
24
For
Jehovah
your
God
is
a
consuming
fire
a
God
who
requires
exclusive
devotion
25
If
you
become
father
to
sons
and
grandsons
and
you
have
lived
a
long
time
in
the
land
and
you
act
ruinously
and
make
a
carved
image
of
any
kind
and
you
do
what
is
evil
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
your
God
so
as
to
offend
him
26
I
do
take
the
heavens
and
the
earth
as
witnesses
against
you
today
that
you
will
surely
and
quickly
perish
from
the
land
that
you
are
crossing
the
Jordan
to
take
possession
of
You
will
not
last
long
on
it
but
you
will
be
utterly
annihilated
27
Jehovah
will
scatter
you
among
the
peoples
and
just
a
few
of
you
will
survive
among
the
nations
to
which
Jehovah
will
have
driven
you
28
There
you
will
have
to
serve
gods
of
wood
and
stone
made
by
human
hands
gods
that
cannot
see
or
hear
or
eat
or
smell
29
If
you
search
for
Jehovah
your
God
from
there
you
will
certainly
find
him
if
you
inquire
for
him
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul
30
When
you
are
in
great
distress
and
all
these
things
have
happened
to
you
in
later
times
then
you
will
return
to
Jehovah
your
God
and
listen
to
his
voice
31
For
Jehovah
your
God
is
a
merciful
God
He
will
not
desert
you
or
bring
you
to
ruin
or
forget
the
covenant
that
he
swore
to
your
forefathers
32
Ask
now
about
the
former
days
before
your
time
from
the
day
when
God
created
man
on
the
earth
search
from
one
end
of
the
heavens
to
the
other
end
of
the
heavens
Has
anything
so
great
ever
happened
or
has
anything
like
it
ever
been
heard
of
33
Have
any
other
people
heard
the
voice
of
God
speaking
out
of
the
fire
the
way
you
have
heard
it
and
kept
on
living
34
Or
has
God
ever
attempted
to
take
for
himself
a
nation
out
of
the
midst
of
another
nation
along
with
judgments
with
signs
with
miracles
with
war
with
a
mighty
hand
with
an
outstretched
arm
and
with
terrifying
deeds
as
Jehovah
your
God
did
for
you
in
Egypt
before
your
very
eyes
35
You
yourselves
have
been
shown
these
things
so
you
will
know
that
Jehovah
is
the
true
God
there
is
no
other
besides
him
36
He
made
you
hear
his
voice
from
the
heavens
to
correct
you
and
on
the
earth
he
made
you
see
his
great
fire
and
his
words
you
heard
from
out
of
the
fire
37
Because
he
loved
your
forefathers
and
has
chosen
their
offspring
after
them
you
were
brought
out
of
Egypt
in
his
presence
by
his
great
power
38
From
before
you
he
drove
away
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
you
to
bring
you
in
and
give
you
their
land
as
an
inheritance
as
it
is
today
39
Know
therefore
on
this
day
and
take
it
to
heart
that
Jehovah
is
the
true
God
in
the
heavens
above
and
on
the
earth
beneath
There
is
no
other
40
You
must
keep
his
regulations
and
his
commandments
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
in
order
that
it
may
go
well
with
you
and
your
sons
after
you
so
that
you
may
long
remain
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
41
At
that
time
Moses
set
apart
three
cities
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
Jordan
42
If
any
manslayer
unintentionally
kills
his
fellow
man
and
he
did
not
previously
hate
him
he
must
flee
to
one
of
these
cities
and
live
43
The
cities
are
Bezer
in
the
wilderness
on
the
tableland
for
the
Reubenites
Ramoth
in
Gilead
for
the
Gadites
and
Golan
in
Bashan
for
the
Manassites
44
Now
this
is
the
Law
that
Moses
set
before
the
people
of
Israel
45
These
are
the
reminders
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
Moses
gave
to
the
Israelites
after
they
came
out
of
Egypt
46
in
the
region
of
the
Jordan
in
the
valley
opposite
Beth-peor
in
the
land
of
King
Sihon
of
the
Amorites
who
was
dwelling
in
Heshbon
whom
Moses
and
the
Israelites
defeated
after
coming
out
of
Egypt
47
And
they
took
possession
of
his
land
and
of
the
land
of
King
Og
of
Bashan
the
two
kings
of
the
Amorites
who
were
in
the
region
east
of
the
Jordan
48
from
Aroer
which
is
on
the
rim
of
the
Arnon
Valley
up
to
Mount
Sion
that
is
Hermon
49
and
all
the
Arabah
in
the
region
east
of
the
Jordan
and
as
far
as
the
Sea
of
the
Arabah
at
the
base
of
the
slopes
of
Pisgah
1
Moses
then
summoned
all
Israel
and
said
to
them
Hear
O
Israel
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
I
am
announcing
to
you
today
and
you
must
learn
them
and
carefully
observe
them
2
Jehovah
our
God
made
a
covenant
with
us
in
Horeb
3
It
was
not
with
our
forefathers
that
Jehovah
made
this
covenant
but
with
us
all
of
us
alive
here
today
4
Jehovah
spoke
face-to-face
with
you
in
the
mountain
out
of
the
fire
5
I
was
standing
between
Jehovah
and
you
at
that
time
to
convey
to
you
the
word
of
Jehovah
for
you
were
afraid
because
of
the
fire
and
did
not
go
up
the
mountain
He
said
6
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
out
of
the
house
of
slavery
7
You
must
never
have
any
other
gods
besides
me
8
You
must
not
make
for
yourself
a
carved
image
or
a
form
like
anything
that
is
in
the
heavens
above
or
on
the
earth
below
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
9
You
must
not
bow
down
to
them
nor
be
led
to
serve
them
for
I
Jehovah
your
God
am
a
God
who
requires
exclusive
devotion
bringing
punishment
for
the
error
of
fathers
upon
sons
upon
the
third
generation
and
upon
the
fourth
generation
of
those
who
hate
me
10
but
showing
loyal
love
to
the
thousandth
generation
of
those
who
love
me
and
keep
my
commandments
11
You
must
not
take
up
the
name
of
Jehovah
your
God
in
a
worthless
way
for
Jehovah
will
not
leave
anyone
unpunished
who
takes
up
his
name
in
a
worthless
way
12
Observe
the
Sabbath
day
to
keep
it
sacred
just
as
Jehovah
your
God
commanded
you
13
You
are
to
labor
and
do
all
your
work
in
six
days
14
but
the
seventh
day
is
a
sabbath
to
Jehovah
your
God
You
must
not
do
any
work
neither
you
nor
your
son
nor
your
daughter
nor
your
slave
man
nor
your
slave
girl
nor
your
bull
nor
your
donkey
nor
any
of
your
domestic
animals
nor
your
foreign
resident
who
is
inside
your
cities
in
order
that
your
slave
man
and
your
slave
girl
may
rest
the
same
as
you
15
Remember
that
you
became
a
slave
in
the
land
of
Egypt
and
that
Jehovah
your
God
brought
you
out
of
there
with
a
mighty
hand
and
an
outstretched
arm
That
is
why
Jehovah
your
God
commanded
you
to
observe
the
Sabbath
day
16
Honor
your
father
and
your
mother
just
as
Jehovah
your
God
has
commanded
you
so
that
you
may
live
a
long
time
and
you
may
prosper
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
17
You
must
not
murder
18
Neither
must
you
commit
adultery
19
Neither
must
you
steal
20
Neither
must
you
testify
to
a
falsehood
against
your
fellow
man
21
Neither
must
you
desire
your
fellow
mans
wife
Neither
must
you
selfishly
desire
your
fellow
mans
house
nor
his
field
nor
his
slave
man
nor
his
slave
girl
nor
his
bull
nor
his
donkey
nor
anything
that
belongs
to
your
fellow
man
22
These
commandments
Jehovah
spoke
to
all
your
congregation
on
the
mountain
out
of
the
fire
the
cloud
and
the
thick
gloom
with
a
loud
voice
and
he
added
nothing
further
then
he
wrote
them
on
two
tablets
of
stone
and
gave
them
to
me
23
But
as
soon
as
you
had
heard
the
voice
out
of
the
darkness
while
the
mountain
was
burning
with
fire
all
the
heads
of
your
tribes
and
the
elders
approached
me
24
Then
you
said
Here
Jehovah
our
God
has
shown
us
his
glory
and
his
greatness
and
we
have
heard
his
voice
out
of
the
fire
Today
we
have
seen
that
God
can
speak
with
man
and
he
can
keep
living
25
Now
why
should
we
die
For
this
great
fire
may
consume
us
If
we
continue
hearing
the
voice
of
Jehovah
our
God
we
are
sure
to
die
26
For
who
is
there
of
all
flesh
who
has
heard
the
voice
of
the
living
God
speaking
out
of
the
fire
as
we
did
and
yet
goes
on
living
27
You
yourself
must
go
near
to
hear
all
that
Jehovah
our
God
will
say
and
you
will
be
the
one
to
tell
us
all
that
Jehovah
our
God
says
to
you
and
we
will
listen
and
do
it
28
So
Jehovah
heard
the
words
you
spoke
to
me
and
Jehovah
said
to
me
I
have
heard
the
words
that
this
people
have
spoken
to
you
All
they
have
said
is
good
29
If
only
they
would
always
have
a
heart
inclined
to
fear
me
and
to
keep
all
my
commandments
then
it
would
go
well
with
them
and
their
sons
forever
30
Go
say
to
them
Return
to
your
tents
31
But
you
should
stay
here
with
me
and
let
me
tell
you
all
the
commandments
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
you
should
teach
to
them
and
that
they
are
to
observe
in
the
land
that
I
am
giving
them
to
take
possession
of
32
Now
you
people
should
be
careful
to
do
just
as
Jehovah
your
God
has
commanded
you
You
must
not
turn
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
33
You
should
walk
in
all
the
way
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
commanded
you
in
order
that
you
may
live
and
prosper
and
prolong
your
days
in
the
land
that
you
will
take
possession
of
1
Now
these
are
the
commandments
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
to
teach
you
so
that
you
may
observe
them
when
you
cross
over
into
the
land
that
you
are
to
take
possession
of
2
in
order
that
you
may
fear
Jehovah
your
God
and
keep
all
his
statutes
and
his
commandments
that
I
am
commanding
you—you
and
your
son
and
your
grandson—all
the
days
of
your
life
so
that
you
may
live
a
long
time
3
And
you
must
listen
O
Israel
and
carefully
observe
them
so
that
you
may
prosper
and
become
very
many
in
the
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
just
as
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
has
promised
you
4
Listen
O
Israel
Jehovah
our
God
is
one
Jehovah
5
You
must
love
Jehovah
your
God
with
all
your
heart
and
all
your
soul
and
all
your
strength
6
These
words
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
must
be
on
your
heart
7
and
you
must
inculcate
them
in
your
sons
and
speak
of
them
when
you
sit
in
your
house
and
when
you
walk
on
the
road
and
when
you
lie
down
and
when
you
get
up
8
Tie
them
as
a
reminder
on
your
hand
and
they
must
be
like
a
headband
on
your
forehead
9
Write
them
on
the
doorposts
of
your
house
and
on
your
gates
10
When
Jehovah
your
God
brings
you
into
the
land
that
he
swore
to
your
forefathers
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
to
give
you—great
and
fine
cities
that
you
did
not
build
11
houses
full
of
all
sorts
of
good
things
that
you
did
not
work
for
hewn
cisterns
that
you
did
not
dig
and
vineyards
and
olive
trees
that
you
did
not
plant—and
you
have
eaten
and
become
satisfied
12
be
careful
not
to
forget
Jehovah
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
out
of
the
house
of
slavery
13
Jehovah
your
God
you
should
fear
and
him
you
should
serve
and
by
his
name
you
should
swear
14
You
must
not
follow
after
other
gods
any
gods
of
the
peoples
who
are
all
around
you
15
for
Jehovah
your
God
who
is
in
your
midst
is
a
God
who
requires
exclusive
devotion
Otherwise
the
anger
of
Jehovah
your
God
will
blaze
against
you
and
he
will
annihilate
you
from
the
face
of
the
earth
16
You
must
not
put
Jehovah
your
God
to
the
test
the
way
you
put
him
to
the
test
at
Massah
17
You
should
diligently
observe
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
his
reminders
and
his
regulations
that
he
has
commanded
you
to
observe
18
You
must
do
what
is
right
and
good
in
Jehovahs
eyes
in
order
that
you
may
prosper
and
that
you
may
enter
and
take
possession
of
the
good
land
about
which
Jehovah
has
sworn
to
your
forefathers
19
by
driving
out
all
your
enemies
from
before
you
just
as
Jehovah
has
promised
20
In
the
future
when
your
son
asks
you
What
is
the
meaning
of
the
reminders
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
Jehovah
our
God
has
commanded
you
21
then
you
will
say
to
your
son
We
became
slaves
to
Pharaoh
in
Egypt
but
Jehovah
brought
us
out
of
Egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
22
So
before
our
eyes
Jehovah
kept
sending
signs
and
miracles
great
and
devastating
upon
Egypt
upon
Pharaoh
and
upon
all
his
household
23
And
he
brought
us
out
from
there
in
order
to
bring
us
here
to
give
us
the
land
about
which
he
had
sworn
to
our
forefathers
24
Then
Jehovah
commanded
us
to
carry
out
all
these
regulations
and
to
fear
Jehovah
our
God
for
our
lasting
good
so
that
we
could
keep
alive
as
we
are
today
25
And
it
will
mean
righteousness
for
us
if
we
are
careful
to
observe
all
these
commandments
in
obedience
to
Jehovah
our
God
just
as
he
has
commanded
us
1
When
Jehovah
your
God
brings
you
into
the
land
you
are
about
to
enter
and
take
possession
of
he
will
also
clear
away
populous
nations
from
before
you
the
Hittites
the
Girgashites
the
Amorites
the
Canaanites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
seven
nations
more
populous
and
mightier
than
you
are
2
Jehovah
your
God
will
give
them
over
to
you
and
you
will
defeat
them
You
should
without
fail
devote
them
to
destruction
You
must
not
make
any
covenant
with
them
nor
show
them
any
favor
3
You
must
not
form
any
marriage
alliances
with
them
Do
not
give
your
daughters
to
their
sons
or
take
their
daughters
for
your
sons
4
For
they
will
turn
your
sons
away
from
following
me
to
serve
other
gods
then
Jehovahs
anger
will
blaze
against
you
and
he
will
swiftly
annihilate
you
5
Instead
this
is
what
you
should
do
to
them
Tear
down
their
altars
break
up
their
sacred
pillars
cut
down
their
sacred
poles
and
burn
up
their
graven
images
6
For
you
are
a
holy
people
to
Jehovah
your
God
and
Jehovah
your
God
has
chosen
you
to
become
his
people
his
special
property
out
of
all
the
peoples
who
are
on
the
face
of
the
earth
7
It
was
not
because
you
were
the
most
numerous
of
all
the
peoples
that
Jehovah
showed
affection
for
you
and
chose
you
for
you
were
the
smallest
of
all
the
peoples
8
Rather
it
was
because
of
Jehovahs
love
for
you
and
because
he
kept
the
oath
that
he
had
sworn
to
your
forefathers
that
Jehovah
brought
you
out
with
a
mighty
hand
to
redeem
you
from
the
house
of
slavery
from
the
power
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
9
You
well
know
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
the
true
God
the
faithful
God
keeping
his
covenant
and
loyal
love
to
a
thousand
generations
of
those
who
love
him
and
keep
his
commandments
10
But
those
who
hate
him
he
will
repay
to
their
face
with
destruction
He
will
not
be
slow
to
deal
with
those
who
hate
him
he
will
repay
them
to
their
face
11
Therefore
take
care
to
keep
the
commandments
and
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
by
observing
them
12
If
you
continue
listening
to
these
judicial
decisions
and
you
observe
them
and
carry
them
out
Jehovah
your
God
will
keep
the
covenant
and
the
loyal
love
about
which
he
swore
to
your
forefathers
13
He
will
love
you
and
bless
you
and
multiply
you
Yes
he
will
bless
you
with
many
children
and
with
the
produce
of
your
soil
your
grain
your
new
wine
your
oil
the
calves
of
your
herds
and
the
lambs
of
your
flocks
in
the
land
that
he
swore
to
your
forefathers
to
give
to
you
14
You
will
become
the
most
blessed
of
all
the
peoples
no
man
or
woman
among
you
will
be
childless
nor
will
your
livestock
be
without
young
15
Jehovah
will
take
away
from
you
all
sickness
and
he
will
not
bring
upon
you
any
of
the
terrible
diseases
that
you
have
known
in
Egypt
Instead
he
will
bring
them
upon
all
those
who
hate
you
16
You
are
to
destroy
all
the
peoples
whom
Jehovah
your
God
gives
over
to
you
You
must
not
feel
sorry
for
them
and
you
must
not
serve
their
gods
because
that
would
be
a
snare
to
you
17
If
you
should
say
in
your
heart
These
nations
outnumber
us
How
can
I
drive
them
away
18
you
must
not
be
afraid
of
them
You
should
remind
yourself
of
what
Jehovah
your
God
did
to
Pharaoh
and
all
Egypt
19
the
great
judgments
that
your
eyes
saw
and
the
signs
and
the
miracles
and
the
mighty
hand
and
the
outstretched
arm
with
which
Jehovah
your
God
brought
you
out
That
is
what
Jehovah
your
God
will
do
to
all
the
peoples
you
fear
20
Jehovah
your
God
will
send
the
feeling
of
dejection
upon
them
until
those
who
were
left
remaining
and
who
were
concealing
themselves
from
before
you
perish
21
Do
not
be
struck
with
terror
because
of
them
for
Jehovah
your
God
is
with
you
a
great
and
awe-inspiring
God
22
Jehovah
your
God
will
certainly
drive
these
nations
away
from
before
you
little
by
little
You
will
not
be
allowed
to
put
an
end
to
them
quickly
so
that
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
will
not
multiply
against
you
23
Jehovah
your
God
will
give
them
over
to
you
and
utterly
defeat
them
until
they
are
annihilated
24
He
will
give
their
kings
into
your
hand
and
you
will
wipe
out
their
names
from
under
the
heavens
Nobody
will
stand
up
to
you
until
you
have
exterminated
them
25
You
should
burn
the
graven
images
of
their
gods
in
the
fire
Do
not
desire
the
silver
and
the
gold
on
them
or
take
it
for
yourself
so
that
you
are
not
ensnared
by
it
for
it
is
something
detestable
to
Jehovah
your
God
26
You
must
not
bring
a
detestable
thing
into
your
house
and
thereby
become
something
devoted
to
destruction
like
it
You
should
utterly
loathe
it
and
absolutely
detest
it
because
it
is
something
devoted
to
destruction
1
You
should
be
careful
to
observe
every
commandment
that
I
am
giving
you
today
so
that
you
may
continue
living
and
multiply
and
go
in
and
take
possession
of
the
land
about
which
Jehovah
swore
to
your
forefathers
2
Remember
the
long
road
that
Jehovah
your
God
made
you
walk
these
40
years
in
the
wilderness
to
humble
you
and
to
put
you
to
the
test
so
as
to
know
what
was
in
your
heart
whether
you
would
keep
his
commandments
or
not
3
So
he
humbled
you
and
let
you
go
hungry
and
fed
you
with
the
manna
which
neither
you
had
known
nor
your
fathers
had
known
in
order
to
make
you
know
that
man
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
man
lives
by
every
expression
from
Jehovahs
mouth
4
The
clothing
you
wore
did
not
wear
out
nor
did
your
feet
become
swollen
these
40
years
5
You
well
know
in
your
heart
that
just
as
a
man
corrects
his
son
Jehovah
your
God
was
correcting
you
6
Now
you
must
keep
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
your
God
by
walking
in
his
ways
and
by
fearing
him
7
For
Jehovah
your
God
is
bringing
you
into
a
good
land
a
land
of
streams
of
water
springs
and
fountains
flowing
in
the
valley
plain
and
in
the
mountainous
region
8
a
land
of
wheat
and
barley
of
grapevines
fig
trees
and
pomegranates
a
land
of
olive
oil
and
honey
9
a
land
where
food
will
not
be
scarce
and
you
will
lack
nothing
a
land
where
the
stones
contain
iron
and
from
its
mountains
you
will
mine
copper
10
When
you
have
eaten
and
are
satisfied
you
must
praise
Jehovah
your
God
for
the
good
land
that
he
has
given
you
11
Be
careful
not
to
forget
Jehovah
your
God
by
failing
to
keep
his
commandments
his
judicial
decisions
and
his
statutes
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
12
When
you
eat
and
are
satisfied
and
you
build
fine
houses
and
dwell
in
them
13
when
your
herd
and
your
flocks
multiply
and
your
silver
and
gold
increase
and
you
have
an
abundance
of
everything
14
do
not
let
your
heart
become
proud
and
cause
you
to
forget
Jehovah
your
God
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
out
of
the
house
of
slavery
15
who
caused
you
to
walk
through
the
great
and
fearsome
wilderness
with
poisonous
serpents
and
scorpions
and
with
parched
ground
that
has
no
water
He
made
water
flow
out
of
the
flinty
rock
16
and
fed
you
with
manna
in
the
wilderness
which
your
fathers
had
not
known
in
order
to
humble
you
and
to
put
you
to
the
test
so
as
to
benefit
you
in
the
future
17
If
you
should
say
in
your
heart
My
own
power
and
the
strength
of
my
own
hand
have
produced
this
wealth
for
me

18
remember
that
it
is
Jehovah
your
God
who
gives
power
to
you
to
make
wealth
in
order
to
carry
out
his
covenant
that
he
swore
to
your
forefathers
as
it
is
today
19
If
you
should
ever
forget
Jehovah
your
God
and
you
walk
after
other
gods
and
serve
them
and
bow
down
to
them
I
do
bear
witness
against
you
today
that
you
will
surely
perish
20
Like
the
nations
that
Jehovah
is
destroying
before
you
that
is
how
you
will
perish
because
you
would
not
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
1
Hear
O
Israel
today
you
are
crossing
the
Jordan
to
go
in
and
dispossess
nations
greater
and
mightier
than
you
cities
great
and
fortified
to
the
heavens
2
a
people
great
and
tall
the
sons
of
the
Anakim
about
whom
you
know
and
have
heard
it
said
Who
can
stand
up
to
the
sons
of
Anak
3
Therefore
you
should
know
this
day
that
Jehovah
your
God
will
cross
ahead
of
you
He
is
a
consuming
fire
and
he
will
annihilate
them
He
will
subdue
them
before
your
eyes
so
that
you
may
quickly
drive
them
out
and
destroy
them
just
as
Jehovah
has
promised
you
4
Do
not
say
in
your
heart
when
Jehovah
your
God
drives
them
away
from
before
you
It
was
because
of
my
own
righteousness
that
Jehovah
has
brought
me
in
to
take
possession
of
this
land
Rather
it
is
because
of
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
that
Jehovah
is
driving
them
away
from
before
you
5
It
is
not
because
of
your
righteousness
or
the
uprightness
of
your
heart
that
you
are
going
in
to
take
possession
of
their
land
Instead
it
is
because
of
the
wickedness
of
these
nations
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
driving
them
away
from
before
you
and
in
order
to
carry
out
the
word
that
Jehovah
swore
to
your
forefathers
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
6
Know
then
that
it
is
not
because
of
your
righteousness
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
this
good
land
to
take
possession
of
because
you
are
an
obstinate
people
7
Remember—never
forget—the
way
you
provoked
Jehovah
your
God
in
the
wilderness
From
the
day
that
you
left
the
land
of
Egypt
until
your
coming
to
this
place
you
have
rebelled
against
Jehovah
8
Even
in
Horeb
you
provoked
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
was
so
angry
with
you
that
he
was
ready
to
annihilate
you
9
When
I
went
up
the
mountain
to
receive
the
stone
tablets
the
tablets
of
the
covenant
that
Jehovah
made
with
you
I
remained
on
the
mountain
40
days
and
40
nights
eating
no
food
and
drinking
no
water
10
Then
Jehovah
gave
me
the
two
tablets
of
stone
written
on
with
Gods
finger
and
on
them
were
all
the
words
that
Jehovah
had
spoken
to
you
on
the
mountain
out
of
the
fire
in
the
day
of
the
assembly
11
At
the
end
of
the
40
days
and
40
nights
Jehovah
gave
me
the
two
tablets
of
stone
the
tablets
of
the
covenant
12
and
Jehovah
told
me
Get
up
go
down
quickly
from
here
because
your
people
whom
you
brought
out
of
Egypt
have
acted
corruptly
They
have
quickly
turned
aside
from
the
path
I
commanded
them
to
follow
They
have
made
a
metal
image
for
themselves
13
Jehovah
then
said
to
me
I
have
seen
this
people
and
look
it
is
an
obstinate
people
14
Let
me
be
and
I
will
annihilate
them
and
wipe
out
their
name
from
under
the
heavens
and
let
me
make
you
a
nation
mightier
and
more
numerous
than
they
are
15
Then
I
turned
and
went
down
the
mountain
while
the
mountain
was
burning
with
fire
and
the
two
tablets
of
the
covenant
were
in
both
my
hands
16
Then
I
looked
and
saw
that
you
had
sinned
against
Jehovah
your
God
You
had
made
a
metal
calf
for
yourselves
You
had
turned
aside
quickly
from
the
path
Jehovah
had
commanded
you
to
follow
17
So
I
took
hold
of
the
two
tablets
and
threw
them
down
with
both
my
hands
and
shattered
them
before
your
eyes
18
Then
I
prostrated
myself
before
Jehovah
as
at
first
for
40
days
and
40
nights
I
neither
ate
food
nor
drank
water
because
of
all
the
sins
that
you
had
committed
by
your
doing
what
was
evil
in
Jehovahs
eyes
and
offending
him
19
For
I
was
terrified
because
of
Jehovahs
great
anger
against
you
in
that
he
was
ready
to
annihilate
you
However
Jehovah
listened
to
me
that
time
also
20
Jehovah
was
so
angry
with
Aaron
that
he
was
ready
to
annihilate
him
but
I
made
supplication
for
Aaron
at
that
time
also
21
Then
I
took
the
sinful
thing
you
made
the
calf
and
burned
it
up
in
the
fire
I
crushed
it
and
ground
it
thoroughly
until
it
was
fine
like
dust
and
I
threw
the
dust
into
the
stream
that
flows
down
from
the
mountain
22
Further
at
Taberah
at
Massah
and
at
Kibroth-hattaavah
you
also
provoked
Jehovah
to
anger
23
When
Jehovah
sent
you
out
of
Kadesh-barnea
and
said
Go
up
and
take
possession
of
the
land
that
I
will
certainly
give
you
you
again
rebelled
against
the
order
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
you
did
not
exercise
faith
in
him
and
did
not
obey
him
24
You
have
rebelled
against
Jehovah
ever
since
I
have
known
you
25
So
I
kept
prostrating
myself
before
Jehovah
40
days
and
40
nights
for
I
prostrated
myself
in
this
way
because
Jehovah
said
he
would
annihilate
you
26
I
began
to
make
supplication
to
Jehovah
and
to
say
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
do
not
bring
your
people
to
ruin
They
are
your
personal
possession
whom
you
redeemed
through
your
greatness
and
brought
out
of
Egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
27
Remember
your
servants
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
Do
not
pay
attention
to
the
stubbornness
of
this
people
their
wickedness
and
their
sin
28
Otherwise
the
people
of
the
land
from
which
you
brought
us
may
say
Jehovah
was
unable
to
bring
them
into
the
land
that
he
promised
them
and
because
he
hated
them
he
brought
them
out
to
put
them
to
death
in
the
wilderness
29
For
they
are
your
people
and
your
personal
possession
whom
you
brought
out
with
your
great
power
and
your
outstretched
arm
1
At
that
time
Jehovah
said
to
me
Carve
out
for
yourself
two
tablets
of
stone
like
the
first
ones
and
come
up
to
me
on
the
mountain
also
you
must
make
for
yourself
an
ark
of
wood
2
And
I
will
write
on
the
tablets
the
words
that
appeared
on
the
first
tablets
which
you
shattered
and
you
should
place
them
in
the
ark
3
So
I
made
an
ark
of
acacia
wood
and
carved
out
two
tablets
of
stone
like
the
first
ones
and
went
up
the
mountain
with
the
two
tablets
in
my
hand
4
Then
he
wrote
on
the
tablets
the
words
he
had
written
before
the
Ten
Commandments
which
Jehovah
had
spoken
to
you
on
the
mountain
out
of
the
fire
on
the
day
of
the
assembly
and
Jehovah
gave
them
to
me
5
Then
I
turned
and
went
down
the
mountain
and
placed
the
tablets
in
the
ark
that
I
had
made
where
they
remain
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
me
6
The
Israelites
then
departed
from
Beeroth
Bene-jaakan
for
Moserah
There
Aaron
died
and
was
buried
and
his
son
Eleazar
began
to
serve
as
priest
in
his
place
7
From
there
they
departed
for
Gudgodah
and
from
Gudgodah
for
Jotbathah
a
land
flowing
with
streams
of
water
8
At
that
time
Jehovah
set
apart
the
tribe
of
Levi
to
carry
the
ark
of
Jehovahs
covenant
to
stand
before
Jehovah
in
order
to
minister
to
him
and
to
bless
in
his
name
as
they
do
to
this
day
9
That
is
why
Levi
has
no
share
or
inheritance
with
his
brothers
Jehovah
is
his
inheritance
just
as
Jehovah
your
God
had
said
to
him
10
I
myself
stayed
on
the
mountain
as
I
did
the
first
time
40
days
and
40
nights
and
Jehovah
listened
to
me
on
that
occasion
also
Jehovah
did
not
want
to
destroy
you
11
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
Go
ahead
of
the
people
and
prepare
to
depart
so
that
they
may
go
in
and
take
possession
of
the
land
that
I
have
sworn
to
their
forefathers
to
give
to
them
12
Now
O
Israel
what
is
Jehovah
your
God
asking
of
you
Only
this
to
fear
Jehovah
your
God
to
walk
in
all
his
ways
to
love
him
to
serve
Jehovah
your
God
with
all
your
heart
and
all
your
soul
13
and
to
keep
the
commandments
and
statutes
of
Jehovah
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
for
your
own
good
14
Look
to
Jehovah
your
God
belong
the
heavens
even
the
heavens
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
with
all
that
is
in
it
15
But
only
to
your
forefathers
did
Jehovah
draw
close
and
express
his
love
and
he
has
chosen
you
their
offspring
out
of
all
the
peoples
as
you
are
today
16
You
must
now
cleanse
your
hearts
and
stop
being
so
stubborn
17
For
Jehovah
your
God
is
the
God
of
gods
and
the
Lord
of
lords
the
God
great
mighty
and
awe-inspiring
who
treats
none
with
partiality
and
does
not
accept
a
bribe
18
He
executes
justice
for
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
and
loves
the
foreign
resident
giving
him
food
and
clothing
19
You
too
must
love
the
foreign
resident
for
you
became
foreign
residents
in
the
land
of
Egypt
20
Jehovah
your
God
you
should
fear
him
you
should
serve
to
him
you
should
cling
and
by
his
name
you
should
swear
21
He
is
the
One
you
are
to
praise
He
is
your
God
who
has
done
all
these
great
and
awe-inspiring
things
for
you
that
your
own
eyes
have
seen
22
With
70
people
your
forefathers
went
down
into
Egypt
and
now
Jehovah
your
God
has
made
you
as
numerous
as
the
stars
of
the
heavens
1
You
must
love
Jehovah
your
God
and
always
keep
your
obligation
to
him
and
his
statutes
his
judicial
decisions
and
his
commandments
2
You
know
that
today
I
am
addressing
you
not
your
sons
who
have
not
known
or
seen
the
discipline
of
Jehovah
your
God
his
greatness
his
mighty
hand
and
his
outstretched
arm
3
They
did
not
see
his
signs
and
his
deeds
that
he
did
in
Egypt
to
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
to
all
his
land
4
or
what
he
did
to
the
armies
of
Egypt
to
Pharaohs
horses
and
war
chariots
which
were
overwhelmed
by
the
waters
of
the
Red
Sea
when
they
were
chasing
after
you
and
Jehovah
destroyed
them
once
and
for
all
5
They
did
not
see
what
he
has
done
for
you
in
the
wilderness
until
your
coming
to
this
place
6
or
what
he
did
to
Dathan
and
Abiram
the
sons
of
Eliab
the
son
of
Reuben
when
the
earth
opened
and
swallowed
them
up
along
with
their
households
and
their
tents
and
every
living
thing
that
followed
them
before
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
7
Your
own
eyes
have
seen
all
the
great
deeds
that
Jehovah
did
8
You
must
keep
the
whole
commandment
that
I
am
giving
you
today
so
that
you
may
grow
strong
and
cross
over
into
the
land
to
take
possession
of
it
9
and
so
that
you
may
live
long
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
swore
to
give
to
your
forefathers
and
their
offspring
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
10
The
land
you
are
going
to
take
possession
of
is
not
like
the
land
of
Egypt
out
of
which
you
came
where
you
used
to
sow
your
seed
and
irrigate
it
with
your
foot
like
a
garden
of
vegetables
11
But
the
land
you
are
about
to
cross
into
and
possess
is
a
land
of
mountains
and
valley
plains
It
drinks
the
water
that
rains
from
the
heavens
12
it
is
a
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
caring
for
The
eyes
of
Jehovah
your
God
are
constantly
upon
it
from
the
beginning
of
the
year
to
the
close
of
the
year
13
And
if
you
will
diligently
obey
my
commandments
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
and
love
Jehovah
your
God
and
serve
him
with
all
your
heart
and
all
your
soul
14
I
will
also
give
rain
for
your
land
at
its
appointed
time
autumn
rain
and
spring
rain
and
you
will
gather
your
grain
and
your
new
wine
and
your
oil
15
And
I
will
provide
vegetation
in
your
fields
for
your
livestock
and
you
will
eat
and
be
satisfied
16
Be
careful
not
to
let
your
heart
be
enticed
to
go
astray
and
worship
other
gods
and
bow
down
to
them
17
Otherwise
Jehovahs
anger
will
blaze
against
you
and
he
will
shut
up
the
heavens
so
that
it
will
not
rain
and
the
ground
will
not
give
its
produce
and
you
will
quickly
perish
from
the
good
land
that
Jehovah
is
giving
you
18
You
must
impress
these
words
of
mine
on
your
heart
and
your
soul
and
bind
them
as
a
reminder
on
your
hand
and
they
should
be
like
a
headband
on
your
forehead
19
Teach
them
to
your
children
speaking
about
them
when
you
sit
in
your
house
and
when
you
walk
on
the
road
and
when
you
lie
down
and
when
you
get
up
20
Write
them
on
the
doorposts
of
your
house
and
on
your
gates
21
so
that
you
and
your
sons
may
live
long
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
swore
to
give
to
your
forefathers
for
as
long
as
the
heavens
are
over
the
earth
22
If
you
strictly
observe
this
commandment
that
I
am
giving
you
and
you
carry
it
out
to
love
Jehovah
your
God
to
walk
in
all
his
ways
and
to
cling
to
him
23
Jehovah
will
drive
away
all
these
nations
from
before
you
and
you
will
dispossess
nations
greater
and
more
numerous
than
you
are
24
Every
place
you
set
your
foot
will
become
yours
From
the
wilderness
up
to
Lebanon
from
the
River
the
river
Euphrates
to
the
western
sea
your
boundary
will
become
25
Nobody
will
stand
up
to
you
Jehovah
your
God
will
spread
the
dread
and
the
fear
of
you
over
the
whole
land
on
which
you
walk
just
as
he
promised
you
26
See
I
am
putting
before
you
today
a
blessing
and
a
curse
27
the
blessing
if
you
obey
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
your
God
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
28
and
the
curse
if
you
do
not
obey
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
you
turn
aside
from
the
way
I
am
commanding
you
to
follow
today
and
you
follow
gods
that
you
have
not
known
29
When
Jehovah
your
God
brings
you
into
the
land
you
are
to
possess
you
must
pronounce
the
blessing
on
Mount
Gerizim
and
the
curse
on
Mount
Ebal
30
Are
they
not
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
toward
the
west
in
the
land
of
the
Canaanites
who
live
in
the
Arabah
opposite
Gilgal
beside
the
big
trees
of
Moreh
31
For
you
are
crossing
the
Jordan
to
enter
and
take
possession
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
When
you
take
possession
of
it
and
live
in
it
32
you
must
be
careful
to
carry
out
all
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
I
am
putting
before
you
today
1
These
are
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
that
you
should
be
careful
to
carry
out
all
the
days
that
you
are
alive
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
will
give
you
to
possess
2
You
should
completely
destroy
all
the
places
where
the
nations
you
will
dispossess
have
served
their
gods
whether
on
the
high
mountains
or
on
the
hills
or
under
any
luxuriant
tree
3
You
should
pull
down
their
altars
shatter
their
sacred
pillars
burn
their
sacred
poles
in
the
fire
and
cut
down
the
graven
images
of
their
gods
obliterating
their
very
names
from
that
place
4
You
must
not
worship
Jehovah
your
God
in
that
way
5
Rather
seek
Jehovah
your
God
wherever
he
chooses
to
establish
his
name
and
his
place
of
residence
among
all
your
tribes
and
go
there
6
That
is
where
you
are
to
bring
your
burnt
offerings
your
sacrifices
your
tithes
the
contribution
from
your
hand
your
vow
offerings
your
voluntary
offerings
and
the
firstborn
of
your
herd
and
flock
7
You
and
your
households
must
eat
there
before
Jehovah
your
God
and
rejoice
in
all
your
undertakings
because
Jehovah
your
God
has
blessed
you
8
You
must
not
do
as
we
are
doing
here
today
with
everyone
doing
whatever
is
right
in
his
own
eyes
9
because
you
have
not
yet
come
into
the
resting-place
and
the
inheritance
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
10
When
you
do
cross
the
Jordan
and
dwell
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
to
possess
he
will
certainly
give
you
rest
from
all
your
enemies
around
you
and
you
will
dwell
in
security
11
You
will
bring
all
that
I
am
commanding
you
to
the
place
that
Jehovah
your
God
chooses
to
have
his
name
reside—your
burnt
offerings
your
sacrifices
your
tithes
the
contribution
from
your
hand
and
every
vow
offering
that
you
vow
to
Jehovah
12
You
will
rejoice
before
Jehovah
your
God
you
and
your
sons
your
daughters
your
male
and
female
slaves
and
the
Levite
inside
your
cities
for
he
has
no
share
or
inheritance
with
you
13
Be
careful
not
to
offer
up
your
burnt
offerings
in
any
other
place
you
may
see
14
You
should
offer
your
burnt
offerings
only
in
the
place
that
Jehovah
chooses
in
one
of
your
tribal
territories
and
there
you
should
do
everything
I
am
commanding
you
15
But
whenever
you
desire
it
you
may
slaughter
and
eat
meat
according
to
the
blessing
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
in
all
your
cities
The
unclean
person
and
the
clean
person
may
eat
it
as
you
would
eat
a
gazelle
or
a
deer
16
But
you
must
not
eat
the
blood
you
should
pour
it
out
on
the
ground
like
water
17
You
will
not
be
allowed
to
eat
within
your
cities
the
tenth
part
of
your
grain
your
new
wine
your
oil
the
firstborn
of
your
herd
and
flock
any
of
your
vow
offerings
that
you
vow
your
voluntary
offerings
or
the
contribution
from
your
hand
18
These
you
are
to
eat
before
Jehovah
your
God
in
the
place
Jehovah
your
God
will
choose—you
and
your
son
your
daughter
your
male
and
female
servant
and
the
Levite
inside
your
cities
and
you
will
rejoice
before
Jehovah
your
God
in
all
your
undertakings
19
Be
careful
not
to
neglect
the
Levite
as
long
as
you
live
in
your
land
20
When
Jehovah
your
God
enlarges
your
territory
just
as
he
has
promised
you
and
you
say
I
want
to
eat
meat

because
you
desire
to
eat
meat
you
may
eat
meat
whenever
you
desire
it
21
If
the
place
that
Jehovah
your
God
chooses
to
put
his
name
is
far
away
from
you
you
should
then
slaughter
some
of
your
herd
or
some
of
your
flock
that
Jehovah
has
given
you
just
as
I
have
commanded
you
and
you
should
eat
inside
your
cities
whenever
you
desire
it
22
You
may
eat
it
as
you
would
eat
the
gazelle
and
the
deer
both
the
unclean
person
and
the
clean
person
may
eat
it
23
Just
be
firmly
resolved
not
to
eat
the
blood
because
the
blood
is
the
life
and
you
must
not
eat
the
life
with
the
flesh
24
You
must
not
eat
it
You
should
pour
it
out
on
the
ground
like
water
25
You
must
not
eat
it
so
that
it
may
go
well
with
you
and
your
children
after
you
because
you
are
doing
what
is
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
26
You
should
take
only
the
holy
things
that
are
yours
and
your
vow
offerings
when
you
come
to
the
place
that
Jehovah
will
choose
27
There
you
will
offer
your
burnt
offerings
the
flesh
and
the
blood
on
the
altar
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
the
blood
of
your
sacrifices
should
be
poured
out
against
the
altar
of
Jehovah
your
God
but
the
flesh
you
may
eat
28
Be
careful
to
obey
all
these
words
that
I
am
commanding
you
so
that
it
may
always
go
well
with
you
and
your
sons
after
you
because
you
are
doing
what
is
good
and
right
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
your
God
29
When
Jehovah
your
God
annihilates
the
nations
that
you
are
to
dispossess
and
you
are
living
in
their
land
30
be
careful
not
to
be
entrapped
after
they
have
been
annihilated
from
before
you
Do
not
ask
about
their
gods
saying
How
were
these
nations
accustomed
to
serve
their
gods
I
too
will
do
the
same
31
You
must
not
do
this
to
Jehovah
your
God
because
they
do
for
their
gods
every
detestable
thing
that
Jehovah
hates
even
burning
their
sons
and
their
daughters
in
the
fire
to
their
gods
32
Every
word
that
I
am
commanding
you
is
what
you
should
be
careful
to
do
You
must
not
add
to
it
nor
take
away
from
it
1
In
case
a
prophet
or
one
who
foretells
by
dreams
arises
in
your
midst
and
gives
you
a
sign
or
a
portent
2
and
the
sign
or
the
portent
about
which
he
spoke
to
you
comes
true
while
he
is
saying
Let
us
walk
after
other
gods
gods
that
you
have
not
known
and
let
us
serve
them

3
you
must
not
listen
to
the
words
of
that
prophet
or
that
dreamer
for
Jehovah
your
God
is
testing
you
to
know
whether
you
love
Jehovah
your
God
with
all
your
heart
and
all
your
soul
4
After
Jehovah
your
God
you
should
walk
him
you
should
fear
his
commandments
you
should
keep
to
his
voice
you
should
listen
he
is
the
one
you
should
serve
and
to
him
you
should
hold
fast
5
But
that
prophet
or
that
dreamer
should
be
put
to
death
because
he
encouraged
rebellion
against
Jehovah
your
God—who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
and
redeemed
you
from
the
house
of
slavery—to
turn
you
from
the
way
in
which
Jehovah
your
God
has
commanded
you
to
walk
And
you
must
remove
what
is
evil
from
your
midst
6
If
your
brother
the
son
of
your
mother
or
your
son
or
your
daughter
or
your
cherished
wife
or
your
closest
companion
should
try
to
entice
you
in
secrecy
saying
Let
us
go
and
serve
other
gods

gods
that
neither
you
nor
your
forefathers
have
known
7
from
the
gods
of
the
peoples
all
around
you
whether
near
you
or
those
far
away
from
you
from
one
end
of
the
land
to
the
other
end
of
the
land
8
you
must
not
give
in
to
him
or
listen
to
him
nor
should
you
show
pity
or
feel
compassion
or
protect
him
9
instead
you
should
kill
him
without
fail
Your
hand
should
be
the
first
to
come
upon
him
to
put
him
to
death
and
the
hand
of
all
the
people
afterward
10
And
you
must
stone
him
to
death
because
he
has
sought
to
turn
you
away
from
Jehovah
your
God
who
has
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
out
of
the
house
of
slavery
11
Then
all
Israel
will
hear
and
become
afraid
and
they
will
never
again
do
anything
bad
like
this
among
you
12
In
case
you
hear
it
said
in
one
of
your
cities
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
to
occupy
13
Good-for-nothing
men
have
gone
out
among
you
to
turn
away
the
inhabitants
of
their
city
saying
Let
us
go
and
serve
other
gods

gods
that
you
have
not
known

14
you
should
look
into
the
matter
making
a
thorough
investigation
and
inquiry
and
if
it
is
confirmed
to
be
true
that
this
detestable
thing
has
been
done
among
you
15
you
should
without
fail
strike
down
the
inhabitants
of
that
city
with
the
sword
Devote
it
and
everything
that
is
in
it
including
its
livestock
to
destruction
by
the
sword
16
You
should
then
collect
all
its
spoil
into
the
middle
of
its
public
square
and
burn
the
city
with
fire
and
its
spoil
will
serve
as
a
whole
offering
to
Jehovah
your
God
It
will
become
a
permanent
heap
of
ruins
It
should
never
be
rebuilt
17
Your
hand
should
take
nothing
that
was
set
apart
for
destruction
so
that
Jehovah
may
turn
away
from
his
burning
anger
and
show
you
mercy
and
compassion
and
multiply
you
just
as
he
has
sworn
to
your
forefathers
18
For
you
should
obey
Jehovah
your
God
by
keeping
all
his
commandments
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
thus
doing
what
is
right
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
your
God
1
You
are
sons
of
Jehovah
your
God
Do
not
cut
yourselves
or
shave
your
foreheads
bald
for
a
dead
person
2
For
you
are
a
holy
people
to
Jehovah
your
God
and
Jehovah
has
chosen
you
to
become
his
people
his
special
property
out
of
all
the
peoples
who
are
on
the
face
of
the
earth
3
You
must
not
eat
anything
that
is
detestable
4
These
are
the
animals
that
you
may
eat
the
bull
the
sheep
the
goat
5
the
deer
the
gazelle
the
roebuck
the
wild
goat
the
antelope
the
wild
sheep
and
the
mountain
sheep
6
You
may
eat
any
animal
that
has
a
split
hoof
divided
into
two
and
that
chews
the
cud
7
However
you
must
not
eat
the
following
animals
that
chew
the
cud
or
that
have
split
hooves
the
camel
the
hare
and
the
rock
badger
because
they
chew
the
cud
but
do
not
have
split
hooves
They
are
unclean
for
you
8
Also
the
pig
because
it
has
a
split
hoof
but
does
not
chew
the
cud
It
is
unclean
for
you
You
must
not
eat
their
flesh
or
touch
their
carcasses
9
Of
everything
that
is
living
in
the
waters
you
may
eat
these
Anything
with
fins
and
scales
you
may
eat
10
But
you
must
not
eat
anything
that
has
no
fins
and
scales
It
is
unclean
for
you
11
You
may
eat
any
clean
bird
12
But
you
must
not
eat
these
the
eagle
the
osprey
the
black
vulture
13
the
red
kite
the
black
kite
every
kind
of
glede
14
every
kind
of
raven
15
the
ostrich
the
owl
the
gull
every
kind
of
falcon
16
the
little
owl
the
long-eared
owl
the
swan
17
the
pelican
the
vulture
the
cormorant
18
the
stork
every
kind
of
heron
the
hoopoe
and
the
bat
19
Every
winged
swarming
creature
also
is
unclean
for
you
They
should
not
be
eaten
20
Any
clean
flying
creature
you
may
eat
21
You
must
not
eat
any
animal
that
was
found
dead
You
may
give
it
to
the
foreign
resident
who
is
inside
your
cities
and
he
may
eat
it
or
it
may
be
sold
to
a
foreigner
For
you
are
a
holy
people
to
Jehovah
your
God
You
must
not
boil
a
young
goat
in
its
mothers
milk
22
You
must
without
fail
give
a
tenth
of
everything
your
seed
produces
in
the
field
year
by
year
23
You
will
eat
the
tenth
part
of
your
grain
your
new
wine
your
oil
and
the
firstborn
of
your
herd
and
your
flock
before
Jehovah
your
God
in
the
place
that
he
chooses
to
have
his
name
reside
so
that
you
may
learn
to
fear
Jehovah
your
God
always
24
But
if
the
journey
should
be
too
long
for
you
and
you
are
not
able
to
carry
it
to
the
place
that
Jehovah
your
God
chooses
as
the
place
for
his
name
because
it
is
far
away
from
you
because
Jehovah
your
God
will
bless
you
25
you
may
then
convert
it
into
money
and
with
your
money
in
hand
travel
to
the
place
that
Jehovah
your
God
will
choose
26
You
may
then
spend
the
money
on
whatever
you
desire—cattle
sheep
goats
wine
and
other
alcoholic
beverages
and
anything
you
please
and
you
will
eat
there
before
Jehovah
your
God
and
rejoice
you
and
your
household
27
And
do
not
neglect
the
Levite
who
is
inside
your
cities
for
he
has
no
share
or
inheritance
with
you
28
At
the
end
of
every
three
years
you
should
bring
out
the
entire
tenth
part
of
your
produce
for
that
year
and
deposit
it
inside
your
cities
29
Then
the
Levite
who
has
no
share
or
inheritance
with
you
the
foreign
resident
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
who
are
in
your
cities
will
come
and
eat
their
fill
so
that
Jehovah
your
God
may
bless
you
in
all
that
you
do
1
At
the
end
of
every
seven
years
you
should
grant
a
release
2
This
is
the
nature
of
the
release
Every
creditor
will
release
his
neighbor
from
the
debt
he
incurred
He
should
not
demand
payment
from
his
neighbor
or
his
brother
for
it
will
be
proclaimed
a
release
to
Jehovah
3
You
may
demand
payment
from
the
foreigner
but
you
should
release
your
claim
on
whatever
your
brother
owes
you
4
However
no
one
among
you
should
become
poor
for
Jehovah
will
surely
bless
you
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
to
possess
as
an
inheritance
5
but
only
if
you
strictly
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
carefully
observe
all
this
commandment
that
I
am
giving
you
today
6
For
Jehovah
your
God
will
bless
you
just
as
he
has
promised
you
and
you
will
lend
to
many
nations
but
you
will
not
need
to
borrow
and
you
will
dominate
many
nations
but
they
will
not
dominate
you
7
If
one
of
your
brothers
becomes
poor
among
you
in
one
of
your
cities
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
do
not
harden
your
heart
or
be
tightfisted
toward
your
poor
brother
8
For
you
should
generously
open
your
hand
to
him
and
by
all
means
lend
whatever
he
needs
or
is
lacking
9
Be
careful
not
to
harbor
this
evil
idea
in
your
heart
The
seventh
year
the
year
of
the
release
has
approached

and
hold
back
your
generosity
toward
your
poor
brother
and
give
him
nothing
If
he
calls
out
to
Jehovah
against
you
it
will
be
a
sin
on
your
part
10
You
should
generously
give
to
him
and
you
should
not
give
to
him
grudgingly
for
this
is
why
Jehovah
your
God
will
bless
your
every
deed
and
undertaking
11
For
there
will
always
be
poor
people
in
the
land
That
is
why
I
am
commanding
you
You
should
generously
open
up
your
hand
to
your
afflicted
and
poor
brother
in
your
land
12
If
one
of
your
brothers
a
Hebrew
man
or
woman
is
sold
to
you
and
has
served
you
for
six
years
then
in
the
seventh
year
you
should
set
him
free
13
And
if
you
should
set
him
free
do
not
send
him
away
empty-handed
14
You
should
supply
him
generously
with
something
from
your
flock
your
threshing
floor
and
your
press
for
oil
and
wine
Just
as
Jehovah
your
God
has
blessed
you
you
should
give
to
him
15
Remember
that
you
became
a
slave
in
the
land
of
Egypt
and
that
Jehovah
your
God
redeemed
you
That
is
why
I
am
commanding
you
to
do
this
today
16
But
if
he
says
to
you
I
will
not
go
out
from
your
company
because
he
loves
you
and
your
household
since
he
has
been
happy
while
with
you
17
you
should
then
take
an
awl
and
put
it
through
his
ear
into
the
door
and
he
will
become
your
slave
for
life
You
should
do
the
same
with
your
slave
girl
18
Do
not
consider
it
a
hardship
when
you
set
him
free
and
he
leaves
you
because
his
service
to
you
for
six
years
was
worth
twice
as
much
as
that
of
a
hired
worker
and
Jehovah
your
God
has
blessed
you
in
everything
that
was
done
19
You
should
sanctify
every
firstborn
male
of
your
herd
and
your
flock
to
Jehovah
your
God
You
must
not
do
any
work
with
the
firstborn
of
your
herd
nor
shear
the
firstborn
of
your
flock
20
You
and
your
household
should
eat
it
before
Jehovah
your
God
year
by
year
in
the
place
that
Jehovah
will
choose
21
But
if
it
has
a
defect—lameness
blindness
or
any
other
serious
defect—you
must
not
sacrifice
it
to
Jehovah
your
God
22
You
should
eat
it
inside
your
cities
the
unclean
and
clean
person
together
as
though
it
were
a
gazelle
or
a
deer
23
But
you
must
not
eat
its
blood
you
should
pour
it
out
on
the
ground
like
water
1
Observe
the
month
of
Abib
and
celebrate
the
Passover
to
Jehovah
your
God
for
in
the
month
of
Abib
Jehovah
your
God
brought
you
out
of
Egypt
by
night
2
And
you
should
sacrifice
the
Passover
offering
to
Jehovah
your
God
from
the
flock
and
the
herd
in
the
place
that
Jehovah
chooses
to
have
his
name
reside
3
You
must
not
eat
anything
leavened
along
with
it
for
seven
days
you
should
eat
unleavened
bread
the
bread
of
affliction
because
you
came
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
in
haste
Do
this
so
that
you
may
remember
the
day
you
came
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
as
long
as
you
live
4
No
sourdough
should
be
found
with
you
in
all
your
territory
for
seven
days
nor
should
any
of
the
meat
that
you
will
sacrifice
in
the
evening
on
the
first
day
remain
all
night
until
the
next
morning
5
You
will
not
be
allowed
to
sacrifice
the
Passover
offering
in
just
any
of
the
cities
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
6
But
it
should
be
done
at
the
place
that
Jehovah
your
God
chooses
to
have
his
name
reside
You
should
sacrifice
the
Passover
offering
in
the
evening
as
soon
as
the
sun
sets
at
the
appointed
time
of
your
coming
out
of
Egypt
7
You
must
cook
it
and
eat
it
in
the
place
that
Jehovah
your
God
will
choose
and
in
the
morning
you
may
return
to
your
own
tents
8
Six
days
you
should
eat
unleavened
bread
and
on
the
seventh
day
there
will
be
a
solemn
assembly
to
Jehovah
your
God
You
must
do
no
work
9
You
should
count
off
seven
weeks
You
should
begin
counting
off
seven
weeks
from
the
time
you
first
put
the
sickle
to
the
standing
grain
10
Then
you
are
to
celebrate
the
Festival
of
Weeks
to
Jehovah
your
God
with
the
voluntary
offering
from
your
hand
given
in
proportion
to
how
Jehovah
your
God
blesses
you
11
And
you
are
to
rejoice
before
Jehovah
your
God
you
and
your
son
your
daughter
your
male
slave
your
female
slave
the
Levite
who
is
inside
your
cities
the
foreign
resident
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
who
are
in
your
midst
in
the
place
that
Jehovah
your
God
chooses
to
have
his
name
reside
12
Remember
that
you
became
a
slave
in
Egypt
and
observe
and
carry
out
these
regulations
13
You
should
celebrate
the
Festival
of
Booths
for
seven
days
when
you
make
an
ingathering
from
your
threshing
floor
and
from
your
press
for
oil
and
wine
14
Rejoice
during
your
festival
you
and
your
son
your
daughter
your
male
slave
your
female
slave
the
Levite
the
foreign
resident
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
who
are
inside
your
cities
15
Seven
days
you
will
celebrate
the
festival
to
Jehovah
your
God
in
the
place
that
Jehovah
chooses
for
Jehovah
your
God
will
bless
all
your
produce
and
all
that
you
do
and
you
will
become
nothing
but
joyful
16
Three
times
a
year
all
your
males
should
appear
before
Jehovah
your
God
in
the
place
that
he
chooses
at
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
the
Festival
of
Weeks
and
the
Festival
of
Booths
and
none
of
them
should
appear
before
Jehovah
empty-handed
17
The
gift
that
each
one
brings
should
be
in
proportion
to
the
blessing
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
18
You
should
appoint
judges
and
officers
for
each
tribe
in
all
the
cities
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
and
they
must
judge
the
people
with
righteous
judgment
19
You
must
not
pervert
justice
show
partiality
or
accept
a
bribe
for
the
bribe
blinds
the
eyes
of
the
wise
and
distorts
the
words
of
the
righteous
20
Justice—justice
you
should
pursue
so
that
you
may
keep
living
and
take
possession
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
21
You
should
not
plant
any
sort
of
tree
as
a
sacred
pole
near
the
altar
of
Jehovah
your
God
that
you
make
for
yourself
22
Neither
should
you
set
up
a
sacred
pillar
for
yourself
something
Jehovah
your
God
hates
1
You
must
not
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
your
God
a
bull
or
a
sheep
that
has
a
defect
or
anything
wrong
with
it
for
it
would
be
detestable
to
Jehovah
your
God
2
Suppose
a
man
or
a
woman
is
found
among
you
in
any
of
your
cities
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
who
is
practicing
what
is
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
violating
his
covenant
3
and
he
goes
astray
and
worships
other
gods
and
he
bows
down
to
them
or
to
the
sun
or
the
moon
or
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
a
thing
that
I
have
not
commanded
4
When
it
is
reported
to
you
or
you
hear
about
it
then
you
should
investigate
the
matter
thoroughly
If
it
is
confirmed
to
be
true
that
this
detestable
thing
has
been
done
in
Israel
5
you
must
bring
the
man
or
the
woman
who
has
done
this
evil
thing
out
to
the
city
gates
and
the
man
or
the
woman
must
be
stoned
to
death
6
On
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses
or
of
three
witnesses
the
one
who
is
to
die
should
be
put
to
death
He
must
not
be
put
to
death
on
the
testimony
of
one
witness
7
The
hand
of
the
witnesses
should
be
the
first
to
come
against
him
to
put
him
to
death
and
the
hand
of
all
the
people
afterward
You
must
remove
what
is
bad
from
your
midst
8
If
a
case
arises
in
one
of
your
cities
that
is
too
difficult
for
you
to
judge
whether
it
is
a
case
involving
bloodshed
or
a
legal
claim
that
has
been
raised
or
a
violent
deed
that
has
been
committed
or
other
matters
of
dispute
you
should
rise
up
and
go
to
the
place
that
Jehovah
your
God
chooses
9
Go
to
the
Levitical
priests
and
to
the
judge
serving
in
those
days
and
make
your
inquiry
and
they
will
hand
down
the
decision
to
you
10
Then
you
must
act
according
to
the
decision
that
they
hand
down
to
you
from
the
place
that
Jehovah
chooses
Be
careful
to
do
according
to
all
that
they
instruct
you
11
You
must
act
according
to
the
law
that
they
show
you
and
according
to
the
decision
that
they
declare
to
you
Do
not
deviate
from
the
decision
that
they
will
hand
down
to
you
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
12
The
man
who
acts
presumptuously
by
not
listening
to
the
priest
who
is
ministering
to
Jehovah
your
God
or
to
the
judge
must
die
You
must
remove
what
is
bad
from
Israel
13
All
the
people
will
then
hear
and
become
afraid
and
they
will
not
act
presumptuously
anymore
14
When
you
enter
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
and
you
have
taken
possession
of
it
and
are
living
in
it
and
you
say
Let
me
appoint
a
king
over
myself
like
all
the
nations
around
me

15
in
that
case
you
should
without
fail
appoint
a
king
whom
Jehovah
your
God
chooses
You
should
appoint
a
king
from
among
your
brothers
You
are
forbidden
to
appoint
over
yourself
a
foreigner
who
is
not
your
brother
16
However
he
should
not
acquire
many
horses
for
himself
or
make
the
people
go
back
to
Egypt
in
order
to
obtain
more
horses
since
Jehovah
told
you
You
must
never
go
back
again
by
this
way
17
Neither
should
he
take
many
wives
for
himself
so
that
his
heart
may
not
go
astray
nor
should
he
acquire
vast
amounts
of
silver
and
gold
for
himself
18
When
he
takes
his
seat
on
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
he
must
write
for
himself
in
a
book
a
copy
of
this
Law
taken
from
the
one
kept
by
the
Levitical
priests
19
It
is
to
remain
with
him
and
he
must
read
from
it
all
the
days
of
his
life
so
that
he
may
learn
to
fear
Jehovah
his
God
and
observe
all
the
words
of
this
Law
and
these
regulations
by
carrying
them
out
20
Thus
his
heart
will
not
exalt
itself
above
his
brothers
and
he
will
not
deviate
from
the
commandment
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
so
that
he
may
remain
a
long
time
over
his
kingdom
he
and
his
sons
in
the
midst
of
Israel
1
The
Levitical
priests
and
indeed
the
entire
tribe
of
Levi
will
have
no
share
or
inheritance
with
Israel
They
will
eat
of
the
offerings
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
which
are
his
inheritance
2
So
they
should
have
no
inheritance
in
the
midst
of
their
brothers
Jehovah
is
their
inheritance
just
as
he
has
spoken
to
them
3
Now
this
will
be
the
due
right
of
the
priests
from
the
people
Whoever
makes
a
sacrifice
whether
a
bull
or
a
sheep
is
to
give
the
shoulder
the
jaws
and
the
stomach
to
the
priest
4
The
firstfruits
of
your
grain
your
new
wine
your
oil
and
the
first
wool
that
is
shorn
from
your
flock
you
should
give
him
5
Jehovah
your
God
has
chosen
him
and
his
sons
from
all
your
tribes
to
minister
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
always
6
But
if
a
Levite
leaves
one
of
your
cities
in
Israel
where
he
was
living
and
he
desires
to
go
to
the
place
that
Jehovah
chooses
7
he
may
minister
there
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
his
God
the
same
as
all
his
brothers
the
Levites
who
are
stationed
there
before
Jehovah
8
He
will
receive
an
equal
share
of
food
with
them
in
addition
to
what
he
receives
from
selling
his
ancestral
possessions
9
When
you
have
entered
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
you
must
not
learn
to
imitate
the
detestable
practices
of
those
nations
10
There
should
not
be
found
in
you
anyone
who
makes
his
son
or
his
daughter
pass
through
the
fire
anyone
who
employs
divination
anyone
practicing
magic
anyone
who
looks
for
omens
a
sorcerer
11
anyone
binding
others
with
a
spell
anyone
who
consults
a
spirit
medium
or
a
fortune-teller
or
anyone
who
inquires
of
the
dead
12
For
whoever
does
these
things
is
detestable
to
Jehovah
and
on
account
of
these
detestable
practices
Jehovah
your
God
is
driving
them
away
from
before
you
13
You
should
prove
yourself
blameless
before
Jehovah
your
God
14
For
these
nations
that
you
are
dispossessing
used
to
listen
to
those
practicing
magic
and
divination
but
Jehovah
your
God
has
not
allowed
you
to
do
anything
like
this
15
Jehovah
your
God
will
raise
up
for
you
from
among
your
brothers
a
prophet
like
me
You
must
listen
to
him
16
This
is
in
response
to
what
you
asked
of
Jehovah
your
God
in
Horeb
on
the
day
of
the
assembly
when
you
said
Do
not
let
me
hear
the
voice
of
Jehovah
my
God
or
see
this
great
fire
anymore
so
that
I
do
not
die
17
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
What
they
have
said
is
good
18
I
will
raise
up
for
them
from
the
midst
of
their
brothers
a
prophet
like
you
and
I
will
put
my
words
in
his
mouth
and
he
will
speak
to
them
all
that
I
command
him
19
Indeed
I
will
require
an
account
from
the
man
who
will
not
listen
to
my
words
that
he
will
speak
in
my
name
20
If
any
prophet
presumptuously
speaks
a
word
in
my
name
that
I
did
not
command
him
to
speak
or
speaks
in
the
name
of
other
gods
that
prophet
must
die
21
However
you
may
say
in
your
heart
How
will
we
know
that
Jehovah
has
not
spoken
the
word
22
When
the
prophet
speaks
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
and
the
word
is
not
fulfilled
or
does
not
come
true
then
Jehovah
did
not
speak
that
word
The
prophet
spoke
it
presumptuously
You
should
not
fear
him
1
When
Jehovah
your
God
destroys
the
nations
whose
land
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
and
you
have
dispossessed
them
and
have
settled
in
their
cities
and
their
houses
2
you
should
set
apart
three
cities
in
the
midst
of
your
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
to
possess
3
You
should
divide
the
territory
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
to
possess
into
three
parts
and
prepare
the
roads
so
that
any
manslayer
can
flee
to
one
of
those
cities
4
Now
this
is
what
should
take
place
regarding
the
manslayer
who
may
flee
there
in
order
to
live
When
he
strikes
his
fellow
man
unintentionally
and
he
did
not
previously
hate
him
5
as
when
he
goes
with
his
fellow
man
into
the
forest
to
gather
wood
and
he
raises
his
hand
to
cut
the
tree
with
the
ax
but
the
axhead
flies
off
the
handle
and
hits
his
fellow
man
and
he
dies
the
manslayer
should
flee
to
one
of
these
cities
to
live
6
Otherwise
in
the
heat
of
anger
the
avenger
of
blood
may
chase
after
the
manslayer
overtake
him
and
kill
him
because
the
distance
to
the
city
was
too
far
However
he
did
not
deserve
to
die
since
he
did
not
previously
hate
his
fellow
man
7
That
is
why
I
am
commanding
you
Set
three
cities
apart
8
If
Jehovah
your
God
enlarges
your
territory
as
he
swore
to
your
forefathers
and
he
has
given
you
all
the
land
that
he
promised
to
give
to
your
forefathers
9
—provided
you
faithfully
observe
all
this
commandment
that
I
am
giving
you
today
to
love
Jehovah
your
God
and
always
to
walk
in
his
ways—then
you
are
to
add
three
other
cities
to
these
three
10
In
this
way
no
innocent
blood
will
be
spilled
in
your
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
as
an
inheritance
and
no
bloodguilt
will
come
upon
you
11
But
if
a
man
hated
his
fellow
man
and
he
was
waiting
to
attack
him
and
he
fatally
wounded
him
and
he
died
and
the
man
has
fled
to
one
of
these
cities
12
the
elders
of
his
city
should
then
summon
him
from
there
and
deliver
him
into
the
hand
of
the
avenger
of
blood
and
he
must
die
13
You
should
not
feel
sorry
for
him
and
you
must
remove
the
guilt
of
innocent
blood
out
of
Israel
so
that
it
may
go
well
for
you
14
When
you
receive
your
inheritance
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
to
possess
you
must
not
move
your
neighbors
boundary
marker
from
the
place
where
the
ancestors
set
the
boundaries
15
No
single
witness
may
convict
another
for
any
error
or
any
sin
that
he
may
commit
On
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses
or
on
the
testimony
of
three
witnesses
the
matter
should
be
established
16
If
a
malicious
witness
testifies
against
a
man
and
charges
him
with
some
transgression
17
the
two
men
who
have
the
dispute
will
stand
before
Jehovah
before
the
priests
and
the
judges
who
will
be
serving
in
those
days
18
The
judges
will
thoroughly
investigate
and
if
the
man
who
testified
is
a
false
witness
and
has
brought
a
false
charge
against
his
brother
19
you
should
do
to
him
just
as
he
had
schemed
to
do
to
his
brother
and
you
must
remove
what
is
bad
from
your
midst
20
Those
who
remain
will
hear
and
be
afraid
and
they
will
never
again
do
anything
bad
like
this
among
you
21
You
should
not
feel
sorry
Life
will
be
for
life
eye
for
eye
tooth
for
tooth
hand
for
hand
foot
for
foot
1
If
you
go
to
war
against
your
enemies
and
you
see
their
horses
and
chariots
and
troops
that
outnumber
yours
do
not
be
afraid
of
them
for
Jehovah
your
God
who
brought
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
is
with
you
2
When
you
are
about
to
go
into
battle
the
priest
should
approach
and
address
the
people
3
He
should
tell
them
Hear
O
Israel
you
are
about
to
do
battle
with
your
enemies
Do
not
be
fainthearted
Do
not
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
or
tremble
because
of
them
4
for
Jehovah
your
God
is
marching
with
you
to
fight
for
you
against
your
enemies
and
to
save
you
5
The
officers
too
should
tell
the
people
Who
has
built
a
new
house
and
has
not
inaugurated
it
Let
him
return
to
his
house
Otherwise
he
may
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
will
inaugurate
it
6
And
who
has
planted
a
vineyard
and
not
begun
to
use
it
Let
him
go
and
return
to
his
house
Otherwise
he
may
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
will
begin
to
use
it
7
And
who
has
become
engaged
to
a
woman
and
has
not
married
her
Let
him
go
and
return
to
his
house
Otherwise
he
might
die
in
the
battle
and
another
man
will
marry
her
8
The
officers
should
also
ask
the
people
Who
is
fearful
and
fainthearted
He
should
return
to
his
house
so
that
he
may
not
cause
his
brothers
to
lose
heart
as
he
has
9
When
the
officers
have
finished
speaking
to
the
people
they
should
appoint
chiefs
of
the
armies
to
lead
the
people
10
If
you
approach
a
city
to
fight
against
it
you
should
also
announce
to
it
terms
of
peace
11
If
it
gives
a
peaceful
answer
to
you
and
opens
up
to
you
all
the
people
found
there
will
become
yours
for
forced
labor
and
they
will
serve
you
12
But
if
it
refuses
to
make
peace
with
you
and
instead
goes
to
war
with
you
you
should
besiege
it
13
and
Jehovah
your
God
will
certainly
give
it
into
your
hand
and
you
must
strike
down
every
male
in
it
with
the
sword
14
However
the
women
the
children
the
livestock
and
everything
that
is
in
the
city
all
its
spoil
you
may
plunder
for
yourself
and
you
will
eat
the
spoil
of
your
enemies
which
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
to
you
15
That
is
what
you
will
do
to
all
the
cities
very
far
away
from
you
that
are
not
of
the
cities
of
these
nearby
nations
16
But
in
the
cities
of
these
peoples
which
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
as
an
inheritance
you
must
not
allow
any
breathing
thing
to
live
17
Instead
you
should
devote
them
completely
to
destruction
the
Hittites
the
Amorites
the
Canaanites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
just
as
Jehovah
your
God
has
commanded
you
18
so
that
they
may
not
teach
you
to
follow
all
their
detestable
practices
that
they
have
done
for
their
gods
causing
you
to
sin
against
Jehovah
your
God
19
If
you
lay
siege
to
a
city
and
capture
it
after
fighting
against
it
for
many
days
you
should
not
destroy
its
trees
by
wielding
an
ax
against
them
You
may
eat
from
them
but
you
should
not
cut
them
down
For
should
you
besiege
a
tree
of
the
field
as
you
would
a
man
20
You
may
destroy
only
a
tree
that
you
know
is
not
used
for
food
You
may
cut
it
down
and
build
siegeworks
against
the
city
that
is
making
war
against
you
until
it
falls
1
If
someone
is
found
slain
in
a
field
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
to
possess
and
it
is
not
known
who
killed
him
2
your
elders
and
judges
should
go
out
and
measure
the
distance
from
the
dead
body
to
the
cities
that
surround
it
3
Then
the
elders
of
the
city
nearest
to
the
body
should
take
from
the
herd
a
young
cow
that
has
never
been
put
to
work
that
has
never
pulled
in
a
yoke
4
and
the
elders
of
that
city
should
lead
the
young
cow
down
to
a
valley
running
with
water
where
no
tilling
or
sowing
of
seed
has
been
done
and
they
should
break
the
neck
of
the
young
cow
there
in
the
valley
5
And
the
priests
the
Levites
will
approach
because
Jehovah
your
God
has
chosen
them
to
minister
to
him
to
pronounce
blessings
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
They
will
declare
how
every
dispute
involving
violence
should
be
resolved
6
Then
all
the
elders
of
the
city
who
are
nearest
to
the
dead
body
should
wash
their
hands
over
the
young
cow
whose
neck
was
broken
in
the
valley
7
and
they
should
declare
Our
hands
did
not
shed
this
blood
nor
did
our
eyes
see
it
shed
8
Do
not
hold
this
against
your
people
Israel
whom
you
redeemed
O
Jehovah
and
do
not
let
guilt
for
innocent
blood
remain
among
your
people
Israel
Then
the
bloodguilt
will
not
be
held
against
them
9
In
this
way
you
will
remove
the
guilt
of
innocent
blood
from
your
midst
by
doing
what
is
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
10
If
you
go
to
war
against
your
enemies
and
Jehovah
your
God
defeats
them
for
you
and
you
take
them
captive
11
and
you
see
among
the
captives
a
beautiful
woman
and
you
are
attracted
to
her
and
you
want
to
take
her
as
your
wife
12
you
may
bring
her
into
your
house
She
should
then
shave
her
head
attend
to
her
nails
13
and
remove
the
clothing
of
her
captivity
and
dwell
in
your
house
She
will
weep
for
her
father
and
her
mother
a
whole
month
and
afterward
you
may
have
relations
with
her
you
will
become
her
husband
and
she
will
become
your
wife
14
But
if
you
are
not
pleased
with
her
you
should
then
let
her
go
wherever
she
wishes
But
you
may
not
sell
her
for
money
or
treat
her
harshly
since
you
have
humiliated
her
15
If
a
man
has
two
wives
and
he
loves
one
more
than
the
other
and
both
have
borne
sons
to
him
and
the
firstborn
son
belongs
to
the
unloved
one
16
on
the
day
that
he
gives
his
inheritance
to
his
sons
he
will
not
be
allowed
to
treat
the
son
of
the
loved
one
as
his
firstborn
at
the
expense
of
the
son
of
the
unloved
one
the
firstborn
17
He
should
recognize
as
the
firstborn
the
unloved
ones
son
by
giving
him
the
double
portion
of
everything
he
has
for
that
one
is
the
beginning
of
his
procreative
power
The
right
of
the
firstborns
position
belongs
to
him
18
If
a
man
has
a
son
who
is
stubborn
and
rebellious
and
he
does
not
obey
his
father
or
his
mother
and
they
have
tried
to
correct
him
but
he
refuses
to
listen
to
them
19
his
father
and
his
mother
should
take
hold
of
him
and
bring
him
out
to
the
elders
at
the
gate
of
his
city
20
and
say
to
the
elders
of
his
city
This
son
of
ours
is
stubborn
and
rebellious
and
he
refuses
to
obey
us
He
is
a
glutton
and
a
drunkard
21
Then
all
the
men
of
his
city
must
stone
him
to
death
So
you
must
remove
what
is
bad
from
your
midst
and
all
Israel
will
hear
and
become
afraid
22
If
a
man
commits
a
sin
deserving
the
sentence
of
death
and
he
has
been
put
to
death
and
you
have
hung
him
on
a
stake
23
his
dead
body
should
not
remain
all
night
on
the
stake
Instead
you
should
be
sure
to
bury
him
on
that
day
because
the
one
hung
up
is
something
accursed
of
God
and
you
should
not
defile
your
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
as
an
inheritance
1
If
you
see
your
brothers
bull
or
his
sheep
going
astray
do
not
deliberately
ignore
it
You
should
without
fail
lead
it
back
to
your
brother
2
But
if
your
brother
does
not
live
near
you
or
you
do
not
know
him
you
should
bring
the
animal
to
your
house
and
it
will
remain
with
you
until
your
brother
searches
for
it
Then
you
should
return
it
to
him
3
That
is
what
you
should
do
with
his
donkey
with
his
clothing
and
with
anything
that
your
brother
has
lost
and
you
have
found
You
must
not
ignore
it
4
If
you
see
your
brothers
donkey
or
his
bull
fall
down
on
the
road
you
must
not
deliberately
ignore
it
You
should
without
fail
help
him
raise
the
animal
up
5
A
woman
must
not
put
on
the
clothing
of
a
man
nor
should
a
man
wear
the
clothing
of
a
woman
For
anyone
doing
so
is
detestable
to
Jehovah
your
God
6
If
you
happen
upon
a
birds
nest
along
the
road
with
young
ones
or
eggs
whether
in
a
tree
or
on
the
ground
and
the
mother
is
sitting
on
the
young
ones
or
the
eggs
you
must
not
take
the
mother
together
with
her
young
7
Be
sure
to
send
the
mother
away
but
you
may
take
the
young
for
yourself
Do
this
so
that
it
may
go
well
with
you
and
you
may
live
long
8
If
you
build
a
new
house
you
must
also
make
a
parapet
for
your
roof
so
that
you
may
not
bring
bloodguilt
on
your
house
because
of
someone
falling
from
it
9
You
must
not
sow
your
vineyard
with
two
sorts
of
seed
Otherwise
everything
produced
from
the
seed
you
sow
as
well
as
the
product
of
the
vineyard
will
be
forfeited
to
the
sanctuary
10
You
must
not
plow
with
a
bull
and
a
donkey
together
11
You
must
not
wear
clothing
made
of
wool
and
linen
mixed
together
12
You
should
make
tassels
on
the
four
corners
of
the
clothing
you
wear
13
If
a
man
takes
a
wife
and
has
relations
with
her
but
then
comes
to
hate
her
14
and
he
accuses
her
of
misconduct
and
gives
her
a
bad
name
by
saying
I
have
taken
this
woman
but
when
I
had
relations
with
her
I
did
not
find
evidence
that
she
was
a
virgin

15
the
father
and
mother
of
the
girl
should
produce
the
evidence
of
the
girls
virginity
for
the
elders
at
the
gate
of
the
city
16
The
girls
father
must
say
to
the
elders
I
gave
my
daughter
to
this
man
as
a
wife
but
he
hates
her
17
and
is
accusing
her
of
misconduct
by
saying
I
have
found
out
that
your
daughter
does
not
have
evidence
of
virginity
Now
this
is
the
evidence
of
my
daughters
virginity
They
will
then
spread
out
the
cloth
before
the
elders
of
the
city
18
The
city
elders
will
take
the
man
and
discipline
him
19
They
will
fine
him
100
silver
shekels
and
give
them
to
the
girls
father
because
the
man
defamed
a
virgin
of
Israel
and
she
will
continue
to
be
his
wife
He
will
not
be
allowed
to
divorce
her
as
long
as
he
lives
20
If
though
the
accusation
is
true
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
girl
was
a
virgin
21
they
should
bring
the
girl
out
to
the
entrance
of
her
fathers
house
and
the
men
of
her
city
should
stone
her
to
death
because
she
has
committed
a
disgraceful
act
in
Israel
by
committing
sexual
immorality
in
the
house
of
her
father
So
you
must
remove
what
is
bad
from
your
midst
22
If
a
man
is
found
lying
down
with
a
woman
who
is
the
wife
of
another
man
both
of
them
must
die
together
the
man
who
lay
down
with
the
woman
as
well
as
the
woman
So
you
must
remove
what
is
bad
out
of
Israel
23
If
a
virgin
is
engaged
to
a
man
and
another
man
happens
to
meet
her
in
the
city
and
lies
down
with
her
24
you
should
bring
them
both
out
to
the
gate
of
that
city
and
stone
them
to
death
the
girl
because
she
did
not
scream
in
the
city
and
the
man
because
he
humiliated
the
wife
of
his
fellow
man
So
you
must
remove
what
is
evil
from
your
midst
25
If
however
the
man
happened
to
meet
the
engaged
girl
in
the
field
and
the
man
overpowered
her
and
lay
down
with
her
the
man
who
lay
down
with
her
is
to
die
by
himself
26
and
you
must
do
nothing
to
the
girl
The
girl
has
not
committed
a
sin
deserving
of
death
This
case
is
the
same
as
when
a
man
attacks
his
fellow
man
and
murders
him
27
For
he
happened
to
meet
her
in
the
field
and
the
engaged
girl
screamed
but
there
was
no
one
to
rescue
her
28
If
a
man
happens
to
meet
a
virgin
girl
who
is
not
engaged
and
he
seizes
her
and
lies
down
with
her
and
they
are
discovered
29
the
man
who
lay
down
with
her
must
give
the
girls
father
50
silver
shekels
and
she
will
become
his
wife
Because
he
humiliated
her
he
will
not
be
allowed
to
divorce
her
as
long
as
he
lives
30
No
man
should
take
his
fathers
wife
so
that
he
may
not
dishonor
his
father
1
No
man
who
has
been
castrated
by
having
his
testicles
crushed
or
who
has
had
his
male
organ
cut
off
may
come
into
the
congregation
of
Jehovah
2
No
illegitimate
son
may
come
into
the
congregation
of
Jehovah
Even
to
the
tenth
generation
none
of
his
descendants
may
come
into
the
congregation
of
Jehovah
3
No
Ammonite
or
Moabite
may
come
into
the
congregation
of
Jehovah
Even
to
the
tenth
generation
none
of
their
descendants
may
ever
come
into
the
congregation
of
Jehovah
4
because
they
did
not
come
to
your
aid
with
food
and
water
when
you
were
on
the
way
going
out
of
Egypt
and
because
they
hired
against
you
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
from
Pethor
of
Mesopotamia
to
curse
you
5
But
Jehovah
your
God
refused
to
listen
to
Balaam
Rather
Jehovah
your
God
changed
the
curse
into
a
blessing
for
you
because
Jehovah
your
God
loved
you
6
You
should
never
seek
their
welfare
or
their
prosperity
all
your
days
7
You
must
not
hate
an
Edomite
for
he
is
your
brother
You
must
not
hate
an
Egyptian
for
you
became
a
foreign
resident
in
his
country
8
The
third
generation
of
children
born
to
them
may
enter
the
congregation
of
Jehovah
9
When
you
are
encamped
against
your
enemies
you
should
avoid
anything
bad
10
If
a
man
becomes
unclean
because
of
a
nocturnal
emission
he
should
go
outside
the
camp
and
not
reenter
the
camp
11
When
evening
falls
he
should
wash
with
water
and
then
he
may
return
to
the
camp
at
sunset
12
A
private
place
should
be
designated
for
use
outside
the
camp
and
there
is
where
you
should
go
13
A
peg
should
be
part
of
your
equipment
When
you
squat
outside
you
should
dig
a
hole
with
it
and
then
cover
your
excrement
14
For
Jehovah
your
God
is
walking
about
within
your
camp
to
deliver
you
and
to
hand
over
your
enemies
to
you
and
your
camp
must
be
holy
so
that
he
does
not
see
anything
indecent
in
you
and
turn
away
from
accompanying
you
15
You
should
not
hand
over
a
slave
to
his
master
when
he
escapes
from
his
master
and
comes
to
you
16
He
may
dwell
among
you
in
whatever
place
he
chooses
in
one
of
your
cities
wherever
he
likes
You
must
not
mistreat
him
17
None
of
the
daughters
of
Israel
may
become
a
temple
prostitute
neither
may
anyone
of
the
sons
of
Israel
become
a
temple
prostitute
18
You
must
not
bring
the
price
paid
to
a
female
prostitute
or
the
price
paid
to
a
male
prostitute
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
your
God
to
fulfill
a
vow
for
both
of
them
are
something
detestable
to
Jehovah
your
God
19
You
must
not
make
your
brother
pay
interest
whether
interest
on
money
on
food
or
on
anything
on
which
interest
may
be
charged
20
You
may
make
a
foreigner
pay
interest
but
you
must
not
make
your
brother
pay
interest
so
that
Jehovah
your
God
may
bless
you
in
every
undertaking
of
yours
in
the
land
you
are
going
to
take
possession
of
21
If
you
make
a
vow
to
Jehovah
your
God
do
not
be
slow
about
paying
it
For
Jehovah
your
God
will
surely
require
it
of
you
otherwise
it
will
be
a
sin
on
your
part
22
But
if
you
refrain
from
making
a
vow
you
will
not
be
guilty
of
sin
23
The
word
of
your
lips
you
should
keep
and
you
must
carry
out
what
your
own
mouth
vowed
as
a
voluntary
offering
to
Jehovah
your
God
24
If
you
enter
your
neighbors
vineyard
you
may
eat
enough
grapes
to
satisfy
your
appetite
but
you
should
not
put
any
in
your
container
25
If
you
go
into
your
neighbors
field
of
standing
grain
you
may
pluck
the
ripe
ears
with
your
hand
but
you
should
not
put
a
sickle
to
your
neighbors
grain
1
If
a
man
marries
a
woman
but
she
does
not
please
him
because
he
found
something
indecent
about
her
he
must
write
out
a
certificate
of
divorce
for
her
hand
it
to
her
and
dismiss
her
from
his
house
2
After
she
leaves
his
house
she
may
go
and
become
another
mans
wife
3
If
the
second
man
hates
her
and
writes
out
a
certificate
of
divorce
for
her
hands
it
to
her
and
dismisses
her
from
his
house
or
if
the
second
man
who
married
her
should
die
4
her
first
husband
who
dismissed
her
will
not
be
allowed
to
take
her
back
again
as
his
wife
after
she
has
been
defiled
for
that
is
something
detestable
to
Jehovah
You
must
not
bring
sin
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
as
an
inheritance
5
When
a
man
is
newly
married
he
should
not
serve
in
the
army
or
be
given
any
other
duties
He
should
remain
exempt
for
one
year
and
stay
at
home
and
bring
joy
to
his
wife
6
No
one
should
seize
a
hand
mill
or
its
upper
millstone
as
security
for
a
loan
for
that
would
be
taking
someones
livelihood
as
security
7
If
someone
is
found
to
have
kidnapped
one
of
his
Israelite
brothers
and
he
has
mistreated
him
and
sold
him
the
kidnapper
must
die
You
should
remove
what
is
bad
from
your
midst
8
When
there
is
an
outbreak
of
leprosy
be
very
careful
to
do
according
to
all
that
the
Levitical
priests
will
instruct
you
Be
careful
to
do
exactly
as
I
commanded
them
9
Remember
what
Jehovah
your
God
did
to
Miriam
on
the
way
when
you
were
coming
out
of
Egypt
10
If
you
make
any
sort
of
loan
to
your
neighbor
you
must
not
enter
into
his
house
to
seize
from
him
what
he
has
offered
as
security
11
You
should
stand
outside
and
the
man
who
received
the
loan
should
bring
outside
to
you
what
he
is
giving
as
security
12
And
if
the
man
is
in
need
you
must
not
go
to
bed
with
what
he
gave
as
security
still
in
your
possession
13
You
should
by
all
means
return
to
him
what
he
has
given
as
security
as
soon
as
the
sun
sets
and
he
will
go
to
bed
with
his
garment
and
he
will
bless
you
and
it
will
mean
righteousness
for
you
before
Jehovah
your
God
14
You
must
not
defraud
a
hired
worker
who
is
in
need
and
poor
whether
one
of
your
brothers
or
a
foreign
resident
in
your
land
within
your
cities
15
You
should
give
him
his
wages
that
very
day
before
the
sun
sets
because
he
is
in
need
and
his
life
depends
on
his
wages
Otherwise
he
will
cry
out
to
Jehovah
against
you
and
you
will
be
guilty
of
sin
16
Fathers
should
not
be
put
to
death
for
what
their
children
do
and
children
should
not
be
put
to
death
for
what
their
fathers
do
A
person
should
be
put
to
death
only
for
his
own
sin
17
You
must
not
pervert
the
judgment
of
the
foreign
resident
or
of
the
fatherless
child
and
you
must
not
seize
the
garment
of
a
widow
as
security
for
a
loan
18
Remember
that
you
became
a
slave
in
Egypt
and
Jehovah
your
God
redeemed
you
from
there
That
is
why
I
am
commanding
you
to
do
this
19
When
you
reap
your
harvest
from
your
field
and
you
have
forgotten
a
sheaf
in
the
field
do
not
go
back
to
get
it
It
should
be
left
for
the
foreign
resident
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
so
that
Jehovah
your
God
may
bless
you
in
all
that
you
do
20
When
you
beat
your
olive
tree
you
should
not
repeat
the
procedure
on
its
branches
What
is
left
should
remain
for
the
foreign
resident
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
21
When
you
gather
the
grapes
of
your
vineyard
you
must
not
return
to
gather
the
leftovers
They
should
be
left
for
the
foreign
resident
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
22
Remember
that
you
became
a
slave
in
the
land
of
Egypt
That
is
why
I
am
commanding
you
to
do
this
1
When
a
dispute
arises
between
men
they
may
present
themselves
before
the
judges
and
they
will
judge
them
and
pronounce
the
righteous
one
innocent
and
the
wicked
one
guilty
2
If
the
wicked
one
deserves
to
be
beaten
the
judge
will
have
him
lie
down
prostrate
and
he
will
be
beaten
in
his
presence
The
number
of
strokes
should
correspond
to
the
wickedness
of
his
deed
3
He
may
beat
him
with
up
to
40
strokes
but
no
more
If
he
would
continue
beating
him
with
more
strokes
than
this
your
brother
would
be
disgraced
before
your
eyes
4
You
must
not
muzzle
a
bull
when
it
is
threshing
out
grain
5
If
brothers
dwell
together
and
one
of
them
dies
without
having
a
son
the
wife
of
the
dead
one
should
not
marry
someone
from
outside
the
family
Her
brother-in-law
should
go
to
her
take
her
as
his
wife
and
perform
brother-in-law
marriage
with
her
6
The
firstborn
whom
she
will
bear
will
carry
on
the
name
of
his
dead
brother
so
that
his
name
may
not
be
wiped
out
of
Israel
7
Now
if
the
man
does
not
want
to
marry
his
brothers
widow
his
brothers
widow
should
then
go
to
the
elders
at
the
city
gate
and
say
My
husbands
brother
has
refused
to
preserve
his
brothers
name
in
Israel
He
has
not
consented
to
perform
brother-in-law
marriage
with
me
8
The
elders
of
his
city
must
call
him
and
speak
to
him
Should
he
insist
and
say
I
do
not
want
to
marry
her

9
then
his
brothers
widow
should
approach
him
before
the
elders
remove
his
sandal
from
his
foot
spit
in
his
face
and
say
That
is
what
should
be
done
to
the
man
who
will
not
build
up
his
brothers
household
10
After
that
his
family
name
in
Israel
will
be
known
as
The
house
of
the
one
who
had
his
sandal
removed
11
If
two
men
get
into
a
fight
with
each
other
and
the
wife
of
the
one
intervenes
to
protect
her
husband
from
the
one
striking
him
and
she
reaches
out
her
hand
and
grabs
hold
of
him
by
his
private
parts
12
you
must
amputate
her
hand
You
should
not
feel
sorry
13
You
must
not
have
in
your
bag
two
different
stone
weights
a
large
one
and
a
small
one
14
You
must
not
have
in
your
house
two
different
measuring
containers
a
large
one
and
a
small
one
15
You
should
keep
an
accurate
and
honest
weight
and
an
accurate
and
honest
measure
so
that
you
will
live
long
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
16
For
every
unjust
person
who
does
such
things
is
detestable
to
Jehovah
your
God
17
Remember
what
Amalek
did
to
you
on
the
way
as
you
were
coming
out
of
Egypt
18
how
he
met
you
along
the
way
and
attacked
all
those
straggling
behind
you
when
you
were
exhausted
and
weary
He
did
not
fear
God
19
When
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
rest
from
all
your
enemies
around
you
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
as
an
inheritance
to
possess
you
should
wipe
out
the
mention
of
Amalek
from
under
the
heavens
You
must
not
forget
1
When
eventually
you
enter
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
as
an
inheritance
and
you
have
taken
possession
of
it
and
are
dwelling
in
it
2
you
are
to
take
some
of
the
firstfruits
of
all
the
produce
of
the
ground
which
you
will
gather
from
your
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
and
put
them
in
a
basket
and
go
to
the
place
that
Jehovah
your
God
chooses
to
have
his
name
reside
3
You
must
go
to
the
priest
who
will
be
serving
in
those
days
and
say
to
him
Today
I
am
reporting
to
Jehovah
your
God
that
I
have
come
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
swore
to
our
forefathers
to
give
to
us
4
The
priest
will
then
take
the
basket
out
of
your
hand
and
deposit
it
before
the
altar
of
Jehovah
your
God
5
Then
you
are
to
declare
before
Jehovah
your
God
My
father
was
a
wandering
Aramaean
and
he
went
down
to
Egypt
and
resided
there
as
a
foreigner
with
few
in
his
household
But
there
he
became
a
great
nation
mighty
and
numerous
6
And
the
Egyptians
mistreated
and
oppressed
us
and
imposed
harsh
slavery
on
us
7
So
we
began
to
cry
out
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
our
forefathers
and
Jehovah
heard
our
voice
and
looked
upon
our
affliction
and
our
trouble
and
our
oppression
8
Finally
Jehovah
brought
us
out
of
Egypt
with
a
mighty
hand
and
an
outstretched
arm
and
with
terrifying
deeds
and
with
signs
and
miracles
9
Then
he
brought
us
to
this
place
and
gave
us
this
land
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
10
Now
I
have
brought
the
firstfruits
of
the
produce
of
the
ground
that
Jehovah
has
given
me
You
must
deposit
it
before
Jehovah
your
God
and
bow
down
before
Jehovah
your
God
11
You
will
then
rejoice
over
all
the
good
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
and
your
household
you
and
the
Levite
and
the
foreign
resident
who
is
among
you
12
When
you
finish
tithing
the
entire
tenth
of
your
produce
in
the
third
year
the
year
of
the
tenth
you
will
give
it
to
the
Levite
the
foreign
resident
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
and
they
will
eat
their
fill
within
your
cities
13
You
will
then
say
before
Jehovah
your
God
I
have
cleared
the
holy
portion
out
of
my
house
and
given
it
to
the
Levite
the
foreign
resident
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
just
as
you
have
commanded
me
I
have
not
violated
or
neglected
your
commandments
14
I
have
not
eaten
of
it
while
mourning
or
removed
any
of
it
while
unclean
or
given
any
of
it
for
the
dead
I
have
obeyed
the
voice
of
Jehovah
my
God
and
have
done
all
that
you
commanded
me
15
Now
look
down
from
your
holy
dwelling
the
heavens
and
bless
your
people
Israel
and
the
land
that
you
have
given
us
just
as
you
swore
to
our
forefathers
the
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
16
This
day
Jehovah
your
God
is
commanding
you
to
carry
out
these
regulations
and
judicial
decisions
You
must
observe
them
and
carry
them
out
with
all
your
heart
and
all
your
soul
17
Today
you
have
obtained
Jehovahs
declaration
that
he
will
become
your
God
as
you
walk
in
his
ways
and
observe
his
regulations
his
commandments
and
his
judicial
decisions
and
as
you
listen
to
his
voice
18
And
today
Jehovah
has
obtained
your
declaration
that
you
will
become
his
people
his
special
property
just
as
he
has
promised
you
and
that
you
will
observe
all
his
commandments
19
and
that
he
will
put
you
high
above
all
the
other
nations
that
he
has
made
giving
you
praise
and
fame
and
glory
as
you
prove
yourself
a
people
holy
to
Jehovah
your
God
just
as
he
has
promised
1
Then
Moses
together
with
the
elders
of
Israel
commanded
the
people
saying
Observe
every
commandment
that
I
am
giving
you
today
2
And
in
the
day
when
you
will
cross
the
Jordan
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
set
up
large
stones
and
cover
them
with
plaster
3
Then
write
on
them
all
the
words
of
this
Law
when
you
have
crossed
over
so
that
you
may
enter
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
just
as
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
has
promised
you
4
When
you
have
crossed
the
Jordan
you
should
set
up
these
stones
on
Mount
Ebal
and
cover
them
with
plaster
just
as
I
am
commanding
you
today
5
You
are
also
to
build
an
altar
there
to
Jehovah
your
God
an
altar
of
stones
You
should
not
use
iron
tools
on
them
6
You
should
build
the
altar
of
Jehovah
your
God
with
whole
stones
and
offer
burnt
offerings
to
Jehovah
your
God
on
it
7
You
are
to
offer
communion
sacrifices
and
eat
them
there
and
you
will
rejoice
before
Jehovah
your
God
8
And
clearly
write
on
the
stones
all
the
words
of
this
Law
9
Then
Moses
and
the
Levitical
priests
spoke
to
all
Israel
saying
Keep
silent
and
listen
O
Israel
This
day
you
have
become
the
people
of
Jehovah
your
God
10
You
must
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
carry
out
his
commandments
and
his
regulations
which
I
am
commanding
you
today
11
On
that
day
Moses
commanded
the
people
saying
12
The
following
tribes
will
stand
on
Mount
Gerizim
to
bless
the
people
when
you
have
crossed
the
Jordan
Simeon
Levi
Judah
Issachar
Joseph
and
Benjamin
13
And
the
following
will
stand
on
Mount
Ebal
to
pronounce
the
curse
Reuben
Gad
Asher
Zebulun
Dan
and
Naphtali
14
And
the
Levites
will
answer
every
man
of
Israel
with
a
loud
voice
15
Cursed
is
the
man
who
makes
a
carved
image
or
a
metal
statue
a
thing
detestable
to
Jehovah
the
workmanship
of
the
hands
of
a
craftsman
and
who
has
hidden
it
And
all
the
people
will
respond
saying
Amen
16
Cursed
is
the
one
who
treats
his
father
or
his
mother
with
contempt
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
17
Cursed
is
the
one
who
moves
his
neighbors
boundary
marker
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
18
Cursed
is
the
one
who
causes
a
blind
person
to
lose
his
way
on
the
road
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
19
Cursed
is
the
one
who
perverts
the
judgment
of
a
foreign
resident
a
fatherless
child
or
a
widow
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
20
Cursed
is
the
one
who
lies
down
with
his
fathers
wife
for
he
has
dishonored
his
father
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
21
Cursed
is
the
one
who
lies
down
with
any
animal
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
22
Cursed
is
the
one
who
lies
down
with
his
sister
the
daughter
of
his
father
or
the
daughter
of
his
mother
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
23
Cursed
is
the
one
who
lies
down
with
his
mother-in-law
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
24
Cursed
is
the
one
who
ambushes
and
kills
his
neighbor
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
25
Cursed
is
the
one
who
accepts
a
bribe
to
kill
an
innocent
person
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
26
Cursed
is
the
one
who
will
not
uphold
the
words
of
this
Law
by
carrying
them
out
And
all
the
people
will
say
Amen
1
And
if
you
will
without
fail
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
by
being
careful
to
do
all
his
commandments
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
Jehovah
your
God
will
certainly
put
you
high
above
all
other
nations
of
the
earth
2
All
these
blessings
will
come
upon
you
and
overtake
you
because
you
keep
listening
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
3
Blessed
you
will
be
in
the
city
and
blessed
you
will
be
in
the
field
4
Blessed
will
be
your
children
and
the
fruit
of
your
ground
and
the
offspring
of
your
livestock
your
young
cattle
and
sheep
5
Blessed
will
be
your
basket
and
your
kneading
bowl
6
Blessed
you
will
be
when
you
come
in
and
blessed
you
will
be
when
you
go
out
7
Jehovah
will
cause
your
enemies
who
rise
up
against
you
to
be
defeated
before
you
They
will
attack
you
from
one
direction
but
they
will
flee
from
you
in
seven
different
directions
8
Jehovah
will
decree
for
you
a
blessing
on
your
storehouses
and
every
undertaking
of
yours
and
he
will
certainly
bless
you
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
9
Jehovah
will
establish
you
as
a
holy
people
to
himself
just
as
he
swore
to
you
because
you
continue
to
keep
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
walk
in
his
ways
10
All
the
peoples
of
the
earth
will
have
to
see
that
Jehovahs
name
has
been
called
upon
you
and
they
will
be
afraid
of
you
11
Jehovah
will
make
you
overflow
with
many
children
and
much
livestock
and
fruitful
ground
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
swore
to
your
forefathers
to
give
you
12
Jehovah
will
open
up
to
you
his
good
storehouse
the
heavens
to
give
your
land
rain
in
its
season
and
to
bless
all
that
you
do
You
will
lend
to
many
nations
while
you
yourself
will
not
need
to
borrow
13
Jehovah
will
make
you
the
head
and
not
the
tail
and
you
will
be
on
top
and
not
on
the
bottom
if
you
keep
obeying
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
your
God
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
to
observe
and
to
do
14
You
must
not
deviate
from
all
the
words
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
to
walk
after
other
gods
to
serve
them
15
But
if
you
will
not
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
by
taking
care
to
do
all
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
all
these
curses
will
come
upon
you
and
overtake
you
16
Cursed
you
will
be
in
the
city
and
cursed
you
will
be
in
the
field
17
Cursed
will
be
your
basket
and
your
kneading
bowl
18
Cursed
will
be
your
children
and
the
fruit
of
your
ground
and
your
young
cattle
and
sheep
19
Cursed
you
will
be
when
you
come
in
and
cursed
you
will
be
when
you
go
out
20
Jehovah
will
send
upon
you
the
curse
confusion
and
punishment
in
every
undertaking
of
yours
until
you
have
been
annihilated
and
have
quickly
perished
because
of
your
bad
practices
and
your
forsaking
me
21
Jehovah
will
cause
the
disease
to
cling
to
you
until
he
has
exterminated
you
from
the
land
you
are
going
to
take
possession
of
22
Jehovah
will
strike
you
with
tuberculosis
burning
fever
inflammation
feverish
heat
the
sword
scorching
blight
and
mildew
and
they
will
pursue
you
until
you
have
perished
23
The
skies
over
your
head
will
be
copper
and
the
earth
beneath
you
iron
24
Jehovah
will
make
the
rain
of
your
land
powder
and
dust
that
will
come
down
on
you
from
the
heavens
until
you
have
been
annihilated
25
Jehovah
will
cause
you
to
be
defeated
before
your
enemies
You
will
attack
them
from
one
direction
but
you
will
flee
from
them
in
seven
different
directions
and
you
will
become
an
object
of
horror
to
all
the
earths
kingdoms
26
And
your
carcasses
will
become
food
for
every
bird
of
the
sky
and
animal
of
the
ground
with
no
one
to
frighten
them
away
27
Jehovah
will
strike
you
with
the
boils
of
Egypt
piles
eczema
and
skin
lesions
from
which
you
cannot
be
healed
28
Jehovah
will
strike
you
with
madness
and
blindness
and
confusion
29
You
will
grope
about
at
midday
just
as
a
blind
man
gropes
about
in
darkness
and
you
will
not
succeed
in
anything
you
do
and
you
will
be
constantly
defrauded
and
robbed
with
no
one
to
save
you
30
You
will
become
engaged
to
a
woman
but
another
man
will
rape
her
You
will
build
a
house
but
you
will
not
live
in
it
You
will
plant
a
vineyard
but
you
will
not
begin
to
use
it
31
Your
bull
will
be
slaughtered
before
your
eyes
but
you
will
not
eat
any
of
it
Your
donkey
will
be
stolen
right
in
front
of
you
but
it
will
not
return
to
you
Your
sheep
will
be
given
to
your
enemies
but
you
will
have
no
savior
32
Your
sons
and
your
daughters
will
be
given
to
another
people
while
you
look
on
and
you
will
always
long
for
them
but
your
hands
will
be
powerless
33
The
fruitage
of
your
ground
and
all
that
you
produce
will
be
eaten
by
a
people
whom
you
have
not
known
and
you
will
always
be
defrauded
and
crushed
34
You
will
be
driven
mad
by
what
your
eyes
see
35
Jehovah
will
strike
you
with
painful
and
incurable
boils
on
your
knees
and
legs
from
the
sole
of
your
foot
to
the
crown
of
your
head
36
Jehovah
will
drive
you
and
the
king
whom
you
set
up
over
yourself
to
a
nation
that
you
and
your
forefathers
have
not
known
and
there
you
will
serve
other
gods
gods
of
wood
and
of
stone
37
And
you
will
become
an
object
of
horror
and
of
scorn
and
a
cause
for
ridicule
among
all
the
peoples
to
whom
Jehovah
drives
you
38
You
will
take
much
seed
out
into
the
field
but
you
will
gather
little
because
the
locust
will
devour
it
39
Vineyards
you
will
plant
and
cultivate
but
you
will
drink
no
wine
and
gather
nothing
because
the
worm
will
consume
it
40
You
will
have
olive
trees
in
all
your
territory
but
you
will
rub
no
oil
on
yourself
because
your
olives
will
drop
off
41
Sons
and
daughters
you
will
bear
but
they
will
not
remain
yours
because
they
will
go
off
into
captivity
42
Swarms
of
insects
will
overwhelm
all
your
trees
and
the
fruitage
of
your
ground
43
The
foreign
resident
who
is
in
your
midst
will
keep
ascending
higher
and
higher
over
you
while
you
yourself
will
keep
descending
lower
and
lower
44
He
will
lend
to
you
but
you
will
not
lend
to
him
He
will
become
the
head
while
you
yourself
will
become
the
tail
45
All
these
curses
will
certainly
come
upon
you
and
pursue
you
and
overtake
you
until
you
have
been
annihilated
because
you
did
not
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
by
keeping
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
that
he
commanded
you
46
And
they
will
continue
on
you
and
your
offspring
as
a
permanent
sign
and
portent
47
because
you
did
not
serve
Jehovah
your
God
with
rejoicing
and
joy
of
heart
when
you
had
such
an
abundance
of
everything
48
Jehovah
will
send
your
enemies
against
you
and
you
will
serve
them
while
you
are
hungry
and
thirsty
and
poorly
clothed
and
lacking
everything
He
will
put
an
iron
yoke
on
your
neck
until
he
has
annihilated
you
49
Jehovah
will
raise
up
against
you
a
distant
nation
from
the
end
of
the
earth
it
will
pounce
like
an
eagle
a
nation
whose
language
you
will
not
understand
50
a
nation
fierce
in
appearance
that
will
show
no
regard
to
the
old
or
favor
to
the
young
51
They
will
eat
the
offspring
of
your
livestock
and
the
fruitage
of
your
ground
until
you
have
been
annihilated
They
will
not
leave
any
grain
new
wine
or
oil
young
cattle
or
sheep
for
you
until
they
have
destroyed
you
52
They
will
besiege
you
shutting
you
up
inside
all
your
cities
throughout
your
land
until
your
high
and
fortified
walls
that
you
are
trusting
in
fall
down
Yes
they
will
certainly
besiege
you
within
all
your
cities
throughout
your
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
53
Then
you
will
have
to
eat
your
own
children
the
flesh
of
your
sons
and
your
daughters
whom
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
because
of
the
severity
of
the
siege
and
the
distress
your
enemy
inflicts
on
you
54
Even
the
most
delicate
and
sensitive
man
among
you
will
have
no
pity
on
his
brother
or
his
cherished
wife
or
his
sons
who
remain
55
and
he
will
not
share
with
them
any
of
the
flesh
of
his
sons
that
he
will
eat
because
he
has
nothing
else
on
account
of
the
severity
of
the
siege
and
the
distress
your
enemy
inflicts
on
your
cities
56
And
the
delicate
and
sensitive
woman
among
you
who
would
not
even
think
of
putting
the
sole
of
her
foot
on
the
ground
because
she
is
so
delicate
will
show
no
pity
to
her
cherished
husband
or
her
son
or
her
daughter
57
even
toward
the
afterbirth
that
comes
from
between
her
legs
and
toward
the
sons
she
bears
for
she
will
secretly
eat
them
because
of
the
severity
of
the
siege
and
the
distress
your
enemy
inflicts
on
your
cities
58
If
you
will
not
carefully
observe
all
the
words
of
this
Law
that
are
written
in
this
book
and
you
do
not
fear
this
glorious
and
awe-inspiring
name
that
of
Jehovah
your
God
59
Jehovah
will
inflict
very
severe
plagues
on
you
and
your
offspring
great
and
enduring
plagues
and
grievous
and
enduring
sicknesses
60
He
will
bring
back
upon
you
all
the
diseases
of
Egypt
that
you
used
to
fear
and
they
will
certainly
cling
to
you
61
Moreover
Jehovah
will
even
bring
upon
you
every
sickness
or
plague
not
written
in
the
book
of
this
Law
until
you
have
been
annihilated
62
Although
you
have
become
as
numerous
as
the
stars
of
the
heavens
very
few
of
your
number
will
be
left
because
you
did
not
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
63
And
just
as
Jehovah
once
delighted
to
make
you
prosper
and
to
multiply
you
so
Jehovah
will
delight
to
destroy
you
and
to
annihilate
you
and
you
will
be
torn
from
the
land
you
are
about
to
possess
64
Jehovah
will
scatter
you
among
all
the
nations
from
the
one
end
of
the
earth
to
the
other
end
of
the
earth
and
there
you
will
have
to
serve
gods
of
wood
and
of
stone
which
you
and
your
forefathers
have
not
known
65
You
will
have
no
peace
among
those
nations
nor
a
place
of
rest
for
the
sole
of
your
foot
Rather
Jehovah
will
give
you
there
an
anxious
heart
and
failing
eyes
and
a
feeling
of
despair
66
Your
life
will
be
in
great
peril
and
you
will
feel
dread
night
and
day
and
you
will
be
uncertain
of
your
survival
67
In
the
morning
you
will
say
If
only
it
were
evening
and
in
the
evening
you
will
say
If
only
it
were
morning
because
of
the
dread
you
will
feel
in
your
heart
and
because
of
what
your
eyes
will
see
68
And
Jehovah
will
certainly
bring
you
back
to
Egypt
by
ship
by
the
way
that
I
told
you
You
will
never
see
it
again

and
there
you
will
have
to
sell
yourselves
to
your
enemies
as
male
and
female
slaves
but
there
will
be
no
buyer
1
These
are
the
words
of
the
covenant
that
Jehovah
commanded
Moses
to
make
with
the
people
of
Israel
in
the
land
of
Moab
in
addition
to
the
covenant
that
he
made
with
them
at
Horeb
2
Moses
then
called
together
all
Israel
and
said
to
them
You
have
seen
all
that
Jehovah
did
before
your
eyes
in
the
land
of
Egypt
to
Pharaoh
and
all
his
servants
and
all
his
land
3
the
great
judgments
that
your
eyes
saw
those
great
signs
and
miracles
4
But
Jehovah
has
not
given
you
a
heart
to
understand
and
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
down
to
this
day
5
While
I
kept
guiding
you
for
40
years
in
the
wilderness
your
garments
did
not
wear
out
on
you
and
your
sandals
did
not
wear
out
on
your
feet
6
You
did
not
eat
bread
and
you
did
not
drink
wine
or
anything
alcoholic
so
that
you
would
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
7
You
eventually
came
to
this
place
and
Sihon
the
king
of
Heshbon
and
Og
the
king
of
Bashan
came
out
to
meet
us
in
battle
but
we
defeated
them
8
After
that
we
took
their
land
and
gave
it
as
an
inheritance
to
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
the
Manassites
9
Therefore
observe
the
words
of
this
covenant
and
obey
them
so
that
everything
you
do
will
turn
out
well
10
All
of
you
are
stationed
today
before
Jehovah
your
God
the
heads
of
your
tribes
your
elders
your
officers
every
man
of
Israel
11
your
children
your
wives
and
your
foreign
resident
who
is
in
the
midst
of
your
camp
from
the
one
gathering
your
wood
to
the
one
drawing
your
water
12
You
are
here
in
order
to
enter
into
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
his
oath
which
Jehovah
your
God
is
making
with
you
today
13
in
order
that
he
may
establish
you
today
as
his
people
and
that
he
may
be
your
God
just
as
he
has
promised
you
and
just
as
he
swore
to
your
forefathers
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
14
Now
it
is
not
with
you
alone
that
I
am
making
this
covenant
and
this
oath
15
but
it
is
with
those
standing
here
with
us
today
before
Jehovah
our
God
and
with
those
who
are
not
here
with
us
today
16
For
you
well
know
how
we
lived
in
the
land
of
Egypt
and
how
we
passed
through
the
midst
of
various
nations
on
our
journey
17
And
you
used
to
see
their
detestable
things
and
their
disgusting
idols
of
wood
and
stone
silver
and
gold
that
were
among
them
18
Beware
that
there
may
not
be
a
man
or
a
woman
a
family
or
a
tribe
among
you
today
whose
heart
turns
away
from
Jehovah
our
God
to
go
serve
the
gods
of
those
nations
that
there
may
not
be
a
root
among
you
producing
poisonous
fruit
and
wormwood
19
But
if
someone
hears
the
words
of
this
oath
and
boasts
in
his
heart
saying
I
will
have
peace
though
I
insist
on
walking
in
the
ways
of
my
own
heart

to
the
ruin
of
everything
in
his
path
20
Jehovah
will
not
be
willing
to
forgive
him
Instead
Jehovahs
great
anger
will
blaze
against
that
man
and
the
entire
curse
written
in
this
book
will
certainly
come
upon
him
and
Jehovah
will
indeed
wipe
out
his
name
from
under
the
heavens
21
Jehovah
will
then
single
him
out
from
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
for
calamity
in
accord
with
the
entire
curse
of
the
covenant
that
is
written
in
this
book
of
the
Law
22
When
the
future
generation
of
your
sons
and
the
foreigner
from
a
distant
land
see
the
plagues
of
the
land
the
maladies
that
Jehovah
has
brought
upon
it—
23
sulfur
and
salt
and
burning
so
that
its
whole
land
will
not
be
sown
or
sprout
nor
will
any
vegetation
spring
up
in
it
like
the
overthrow
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
Admah
and
Zeboiim
which
Jehovah
overthrew
in
his
anger
and
in
his
wrath—
24
they
and
all
the
nations
will
say
Why
did
Jehovah
do
this
to
this
land
What
caused
this
great
burning
anger
25
Then
they
will
say
It
was
because
they
abandoned
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
which
he
made
with
them
when
he
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
26
But
they
went
and
served
other
gods
and
bowed
down
to
them
gods
that
they
had
not
known
and
that
he
had
not
permitted
them
to
worship
27
Then
Jehovahs
burning
anger
came
against
that
land
by
bringing
upon
it
the
entire
curse
written
in
this
book
28
Therefore
Jehovah
uprooted
them
from
their
soil
in
his
anger
and
fury
and
great
indignation
and
deported
them
to
another
land
where
they
are
today
29
The
things
concealed
belong
to
Jehovah
our
God
but
the
things
revealed
belong
to
us
and
to
our
descendants
forever
so
that
we
may
carry
out
all
the
words
of
this
Law
1
When
all
these
words
come
upon
you
the
blessing
and
the
curse
that
I
have
put
before
you
and
you
call
them
to
mind
in
all
the
nations
where
Jehovah
your
God
has
dispersed
you
2
and
you
return
to
Jehovah
your
God
and
listen
to
his
voice
according
to
all
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
you
and
your
sons
with
all
your
heart
and
all
your
soul
3
Jehovah
your
God
will
then
bring
back
your
captives
and
show
you
mercy
and
regather
you
from
all
the
peoples
where
Jehovah
your
God
has
scattered
you
4
Even
if
your
people
are
dispersed
to
the
extremity
of
the
heavens
from
there
Jehovah
your
God
will
gather
you
and
bring
you
back
5
Jehovah
your
God
will
bring
you
into
the
land
your
fathers
took
possession
of
and
you
will
possess
it
and
he
will
make
you
prosper
and
will
multiply
you
more
than
your
fathers
6
Jehovah
your
God
will
cleanse
your
heart
and
the
heart
of
your
offspring
so
that
you
will
love
Jehovah
your
God
with
all
your
heart
and
all
your
soul
and
you
may
live
7
Then
Jehovah
your
God
will
bring
all
these
curses
upon
your
enemies
who
hated
and
persecuted
you
8
You
will
then
return
and
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
and
observe
all
his
commandments
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
9
Jehovah
your
God
will
make
you
abundantly
prosperous
in
all
the
work
of
your
hands
multiplying
your
children
and
your
livestock
and
the
produce
of
your
ground
for
Jehovah
will
again
delight
to
make
you
prosper
just
as
he
delighted
in
your
forefathers
10
For
then
you
will
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
keep
his
commandments
and
statutes
written
in
this
book
of
the
Law
and
you
will
return
to
Jehovah
your
God
with
all
your
heart
and
all
your
soul
11
Now
this
commandment
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
is
not
too
difficult
for
you
nor
is
it
beyond
your
reach
12
It
is
not
in
the
heavens
so
that
you
have
to
say
Who
will
ascend
to
the
heavens
and
get
it
for
us
so
that
we
may
hear
it
and
observe
it
13
Nor
is
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
so
that
you
have
to
say
Who
will
cross
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
sea
and
get
it
for
us
so
that
we
may
hear
it
and
observe
it
14
For
the
word
is
very
near
you
in
your
own
mouth
and
in
your
own
heart
so
that
you
may
do
it
15
See
I
do
put
before
you
today
life
and
good
and
death
and
bad
16
If
you
listen
to
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
your
God
that
I
am
commanding
you
today
by
loving
Jehovah
your
God
by
walking
in
his
ways
and
by
keeping
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
and
his
judicial
decisions
then
you
will
live
and
multiply
and
Jehovah
your
God
will
bless
you
in
the
land
you
are
going
to
possess
17
But
if
your
heart
turns
away
and
you
do
not
listen
and
you
are
enticed
and
bow
down
to
other
gods
and
serve
them
18
I
tell
you
today
that
you
will
certainly
perish
You
will
not
live
long
in
the
land
you
are
crossing
the
Jordan
to
possess
19
I
take
the
heavens
and
the
earth
as
witnesses
against
you
today
that
I
have
put
life
and
death
before
you
the
blessing
and
the
curse
and
you
must
choose
life
so
that
you
may
live
you
and
your
descendants
20
by
loving
Jehovah
your
God
by
listening
to
his
voice
and
by
sticking
to
him
for
he
is
your
life
and
by
him
you
will
endure
a
long
time
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
swore
to
give
to
your
forefathers
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
1
Then
Moses
went
out
and
spoke
these
words
to
all
Israel
2
saying
to
them
I
am
120
years
old
today
I
can
no
longer
lead
you
for
Jehovah
has
said
to
me
You
will
not
cross
this
Jordan
3
Jehovah
your
God
is
the
one
crossing
before
you
and
he
himself
will
annihilate
these
nations
before
you
and
you
will
drive
them
away
Joshua
is
the
one
who
will
lead
you
across
just
as
Jehovah
has
spoken
4
Jehovah
will
do
to
them
just
as
he
did
to
Sihon
and
to
Og
the
kings
of
the
Amorites
and
to
their
land
when
he
annihilated
them
5
Jehovah
will
defeat
them
for
you
and
you
are
to
do
to
them
according
to
the
whole
commandment
that
I
have
given
you
6
Be
courageous
and
strong
Do
not
be
afraid
or
struck
with
terror
before
them
for
Jehovah
your
God
is
the
one
marching
with
you
He
will
neither
desert
you
nor
abandon
you
7
Moses
then
called
Joshua
and
said
to
him
before
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
Be
courageous
and
strong
for
you
are
the
one
who
will
bring
this
people
into
the
land
that
Jehovah
swore
to
their
forefathers
to
give
to
them
and
you
will
give
it
to
them
as
an
inheritance
8
Jehovah
is
the
one
marching
before
you
and
he
will
continue
with
you
He
will
neither
desert
you
nor
abandon
you
Do
not
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
9
Then
Moses
wrote
this
Law
and
gave
it
to
the
priests
the
Levites
who
carry
the
ark
of
Jehovahs
covenant
and
to
all
the
elders
of
Israel
10
Moses
commanded
them
saying
At
the
end
of
every
seven
years
at
the
appointed
time
in
the
year
of
the
release
during
the
Festival
of
Booths
11
when
all
Israel
appears
before
the
presence
of
Jehovah
your
God
in
the
place
that
he
chooses
you
should
read
this
Law
for
all
Israel
to
hear
it
12
Gather
the
people
together
the
men
the
women
the
children
and
your
foreign
resident
who
is
within
your
cities
in
order
that
they
may
listen
and
learn
about
and
fear
Jehovah
your
God
and
take
care
to
carry
out
all
the
words
of
this
Law
13
Then
their
sons
who
have
not
known
this
Law
will
listen
and
learn
to
fear
Jehovah
your
God
all
the
days
that
you
live
in
the
land
that
you
are
crossing
the
Jordan
to
possess
14
Jehovah
then
said
to
Moses
Look
The
time
has
drawn
near
for
you
to
die
Call
Joshua
and
present
yourselves
at
the
tent
of
meeting
so
that
I
may
commission
him
So
Moses
and
Joshua
went
and
presented
themselves
at
the
tent
of
meeting
15
Then
Jehovah
appeared
at
the
tent
in
the
pillar
of
cloud
and
the
pillar
of
cloud
stood
by
the
entrance
of
the
tent
16
Jehovah
now
said
to
Moses
Look
You
are
about
to
die
and
this
people
will
begin
to
commit
spiritual
prostitution
with
the
foreign
gods
that
are
around
them
in
the
land
to
which
they
are
going
They
will
forsake
me
and
break
my
covenant
that
I
have
made
with
them
17
At
that
time
my
anger
will
blaze
against
them
and
I
will
forsake
them
and
hide
my
face
from
them
until
they
are
devoured
Then
after
many
calamities
and
distresses
have
come
upon
them
they
will
say
Is
it
not
because
our
God
is
not
in
our
midst
that
these
calamities
have
come
upon
us
18
But
I
will
keep
my
face
hidden
in
that
day
because
of
all
the
wickedness
that
they
have
done
in
turning
to
other
gods
19
Now
write
down
this
song
for
yourselves
and
teach
it
to
the
Israelites
Have
them
learn
it
in
order
that
this
song
may
serve
as
my
witness
against
the
people
of
Israel
20
When
I
bring
them
to
the
land
that
I
have
sworn
about
to
their
forefathers—one
flowing
with
milk
and
honey—and
they
eat
their
fill
and
prosper
they
will
turn
to
other
gods
and
serve
them
and
treat
me
with
disrespect
and
break
my
covenant
21
When
many
calamities
and
distresses
come
upon
them
this
song
will
serve
as
a
witness
to
them
for
their
descendants
should
not
forget
it
for
I
already
know
the
inclination
that
they
have
developed
even
before
I
bring
them
into
the
land
about
which
I
have
sworn
22
So
Moses
wrote
down
this
song
in
that
day
and
taught
it
to
the
Israelites
23
He
then
commissioned
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
and
said
Be
courageous
and
strong
for
you
are
the
one
who
will
bring
the
Israelites
into
the
land
about
which
I
have
sworn
to
them
and
I
will
continue
with
you
24
As
soon
as
Moses
had
completed
writing
the
words
of
this
Law
in
a
book
in
their
entirety
25
Moses
commanded
the
Levites
who
carry
the
ark
of
Jehovahs
covenant
saying
26
Take
this
book
of
the
Law
and
place
it
at
the
side
of
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
it
will
serve
as
a
witness
there
against
you
27
For
I
myself
well
know
your
rebelliousness
and
your
stubbornness
If
you
have
been
so
rebellious
against
Jehovah
while
I
am
still
alive
with
you
then
how
much
more
so
will
you
be
after
my
death
28
Gather
together
to
me
all
the
elders
of
your
tribes
and
your
officers
and
let
me
speak
these
words
in
their
hearing
and
let
me
take
the
heavens
and
the
earth
as
witnesses
against
them
29
For
I
well
know
that
after
my
death
you
will
surely
act
wickedly
and
turn
aside
from
the
way
about
which
I
have
commanded
you
And
calamity
will
certainly
befall
you
at
the
close
of
the
days
because
you
will
do
what
is
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
you
will
offend
him
by
the
works
of
your
hands
30
Then
in
the
hearing
of
the
entire
congregation
of
Israel
Moses
recited
the
words
of
this
song
from
beginning
to
end
1
Give
ear
O
heavens
and
I
will
speak
And
let
the
earth
hear
the
words
of
my
mouth

2
My
instruction
will
fall
as
the
rain
My
words
will
trickle
as
the
dew
As
gentle
rains
upon
grassAnd
as
copious
showers
upon
vegetation

3
For
I
will
declare
the
name
of
Jehovah
Tell
about
the
greatness
of
our
God

4
The
Rock
perfect
is
his
activity
For
all
his
ways
are
justice
A
God
of
faithfulness
who
is
never
unjust
Righteous
and
upright
is
he

5
They
are
the
ones
who
have
acted
corruptly
They
are
not
his
children
the
defect
is
their
own
They
are
a
crooked
and
twisted
generation

6
Is
this
the
way
that
you
should
treat
Jehovah
O
foolish
and
unwise
people
Is
he
not
your
Father
who
caused
your
existence
The
One
who
made
you
and
firmly
established
you

7
Remember
the
days
of
old
Consider
the
years
of
past
generations
Ask
your
father
and
he
can
tell
you
Your
elders
and
they
will
inform
you

8
When
the
Most
High
gave
the
nations
their
inheritance
When
he
divided
the
sons
of
Adam
from
one
another
He
fixed
the
boundary
of
the
peoplesWith
regard
for
the
number
of
the
sons
of
Israel

9
For
Jehovahs
people
are
his
portion
Jacob
is
his
inheritance
10
He
found
him
in
a
wilderness
landAnd
in
an
empty
howling
desert
He
protectively
encircled
him
took
care
of
him
And
safeguarded
him
as
the
pupil
of
his
eye
11
Just
as
an
eagle
stirs
up
its
nest
Hovers
over
its
fledglings
Spreading
out
its
wings
taking
them
Carrying
them
on
its
pinions
12
Jehovah
alone
kept
leading
him
No
foreign
god
was
with
him
13
He
made
him
ride
upon
earths
high
places
So
that
he
ate
the
produce
of
the
field
He
nourished
him
with
honey
from
the
cragAnd
oil
out
of
a
flinty
rock
14
Butter
of
the
herd
and
milk
of
the
flock
Together
with
the
choicest
sheep
And
rams
of
Bashan
and
he-goats
Together
with
the
finest
wheat
And
you
drank
wine
from
the
blood
of
grapes
15
When
Jeshurun
grew
fat
he
kicked
out
rebelliously
You
have
grown
fat
you
have
become
stout
you
have
become
bloated
So
he
forsook
God
who
made
him
And
despised
the
Rock
of
his
salvation
16
They
incited
him
to
fury
with
foreign
gods
They
were
offending
him
with
detestable
things
17
They
were
sacrificing
to
demons
not
to
God
To
gods
that
they
had
not
known
New
ones
that
came
along
recently
To
gods
that
your
forefathers
did
not
know
18
You
forgot
the
Rock
who
fathered
you
And
you
did
not
remember
the
God
who
gave
birth
to
you
19
When
Jehovah
saw
it
he
rejected
themBecause
his
sons
and
his
daughters
offended
him
20
So
he
said
I
will
hide
my
face
from
them
I
will
see
what
will
become
of
them
For
they
are
a
perverse
generation
Sons
in
whom
there
is
no
faithfulness
21
They
have
incited
me
to
fury
with
what
is
not
a
god
They
have
offended
me
with
their
worthless
idols
So
I
will
incite
them
to
jealousy
with
what
is
not
a
people
I
will
offend
them
with
a
foolish
nation
22
For
my
anger
has
kindled
a
fireThat
will
burn
to
the
depths
of
the
Grave
And
it
will
consume
the
earth
and
its
produceAnd
will
set
ablaze
the
foundations
of
mountains
23
I
will
increase
their
calamities
I
will
use
up
my
arrows
on
them
24
They
will
be
exhausted
from
hungerAnd
eaten
up
by
burning
fever
and
bitter
destruction
I
will
send
the
teeth
of
beasts
against
themAnd
the
venom
of
reptiles
of
the
dust
25
Outside
a
sword
will
bereave
them
Inside
there
is
terrorFor
both
young
man
and
virgin
Infant
together
with
gray-haired
man
26
I
would
have
said
I
will
scatter
them
I
will
make
the
memory
of
them
cease
from
among
men

27
If
not
for
my
dread
of
the
enemys
reaction
Because
the
adversaries
might
misconstrue
it
They
might
say
Our
power
has
triumphed
It
was
not
Jehovah
who
did
all
of
this
28
For
they
are
a
nation
devoid
of
sense
And
there
is
no
understanding
among
them
29
If
only
they
were
wise
They
would
ponder
over
this
They
would
think
about
their
outcome
30
How
could
one
chase
after
1000
And
two
put
10000
to
flight
Not
unless
their
Rock
had
sold
themAnd
Jehovah
had
surrendered
them
31
For
their
rock
is
not
like
our
Rock
Even
our
enemies
have
understood
this
32
For
their
vine
is
from
the
vine
of
SodomAnd
from
the
terraces
of
Gomorrah
Their
grapes
are
grapes
of
poison
Their
clusters
are
bitter
33
Their
wine
is
the
venom
of
serpents
The
cruel
poison
of
cobras
34
Is
this
not
stored
up
with
me
Sealed
up
in
my
storehouse
35
Vengeance
is
mine
and
retribution
At
the
appointed
time
when
their
foot
slips
For
the
day
of
their
disaster
is
near
And
what
awaits
them
will
come
quickly
36
For
Jehovah
will
judge
his
people
And
he
will
feel
pity
for
his
servantsWhen
he
sees
that
their
strength
has
waned
And
that
only
the
helpless
and
weak
remain
37
Then
he
will
say
Where
are
their
gods
The
rock
in
whom
they
sought
refuge
38
Who
used
to
eat
the
fat
of
their
sacrifices
To
drink
the
wine
of
their
drink
offerings
Let
them
rise
up
and
help
you
Let
them
become
your
place
of
refuge
39
See
now
that
I—I
am
he
And
there
are
no
gods
apart
from
me
I
put
to
death
and
I
make
alive
I
wound
and
I
will
heal
And
no
one
can
rescue
from
my
hand
40
For
I
raise
my
hand
to
heaven
And
I
swear
As
surely
as
I
live
forever

41
If
I
sharpen
my
flashing
swordAnd
prepare
my
hand
for
judgment
I
will
pay
back
vengeance
on
my
adversariesAnd
bring
retribution
to
those
who
hate
me
42
I
will
make
my
arrows
drunk
with
blood
And
my
sword
will
eat
flesh
With
the
blood
of
the
slain
and
the
captives
With
the
heads
of
the
leaders
of
the
enemy
43
Be
glad
you
nations
with
his
people
For
he
will
avenge
the
blood
of
his
servants
And
he
will
repay
vengeance
to
his
adversariesAnd
will
make
atonement
for
the
land
of
his
people
44
Thus
Moses
came
and
recited
all
the
words
of
this
song
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
he
and
Hoshea
the
son
of
Nun
45
After
Moses
finished
speaking
all
these
words
to
all
Israel
46
he
said
to
them
Take
to
heart
all
the
words
of
my
warning
to
you
today
so
that
you
may
command
your
sons
to
take
care
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
Law
47
For
this
is
no
empty
word
for
you
but
it
means
your
life
and
by
this
word
you
may
live
long
in
the
land
that
you
are
crossing
the
Jordan
to
possess
48
Jehovah
spoke
to
Moses
on
this
same
day
saying
49
Go
up
into
this
mountain
of
Abarim
Mount
Nebo
which
is
in
the
land
of
Moab
which
faces
toward
Jericho
and
view
the
land
of
Canaan
which
I
am
giving
to
the
Israelites
as
a
possession
50
Then
you
will
die
on
the
mountain
you
are
about
to
ascend
and
be
gathered
to
your
people
just
as
Aaron
your
brother
died
on
Mount
Hor
and
was
gathered
to
his
people
51
because
both
of
you
were
unfaithful
to
me
among
the
Israelites
at
the
waters
of
Meribah
of
Kadesh
in
the
wilderness
of
Zin
because
you
did
not
sanctify
me
before
the
people
of
Israel
52
You
will
see
the
land
from
a
distance
but
you
will
not
enter
the
land
that
I
am
giving
to
the
people
of
Israel
1
Now
this
is
the
blessing
that
Moses
the
man
of
the
true
God
pronounced
on
the
Israelites
before
his
death
2
He
said
Jehovah—from
Sinai
he
came
And
he
shone
upon
them
from
Seir
He
shone
forth
in
glory
from
the
mountainous
region
of
Paran
And
with
him
were
holy
myriads
At
his
right
hand
his
warriors

3
He
had
affection
for
his
people
All
their
holy
ones
are
in
your
hand
They
were
sitting
at
your
feet
They
began
to
listen
to
your
words

4
Moses
gave
us
a
command
a
law
As
a
possession
of
the
congregation
of
Jacob

5
And
He
became
king
in
Jeshurun
When
the
heads
of
the
people
gathered
together
Along
with
all
the
tribes
of
Israel

6
Let
Reuben
live
and
not
die
off
And
may
his
men
not
become
few

7
And
he
pronounced
this
blessing
on
Judah
Hear
O
Jehovah
the
voice
of
Judah
And
may
you
bring
him
back
to
his
people
His
arms
have
defended
what
belongs
to
him
And
may
you
help
him
against
his
adversaries

8
Of
Levi
he
said
Your
Thummim
and
your
Urim
belong
to
the
man
loyal
to
you
Whom
you
put
to
the
test
at
Massah
You
began
to
contend
with
him
by
the
waters
of
Meribah
9
The
man
who
said
to
his
father
and
his
mother
I
have
not
shown
regard
to
them
Even
his
brothers
he
did
not
acknowledge
And
he
ignored
his
own
sons
For
they
kept
your
word
And
they
observed
your
covenant
10
Let
them
instruct
Jacob
in
your
judicial
decisionsAnd
Israel
in
your
Law
Let
them
offer
up
incense
as
a
pleasant
aroma
for
youAnd
a
whole
offering
on
your
altar
11
Bless
O
Jehovah
his
strength
And
may
you
show
pleasure
in
the
work
of
his
hands
Crush
the
legs
of
those
who
rise
up
against
him
So
that
those
who
hate
him
may
rise
up
no
more
12
Of
Benjamin
he
said
Let
the
beloved
one
of
Jehovah
reside
in
security
by
him
While
he
shelters
him
the
whole
day
He
will
reside
between
his
shoulders
13
Of
Joseph
he
said
May
his
land
be
blessed
by
JehovahWith
the
choice
things
of
heaven
With
dew
and
the
waters
from
the
springs
below
14
With
choice
things
produced
by
the
sunAnd
the
choice
yield
each
month
15
With
the
choicest
things
from
the
ancient
mountainsAnd
choice
things
of
the
enduring
hills
16
With
the
choice
things
of
the
earth
and
what
fills
it
And
with
the
approval
of
the
One
residing
in
the
thornbush
May
they
come
upon
the
head
of
Joseph
On
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
one
singled
out
from
his
brothers
17
His
splendor
is
like
that
of
a
firstborn
bull
And
his
horns
are
the
horns
of
a
wild
bull
With
them
he
will
push
peoplesAll
together
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
They
are
the
tens
of
thousands
of
Ephraim
And
they
are
the
thousands
of
Manasseh
18
Of
Zebulun
he
said
Rejoice
O
Zebulun
in
your
going
out
And
you
Issachar
in
your
tents
19
They
will
call
peoples
to
the
mountain
There
they
will
offer
the
sacrifices
of
righteousness
For
they
will
draw
from
the
abundant
wealth
of
the
seasAnd
the
hidden
hoards
of
the
sand
20
Of
Gad
he
said
Blessed
is
the
one
widening
the
borders
of
Gad
He
lies
there
like
a
lion
Ready
to
tear
off
the
arm
yes
the
crown
of
the
head
21
He
will
select
the
first
portion
for
himself
For
there
the
allotment
of
a
lawgiver
is
reserved
The
heads
of
the
people
will
gather
together
The
righteousness
of
Jehovah
he
will
execute
And
his
judicial
decisions
with
Israel
22
Of
Dan
he
said
Dan
is
a
lion
cub
He
will
leap
out
from
Bashan
23
Of
Naphtali
he
said
Naphtali
is
satisfied
with
the
approvalAnd
full
of
the
blessing
of
Jehovah
Take
possession
of
the
west
and
south
24
Of
Asher
he
said
Blessed
with
sons
is
Asher
May
he
be
favored
by
his
brothers
And
may
he
dip
his
feet
in
oil
25
Iron
and
copper
are
your
gate
locks
And
you
will
be
secure
all
your
days
26
There
is
none
like
the
true
God
of
Jeshurun
Who
rides
through
heaven
to
help
youAnd
who
rides
upon
the
clouds
in
his
majesty
27
God
is
a
refuge
from
ancient
times
His
everlasting
arms
are
beneath
you
And
he
will
drive
away
the
enemy
from
before
you
And
he
will
say
Annihilate
them
28
Israel
will
reside
in
security
And
the
fountain
of
Jacob
will
be
secludedIn
a
land
of
grain
and
new
wine
Whose
skies
will
drip
with
dew
29
Happy
you
are
O
Israel
Who
is
there
like
you
A
people
enjoying
salvation
in
Jehovah
Your
protective
shieldAnd
your
majestic
sword
Your
enemies
will
cringe
before
you
And
you
will
tread
on
their
backs
1
Then
Moses
went
up
from
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
to
Mount
Nebo
to
the
top
of
Pisgah
which
faces
Jericho
And
Jehovah
showed
him
all
the
land
from
Gilead
to
Dan
2
and
all
Naphtali
and
the
land
of
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
and
all
the
land
of
Judah
as
far
as
the
western
sea
3
and
the
Negeb
and
the
District
the
valley
plain
of
Jericho
the
city
of
the
palm
trees
as
far
as
Zoar
4
Jehovah
then
said
to
him
This
is
the
land
about
which
I
have
sworn
to
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
saying
To
your
offspring
I
will
give
it
I
have
let
you
see
it
with
your
own
eyes
but
you
will
not
cross
over
there
5
After
that
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
died
there
in
the
land
of
Moab
just
as
Jehovah
had
said
6
He
buried
him
in
the
valley
in
the
land
of
Moab
opposite
Beth-peor
and
nobody
knows
where
his
grave
is
down
to
this
day
7
Moses
was
120
years
old
at
his
death
His
eyes
had
not
grown
dim
and
his
strength
had
not
departed
8
The
people
of
Israel
wept
for
Moses
on
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
for
30
days
Then
the
days
of
weeping
and
mourning
for
Moses
were
completed
9
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
was
full
of
the
spirit
of
wisdom
for
Moses
had
laid
his
hand
on
him
and
the
Israelites
began
to
listen
to
him
and
they
did
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
10
But
there
has
never
again
arisen
a
prophet
in
Israel
like
Moses
whom
Jehovah
knew
face-to-face
11
He
performed
all
the
signs
and
the
miracles
that
Jehovah
had
sent
him
to
do
in
the
land
of
Egypt
to
Pharaoh
and
all
his
servants
and
all
his
land
12
along
with
the
mighty
hand
and
the
awesome
power
that
Moses
displayed
before
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
1
After
the
death
of
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
Jehovah
said
to
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
the
minister
of
Moses
2
Moses
my
servant
is
dead
Now
get
up
cross
the
Jordan
you
and
all
this
people
and
go
into
the
land
that
I
am
giving
to
them
to
the
people
of
Israel
3
I
will
give
you
every
place
on
which
you
set
your
foot
just
as
I
promised
Moses
4
Your
territory
will
extend
from
the
wilderness
up
to
Lebanon
and
to
the
great
river
the
Euphrates—all
the
land
of
the
Hittites—and
to
the
Great
Sea
on
the
west
5
No
one
will
be
able
to
take
a
stand
against
you
as
long
as
you
live
Just
as
I
was
with
Moses
so
I
will
be
with
you
I
will
neither
desert
you
nor
abandon
you
6
Be
courageous
and
strong
for
you
are
the
one
who
will
cause
this
people
to
inherit
the
land
that
I
swore
to
their
forefathers
I
would
give
to
them
7
Only
be
courageous
and
very
strong
and
observe
carefully
the
entire
Law
that
Moses
my
servant
commanded
you
Do
not
deviate
from
it
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
so
that
you
may
act
wisely
wherever
you
go
8
This
book
of
the
Law
should
not
depart
from
your
mouth
and
you
must
read
it
in
an
undertone
day
and
night
in
order
to
observe
carefully
all
that
is
written
in
it
for
then
your
way
will
be
successful
and
then
you
will
act
wisely
9
Have
I
not
commanded
you
Be
courageous
and
strong
Do
not
be
struck
with
terror
or
fear
for
Jehovah
your
God
is
with
you
wherever
you
go
10
Then
Joshua
commanded
the
officers
of
the
people
11
Pass
throughout
the
camp
and
give
this
command
to
the
people
Get
provisions
ready
because
in
three
days
you
will
cross
the
Jordan
to
go
in
and
take
possession
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
to
possess
12
And
to
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
Joshua
said
13
Remember
what
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
commanded
you
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
you
rest
and
has
given
you
this
land
14
Your
wives
your
children
and
your
livestock
will
dwell
in
the
land
that
Moses
has
given
you
on
this
side
of
the
Jordan
but
all
you
mighty
warriors
should
cross
over
in
battle
formation
ahead
of
your
brothers
You
must
help
them
15
until
Jehovah
gives
your
brothers
rest
just
as
he
has
given
you
and
they
also
take
possession
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
is
giving
them
Then
return
to
the
land
you
were
given
to
occupy
and
take
possession
of
it
the
land
that
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
gave
you
on
the
east
side
of
the
Jordan
16
They
answered
Joshua
We
will
do
all
that
you
have
commanded
and
we
will
go
wherever
you
send
us
17
Just
as
we
listened
to
everything
Moses
said
so
we
will
listen
to
you
Only
may
Jehovah
your
God
be
with
you
just
as
he
was
with
Moses
18
Any
man
who
rebels
against
your
order
and
does
not
obey
every
command
you
give
him
will
be
put
to
death
Only
be
courageous
and
strong
1
Then
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
secretly
sent
two
men
out
from
Shittim
as
spies
He
told
them
Go
and
inspect
the
land
especially
Jericho
So
they
went
and
came
to
the
house
of
a
prostitute
named
Rahab
and
they
stayed
there
2
The
king
of
Jericho
was
told
Look
Israelite
men
have
come
in
here
tonight
to
spy
out
the
land
3
At
that
the
king
of
Jericho
sent
word
to
Rahab
Bring
out
the
men
who
came
and
are
staying
in
your
house
for
they
have
come
to
spy
out
the
entire
land
4
But
the
woman
took
the
two
men
and
hid
them
Then
she
said
Yes
the
men
came
to
me
but
I
did
not
know
where
they
were
from
5
And
at
dark
when
the
city
gate
was
about
to
be
closed
the
men
went
out
I
do
not
know
where
the
men
went
but
if
you
quickly
chase
after
them
you
will
catch
up
with
them
6
However
she
had
taken
them
up
to
the
roof
and
hidden
them
among
stalks
of
flax
laid
in
rows
on
the
roof
7
So
the
men
chased
after
them
in
the
direction
of
the
Jordan
at
the
fords
and
the
city
gate
was
shut
once
the
pursuers
had
gone
out
8
Before
the
men
lay
down
to
sleep
she
came
up
to
them
on
the
roof
9
She
said
to
the
men
I
do
know
that
Jehovah
will
give
you
the
land
and
that
the
fear
of
you
has
fallen
upon
us
All
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
are
disheartened
because
of
you
10
for
we
heard
how
Jehovah
dried
up
the
waters
of
the
Red
Sea
before
you
when
you
left
Egypt
and
what
you
did
to
the
two
kings
of
the
Amorites
Sihon
and
Og
whom
you
devoted
to
destruction
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
11
When
we
heard
about
it
we
lost
heart
and
no
one
has
any
courage
because
of
you
for
Jehovah
your
God
is
God
in
the
heavens
above
and
on
the
earth
beneath
12
Now
please
swear
to
me
by
Jehovah
that
because
I
showed
loyal
love
to
you
you
will
also
show
loyal
love
to
my
fathers
household
and
you
must
give
me
a
sign
of
good
faith
13
You
must
spare
the
lives
of
my
father
and
mother
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
all
who
belong
to
them
and
you
must
save
us
from
death
14
At
that
the
men
said
to
her
We
will
give
our
lives
for
yours
If
you
do
not
tell
about
our
mission
then
we
will
show
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
toward
you
when
Jehovah
gives
us
the
land
15
After
that
she
let
them
down
by
a
rope
through
the
window
for
her
house
was
on
a
side
of
the
city
wall
In
fact
she
was
dwelling
on
the
wall
16
Then
she
said
to
them
Go
to
the
mountainous
region
and
hide
there
for
three
days
so
that
those
pursuing
you
may
not
find
you
Then
after
your
pursuers
have
come
back
you
can
go
on
your
way
17
The
men
said
to
her
We
will
be
free
from
guilt
respecting
this
oath
that
you
made
us
swear
18
unless
when
we
come
into
the
land
you
tie
this
cord
of
scarlet
thread
in
the
window
by
which
you
let
us
down
You
should
gather
your
father
your
mother
your
brothers
and
all
your
fathers
household
with
you
into
the
house
19
Then
if
anyone
goes
out
the
doors
of
your
house
into
the
open
his
blood
will
be
on
his
own
head
and
we
will
be
free
from
guilt
But
if
harm
comes
to
anyone
who
remains
with
you
in
the
house
his
blood
will
be
on
our
heads
20
But
if
you
report
our
mission
we
will
be
free
from
guilt
respecting
your
oath
that
you
made
us
swear
21
She
replied
Let
it
be
according
to
your
words
With
that
she
sent
them
off
and
they
went
their
way
Afterward
she
tied
the
scarlet
cord
in
the
window
22
So
they
left
and
went
to
the
mountainous
region
and
stayed
there
for
three
days
until
the
pursuers
returned
The
pursuers
had
been
looking
for
them
on
every
road
but
did
not
find
them
23
The
two
men
then
descended
from
the
mountainous
region
and
crossed
the
river
and
came
to
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
They
related
to
him
all
the
things
that
had
happened
to
them
24
Then
they
said
to
Joshua
Jehovah
has
handed
over
the
entire
land
to
us
In
fact
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
are
disheartened
because
of
us
1
Then
Joshua
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
he
and
all
the
Israelites
departed
from
Shittim
and
came
to
the
Jordan
They
spent
the
night
there
before
crossing
over
2
After
three
days
the
officers
passed
throughout
the
camp
3
and
commanded
the
people
As
soon
as
you
see
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
your
God
being
carried
by
the
Levitical
priests
you
should
depart
from
your
place
and
follow
it
4
But
keep
a
distance
of
about
2000
cubits
from
it
do
not
come
any
nearer
to
it
so
that
you
may
know
which
is
the
way
to
go
for
you
have
not
traveled
on
this
way
before
5
Joshua
now
said
to
the
people
Sanctify
yourselves
for
tomorrow
Jehovah
will
do
wonderful
things
among
you
6
Then
Joshua
said
to
the
priests
Take
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
pass
ahead
of
the
people
So
they
took
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
went
ahead
of
the
people
7
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Joshua
This
day
I
will
start
to
exalt
you
in
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
so
that
they
may
know
that
I
will
be
with
you
just
as
I
was
with
Moses
8
You
should
give
this
command
to
the
priests
carrying
the
ark
of
the
covenant
When
you
reach
the
edge
of
the
waters
of
the
Jordan
you
should
stand
still
in
the
Jordan
9
And
Joshua
said
to
the
Israelites
Come
here
and
listen
to
the
words
of
Jehovah
your
God
10
Joshua
then
said
By
this
you
will
know
that
a
living
God
is
among
you
and
that
he
will
without
fail
drive
away
from
before
you
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Hivites
the
Perizzites
the
Girgashites
the
Amorites
and
the
Jebusites
11
Look
The
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
Lord
of
the
whole
earth
is
passing
ahead
of
you
into
the
Jordan
12
Now
take
12
men
from
the
tribes
of
Israel
one
man
for
each
tribe
13
and
as
soon
as
the
soles
of
the
feet
of
the
priests
carrying
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
the
Lord
of
the
whole
earth
touch
the
waters
of
the
Jordan
the
waters
of
the
Jordan
flowing
from
upstream
will
be
halted
and
they
will
stand
still
like
a
dam
14
So
when
the
people
departed
from
their
tents
just
before
crossing
the
Jordan
the
priests
carrying
the
ark
of
the
covenant
went
ahead
of
the
people
15
As
soon
as
the
carriers
of
the
Ark
reached
the
Jordan
and
the
priests
carrying
the
Ark
dipped
their
feet
into
the
edge
of
the
waters
now
the
Jordan
overflows
its
banks
all
the
days
of
harvest
16
the
waters
flowing
from
upstream
stood
still
They
rose
up
like
a
dam
very
far
away
at
Adam
the
city
near
Zarethan
while
the
waters
descending
toward
the
Sea
of
the
Arabah
the
Salt
Sea
drained
away
They
were
halted
and
the
people
crossed
over
opposite
Jericho
17
While
the
priests
carrying
the
ark
of
Jehovahs
covenant
kept
standing
still
on
dry
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
Jordan
all
Israel
crossed
over
on
dry
ground
until
the
whole
nation
had
finished
crossing
the
Jordan
1
As
soon
as
the
whole
nation
had
finished
crossing
the
Jordan
Jehovah
said
to
Joshua
2
Take
12
men
from
the
people
one
man
from
each
tribe
3
and
give
them
this
command
Take
up
12
stones
from
the
middle
of
the
Jordan
from
the
place
where
the
priests
feet
stood
still
and
carry
them
over
with
you
and
set
them
down
in
the
place
where
you
will
spend
the
night
4
So
Joshua
called
the
12
men
whom
he
had
appointed
from
the
Israelites
one
man
from
each
tribe
5
and
Joshua
said
to
them
Pass
ahead
of
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
your
God
to
the
middle
of
the
Jordan
and
each
of
you
should
lift
up
a
stone
on
his
shoulder
according
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
the
Israelites
6
to
serve
as
a
sign
among
you
If
your
children
should
later
ask
you
Why
do
you
have
these
stones
7
you
must
tell
them
Because
the
waters
of
the
Jordan
were
halted
from
before
the
ark
of
Jehovahs
covenant
When
it
crossed
the
Jordan
the
waters
of
the
Jordan
were
halted
These
stones
will
serve
as
a
lasting
memorial
to
the
people
of
Israel
8
So
the
Israelites
did
just
as
Joshua
had
commanded
They
took
up
12
stones
from
the
middle
of
the
Jordan
just
as
Jehovah
had
instructed
Joshua
to
correspond
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
the
Israelites
They
took
them
over
to
the
place
where
they
would
spend
the
night
and
set
them
down
there
9
Joshua
also
set
up
12
stones
in
the
middle
of
the
Jordan
at
the
place
where
the
feet
of
the
priests
who
carried
the
ark
of
the
covenant
stood
and
the
stones
are
there
to
this
day
10
The
priests
carrying
the
Ark
remained
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
Jordan
until
everything
that
Jehovah
had
ordered
Joshua
to
tell
the
people
to
do
was
completed
in
harmony
with
all
that
Moses
had
commanded
Joshua
All
the
while
the
people
hurried
across
11
As
soon
as
all
the
people
had
finished
crossing
over
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
and
the
priests
crossed
over
in
the
sight
of
the
people
12
And
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
crossed
over
in
battle
formation
ahead
of
the
other
Israelites
just
as
Moses
had
instructed
them
13
About
40000
soldiers
armed
for
battle
crossed
over
before
Jehovah
onto
the
desert
plains
of
Jericho
14
On
that
day
Jehovah
exalted
Joshua
in
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
and
they
deeply
respected
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
just
as
they
had
deeply
respected
Moses
15
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Joshua
16
Command
the
priests
carrying
the
ark
of
the
Testimony
to
come
up
out
of
the
Jordan
17
So
Joshua
commanded
the
priests
Come
up
out
of
the
Jordan
18
When
the
priests
carrying
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
came
up
from
the
middle
of
the
Jordan
and
the
soles
of
the
feet
of
the
priests
stepped
onto
dry
ground
the
waters
of
the
Jordan
resumed
their
course
and
overflowed
the
banks
as
before
19
The
people
came
up
from
the
Jordan
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
first
month
and
camped
at
Gilgal
on
the
eastern
border
of
Jericho
20
As
for
the
12
stones
that
they
had
taken
out
of
the
Jordan
Joshua
set
these
up
at
Gilgal
21
Then
he
said
to
the
Israelites
In
the
future
when
your
children
ask
their
fathers
What
do
these
stones
mean
22
you
must
explain
to
your
children
Israel
crossed
the
Jordan
on
dry
land
23
when
Jehovah
your
God
dried
up
the
waters
of
the
Jordan
before
them
until
they
had
crossed
it
just
as
Jehovah
your
God
did
to
the
Red
Sea
when
he
dried
it
up
before
us
until
we
crossed
it
24
He
did
this
so
that
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
may
know
how
mighty
Jehovahs
hand
is
and
so
that
you
may
always
fear
Jehovah
your
God
1
As
soon
as
all
the
kings
of
the
Amorites
who
were
on
the
west
side
of
the
Jordan
and
all
the
kings
of
the
Canaanites
who
were
by
the
sea
heard
that
Jehovah
had
dried
up
the
waters
of
the
Jordan
before
the
Israelites
until
they
had
crossed
over
they
lost
heart
and
they
lost
all
courage
because
of
the
Israelites
2
At
that
time
Jehovah
said
to
Joshua
Make
for
yourself
flint
knives
and
circumcise
the
men
of
Israel
again
a
second
time
3
So
Joshua
made
flint
knives
and
circumcised
the
men
of
Israel
at
Gibeath-haaraloth
4
This
is
why
Joshua
circumcised
them
All
the
males
of
the
people
who
left
Egypt
all
the
men
of
war
had
died
in
the
wilderness
on
the
journey
after
they
left
Egypt
5
All
the
people
who
left
Egypt
were
circumcised
but
all
the
people
born
in
the
wilderness
on
the
journey
after
they
left
Egypt
were
not
circumcised
6
The
Israelites
had
walked
for
40
years
in
the
wilderness
until
the
entire
nation
had
died
off
that
is
the
men
of
war
who
left
Egypt
who
did
not
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
Jehovah
swore
to
them
that
he
would
never
let
them
see
the
land
that
Jehovah
had
sworn
to
their
forefathers
to
give
to
us
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
7
So
he
raised
up
their
sons
instead
of
them
These
Joshua
circumcised
they
were
uncircumcised
because
they
had
not
circumcised
them
during
the
journey
8
When
they
finished
circumcising
the
entire
nation
they
remained
where
they
were
in
the
camp
until
they
recovered
9
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Joshua
Today
I
have
rolled
away
from
you
the
reproach
of
Egypt
So
that
place
has
been
called
Gilgal
until
this
day
10
The
Israelites
continued
to
camp
at
Gilgal
and
they
observed
the
Passover
on
the
14th
day
of
the
month
in
the
evening
on
the
desert
plains
of
Jericho
11
And
they
began
to
eat
the
produce
of
the
land
the
day
after
the
Passover
unleavened
bread
and
roasted
grains
on
this
same
day
12
Then
the
manna
stopped
on
the
day
following
when
they
had
eaten
some
of
the
produce
of
the
land
there
was
no
longer
manna
for
the
Israelites
but
they
began
to
eat
the
produce
of
the
land
of
Canaan
in
that
year
13
When
Joshua
was
near
Jericho
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
man
standing
in
front
of
him
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
Joshua
walked
up
to
him
and
asked
Are
you
on
our
side
or
on
the
side
of
our
adversaries
14
To
this
he
said
No
but
I
have
come
as
prince
of
Jehovahs
army
With
that
Joshua
fell
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
prostrated
himself
and
said
to
him
What
does
my
lord
have
to
say
to
his
servant
15
The
prince
of
Jehovahs
army
replied
to
Joshua
Remove
your
sandals
from
your
feet
because
the
place
where
you
are
standing
is
holy
At
once
Joshua
did
so
1
Now
Jericho
was
tightly
shut
up
because
of
the
Israelites
no
one
was
leaving
and
no
one
was
entering
2
Jehovah
then
said
to
Joshua
See
I
have
handed
over
to
you
Jericho
and
its
king
and
its
mighty
warriors
3
All
you
fighting
men
should
march
around
the
city
going
around
the
city
once
That
is
what
you
should
do
for
six
days
4
Have
seven
priests
carry
seven
rams
horns
before
the
Ark
But
on
the
seventh
day
you
should
march
around
the
city
seven
times
and
the
priests
should
blow
the
horns
5
When
the
rams
horn
is
sounded—as
soon
as
you
hear
the
sound
of
the
horn—all
the
people
should
shout
a
great
war
cry
Then
the
wall
of
the
city
will
fall
down
flat
and
the
people
must
go
up
each
one
straight
ahead
6
So
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
called
the
priests
together
and
told
them
Take
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
and
seven
priests
should
carry
seven
rams
horns
before
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
7
Then
he
told
the
people
Move
on
and
march
around
the
city
and
the
armed
troops
should
go
ahead
of
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
8
And
just
as
Joshua
had
spoken
to
the
people
the
seven
priests
carrying
seven
rams
horns
before
Jehovah
went
forward
and
blew
the
horns
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
was
following
them
9
And
the
armed
troops
went
ahead
of
the
priests
who
were
blowing
the
horns
and
the
rear
guard
followed
the
Ark
as
the
horns
were
blown
continuously
10
Now
Joshua
had
commanded
the
people
Do
not
shout
nor
let
your
voices
be
heard
Not
a
word
should
come
out
of
your
mouths
until
the
day
I
say
to
you
Shout
Then
shout
11
He
had
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
go
around
the
city
going
around
it
once
after
which
they
returned
to
the
camp
and
spent
the
night
there
12
The
next
morning
Joshua
got
up
early
and
the
priests
took
up
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
13
and
seven
priests
carrying
seven
rams
horns
walked
before
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
continuously
blowing
the
horns
The
armed
troops
were
walking
ahead
of
them
while
the
rear
guard
was
following
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
as
the
horns
were
blown
continuously
14
They
marched
around
the
city
on
the
second
day
once
after
which
they
returned
to
the
camp
That
was
what
they
did
for
six
days
15
On
the
seventh
day
they
got
up
early
as
soon
as
the
dawn
broke
and
they
marched
around
the
city
in
the
same
manner
seven
times
It
was
only
on
that
day
that
they
marched
around
the
city
seven
times
16
And
on
the
seventh
time
the
priests
blew
the
horns
and
Joshua
told
the
people
Shout
for
Jehovah
has
given
you
the
city
17
The
city
and
everything
in
it
is
to
be
devoted
to
destruction
it
all
belongs
to
Jehovah
Only
Rahab
the
prostitute
may
keep
living
she
and
all
who
are
with
her
in
the
house
because
she
hid
the
messengers
we
sent
out
18
But
keep
away
from
what
is
devoted
to
destruction
so
that
you
do
not
desire
something
devoted
to
destruction
and
take
it
making
the
camp
of
Israel
something
devoted
to
destruction
by
bringing
disaster
on
it
19
But
all
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
articles
of
copper
and
iron
are
holy
to
Jehovah
They
should
go
into
the
treasury
of
Jehovah
20
Then
the
people
shouted
when
the
horns
were
blown
As
soon
as
the
people
heard
the
sound
of
the
horn
and
shouted
a
great
war
cry
the
wall
fell
down
flat
After
that
the
people
went
up
into
the
city
each
one
straight
ahead
and
they
captured
the
city
21
They
devoted
all
that
was
in
the
city
to
destruction
by
the
sword
man
and
woman
young
and
old
bull
sheep
and
donkey
22
Joshua
said
to
the
two
men
who
had
spied
out
the
land
Go
into
the
house
of
the
prostitute
and
bring
out
the
woman
and
all
who
belong
to
her
just
as
you
swore
to
her
23
So
the
young
spies
went
in
and
brought
out
Rahab
along
with
her
father
her
mother
her
brothers
and
all
who
belonged
to
her
yes
they
brought
out
her
whole
family
and
they
brought
them
safely
to
a
place
outside
the
camp
of
Israel
24
Then
they
burned
the
city
and
everything
in
it
with
fire
But
the
silver
the
gold
and
the
articles
of
copper
and
iron
they
gave
to
the
treasury
of
Jehovahs
house
25
Only
Rahab
the
prostitute
and
her
fathers
household
and
all
who
belonged
to
her
were
spared
by
Joshua
and
she
lives
in
Israel
to
this
day
because
she
hid
the
messengers
whom
Joshua
sent
out
to
spy
on
Jericho
26
At
that
time
Joshua
pronounced
this
oath
Cursed
be
the
man
before
Jehovah
who
undertakes
to
rebuild
this
city
of
Jericho
At
the
cost
of
his
firstborn
he
will
lay
its
foundation
and
at
the
cost
of
his
youngest
he
will
put
up
its
doors
27
So
Jehovah
was
with
Joshua
and
his
fame
spread
through
all
the
earth
1
But
the
Israelites
were
unfaithful
with
regard
to
what
had
been
devoted
to
destruction
for
Achan
son
of
Carmi
son
of
Zabdi
son
of
Zerah
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
took
some
of
what
was
devoted
to
destruction
At
this
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
the
Israelites
2
Then
Joshua
sent
men
out
from
Jericho
to
Ai
which
is
close
by
Beth-aven
and
east
of
Bethel
telling
them
Go
up
and
spy
on
the
land
So
the
men
went
up
and
spied
on
Ai
3
When
they
returned
to
Joshua
they
told
him
Not
all
the
people
need
to
go
up
About
two
or
three
thousand
men
are
enough
to
defeat
Ai
Do
not
tire
out
all
the
people
by
making
them
go
for
there
are
only
a
few
of
them
4
So
about
3000
men
went
up
there
but
they
had
to
flee
from
the
men
of
Ai
5
The
men
of
Ai
struck
down
36
men
and
they
pursued
them
from
outside
the
city
gate
as
far
as
Shebarim
and
they
continued
striking
them
down
on
the
descent
So
the
courage
of
the
people
melted
and
flowed
away
like
water
6
At
this
Joshua
ripped
his
garments
and
fell
with
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
until
the
evening
he
and
the
elders
of
Israel
and
they
kept
throwing
dust
on
their
heads
7
Joshua
said
Alas
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
why
did
you
bring
this
people
all
the
way
across
the
Jordan
just
to
hand
us
over
to
the
Amorites
to
be
destroyed
If
only
we
had
been
satisfied
to
remain
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
8
Pardon
me
O
Jehovah
what
can
I
say
now
that
Israel
has
retreated
before
his
enemies
9
When
the
Canaanites
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
hear
about
it
they
will
surround
us
and
wipe
out
our
very
name
from
the
earth
and
what
will
you
do
about
your
great
name
10
Jehovah
replied
to
Joshua
Get
up
Why
are
you
lying
on
your
face
11
Israel
has
sinned
They
have
violated
my
covenant
that
I
commanded
them
to
keep
They
took
some
of
what
was
devoted
to
destruction
stealing
it
and
secretly
putting
it
among
their
own
possessions
12
Therefore
the
Israelites
will
not
be
able
to
stand
against
their
enemies
They
will
turn
their
backs
and
flee
from
their
enemies
because
they
have
become
something
devoted
to
destruction
I
will
not
be
with
you
again
unless
you
annihilate
from
your
midst
what
was
devoted
to
destruction
13
Get
up
and
sanctify
the
people
Tell
them
Sanctify
yourselves
tomorrow
for
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
What
is
devoted
to
destruction
is
among
you
O
Israel
You
will
not
be
able
to
stand
against
your
enemies
until
you
remove
from
your
midst
the
thing
devoted
to
destruction
14
You
are
to
present
yourselves
in
the
morning
tribe
by
tribe
and
the
tribe
that
Jehovah
selects
will
come
near
family
by
family
and
the
family
that
Jehovah
selects
will
come
near
household
by
household
and
the
household
that
Jehovah
selects
will
come
near
man
by
man
15
And
the
one
who
is
caught
with
the
thing
devoted
to
destruction
will
be
burned
with
fire
he
and
all
that
belongs
to
him
because
he
has
violated
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
and
because
he
has
committed
a
disgraceful
act
in
Israel
16
So
Joshua
rose
early
the
next
morning
and
had
Israel
come
near
tribe
by
tribe
and
the
tribe
of
Judah
was
selected
17
He
had
the
families
of
Judah
come
near
and
the
family
of
the
Zerahites
was
selected
after
which
he
had
the
family
of
the
Zerahites
come
near
man
by
man
and
Zabdi
was
selected
18
Finally
he
had
the
household
of
Zabdi
come
near
man
by
man
and
Achan
son
of
Carmi
son
of
Zabdi
son
of
Zerah
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
was
selected
19
Then
Joshua
said
to
Achan
My
son
please
honor
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
and
make
confession
to
him
Tell
me
please
what
you
have
done
Do
not
hide
it
from
me
20
Achan
answered
Joshua
For
a
fact
I
am
the
one
who
sinned
against
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
and
this
is
what
I
have
done
21
When
I
saw
among
the
spoil
a
good-looking
official
garment
from
Shinar
and
200
shekels
of
silver
and
one
gold
bar
weighing
50
shekels
I
desired
them
so
I
took
them
They
are
now
hidden
in
the
ground
inside
my
tent
with
the
money
underneath
22
At
once
Joshua
sent
messengers
and
they
ran
to
the
tent
and
there
the
garment
was
hidden
in
his
tent
with
the
money
underneath
it
23
So
they
took
the
things
out
of
the
tent
and
brought
them
to
Joshua
and
all
the
Israelites
and
placed
them
before
Jehovah
24
Joshua
and
all
Israel
with
him
then
took
Achan
the
son
of
Zerah
the
silver
the
official
garment
and
the
bar
of
gold
along
with
his
sons
his
daughters
his
bull
his
donkey
his
flock
his
tent
and
everything
that
was
his
and
they
brought
them
up
to
the
Valley
of
Achor
25
Joshua
said
Why
have
you
brought
disaster
upon
us
Jehovah
will
bring
disaster
upon
you
on
this
day
With
that
all
Israel
stoned
him
after
which
they
burned
them
with
fire
Thus
they
stoned
all
of
them
26
And
they
raised
a
huge
pile
of
stones
over
him
that
remains
to
this
day
At
this
Jehovahs
hot
anger
subsided
That
is
why
the
name
of
that
place
is
Valley
of
Achor
to
this
day
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Joshua
Do
not
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
Take
with
you
all
the
fighting
men
and
go
up
against
Ai
See
I
have
handed
over
to
you
the
king
of
Ai
his
people
his
city
and
his
land
2
Do
to
Ai
and
to
its
king
just
as
you
did
to
Jericho
and
its
king
except
you
may
plunder
its
spoil
and
its
livestock
for
yourselves
Set
an
ambush
behind
the
city
3
So
Joshua
and
all
the
fighting
men
went
up
against
Ai
Joshua
chose
30000
mighty
warriors
and
sent
them
off
by
night
4
He
gave
them
this
command
See
you
are
to
lie
in
ambush
behind
the
city
Do
not
go
very
far
from
the
city
and
all
of
you
be
ready
5
I
and
all
the
people
with
me
will
approach
the
city
and
when
they
come
out
against
us
as
before
we
will
retreat
from
them
6
When
they
come
out
after
us
we
will
draw
them
away
from
the
city
for
they
will
say
They
are
retreating
from
us
just
as
before
And
we
will
retreat
from
them
7
Then
you
should
rise
up
from
the
ambush
and
capture
the
city
Jehovah
your
God
will
hand
it
over
to
you
8
As
soon
as
you
have
seized
the
city
you
should
set
it
on
fire
You
should
do
according
to
Jehovahs
word
See
I
have
given
you
your
orders
9
Then
Joshua
sent
them
out
and
they
marched
to
the
place
of
ambush
they
took
a
position
between
Bethel
and
Ai
to
the
west
of
Ai
while
Joshua
spent
that
night
with
the
people
10
After
Joshua
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
and
gathered
the
troops
he
and
the
elders
of
Israel
led
them
to
Ai
11
All
the
fighting
men
who
were
with
him
marched
up
and
advanced
to
the
front
of
the
city
They
camped
to
the
north
of
Ai
with
the
valley
between
them
and
Ai
12
In
the
meantime
he
had
taken
about
5000
men
and
had
set
them
as
an
ambush
between
Bethel
and
Ai
to
the
west
of
the
city
13
So
the
people
set
the
main
camp
to
the
north
of
the
city
and
the
rear
guard
west
of
the
city
and
Joshua
went
that
night
into
the
middle
of
the
valley
14
And
as
soon
as
the
king
of
Ai
saw
this
he
and
the
men
of
the
city
hurried
out
early
in
the
morning
to
meet
Israel
in
battle
at
a
certain
place
overlooking
the
desert
plain
But
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
an
ambush
set
against
him
to
the
rear
of
the
city
15
When
the
men
of
Ai
attacked
Joshua
and
all
Israel
fled
along
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
wilderness
16
Then
all
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
were
summoned
to
pursue
them
and
as
they
pursued
Joshua
they
were
drawn
away
from
the
city
17
Not
a
man
was
remaining
in
Ai
and
Bethel
who
did
not
go
out
after
Israel
They
left
the
city
wide
open
and
pursued
Israel
18
Jehovah
now
said
to
Joshua
Stretch
out
the
javelin
that
is
in
your
hand
toward
Ai
for
into
your
hand
I
will
give
it
So
Joshua
stretched
out
the
javelin
that
was
in
his
hand
toward
the
city
19
The
moment
he
stretched
out
his
hand
the
ambush
rose
up
quickly
from
its
place
and
ran
into
the
city
and
captured
it
They
immediately
set
the
city
on
fire
20
When
the
men
of
Ai
turned
around
they
saw
the
smoke
of
the
city
rising
to
the
sky
and
they
had
no
strength
to
flee
in
any
direction
Then
the
people
who
had
been
fleeing
toward
the
wilderness
turned
on
their
pursuers
21
When
Joshua
and
all
Israel
saw
that
the
ambush
had
captured
the
city
and
saw
the
smoke
of
the
city
rising
they
turned
around
and
attacked
the
men
of
Ai
22
And
the
others
came
out
of
the
city
to
meet
them
so
that
the
men
of
Ai
were
trapped
in
the
middle
with
some
Israelites
on
this
side
and
some
on
that
side
and
they
struck
them
down
until
there
was
not
one
survivor
or
escapee
remaining
23
But
they
caught
the
king
of
Ai
alive
and
brought
him
before
Joshua
24
After
Israel
finished
killing
all
the
inhabitants
of
Ai
in
the
field
in
the
wilderness
where
they
had
pursued
them
and
every
last
one
of
them
had
fallen
by
the
sword
then
all
Israel
returned
to
Ai
and
struck
it
with
the
sword
25
All
those
who
fell
on
that
day
from
man
to
woman
amounted
to
12000
all
the
people
of
Ai
26
Joshua
did
not
draw
back
his
hand
with
which
he
had
stretched
out
the
javelin
until
he
had
devoted
all
the
inhabitants
of
Ai
to
destruction
27
However
Israel
took
the
livestock
and
the
spoil
of
that
city
for
themselves
according
to
the
orders
that
Jehovah
had
given
to
Joshua
28
Then
Joshua
burned
Ai
and
reduced
it
to
a
permanent
mound
of
ruins
as
it
remains
to
this
day
29
He
hung
the
king
of
Ai
on
a
stake
until
the
evening
and
as
the
sun
was
about
to
set
Joshua
gave
the
order
to
take
his
dead
body
down
from
the
stake
Then
they
pitched
it
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
gate
and
raised
up
a
great
pile
of
stones
over
him
which
is
there
to
this
day
30
It
was
then
that
Joshua
built
an
altar
on
Mount
Ebal
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
31
just
as
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
had
commanded
the
Israelites
and
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
Law
of
Moses
An
altar
of
whole
stones
on
which
no
iron
tool
has
been
wielded
On
it
they
offered
up
burnt
offerings
to
Jehovah
as
well
as
communion
sacrifices
32
Then
he
wrote
there
on
the
stones
a
copy
of
the
Law
that
Moses
had
written
before
the
Israelites
33
All
Israel
their
elders
the
officers
and
their
judges
were
standing
on
both
sides
of
the
Ark
in
front
of
the
Levitical
priests
who
were
carrying
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
The
foreign
residents
were
there
as
well
as
the
natives
Half
of
them
stood
in
front
of
Mount
Gerizim
and
the
other
half
in
front
of
Mount
Ebal
just
as
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
had
previously
commanded
to
bless
the
people
of
Israel
34
After
this
he
read
aloud
all
the
words
of
the
Law
the
blessings
and
the
curses
according
to
all
that
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
Law
35
There
was
not
a
word
of
all
that
Moses
had
commanded
that
Joshua
did
not
read
aloud
in
front
of
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
including
the
women
and
children
and
the
foreign
residents
who
were
living
among
them
1
When
all
the
kings
who
were
on
the
west
side
of
the
Jordan
heard
what
had
happened
those
in
the
mountainous
region
in
the
Shephelah
along
the
entire
coast
of
the
Great
Sea
and
in
front
of
Lebanon—the
Hittites
the
Amorites
the
Canaanites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites—
2
they
formed
an
alliance
to
fight
against
Joshua
and
Israel
3
The
inhabitants
of
Gibeon
also
heard
what
Joshua
had
done
to
Jericho
and
Ai
4
So
they
acted
shrewdly
and
put
provisions
into
worn-out
sacks
on
their
donkeys
along
with
worn-out
wineskins
that
had
burst
and
had
been
mended
5
they
also
had
worn-out
and
patched
sandals
on
their
feet
and
they
were
wearing
worn-out
garments
All
the
bread
of
their
provisions
was
dry
and
crumbly
6
Then
they
went
to
Joshua
at
the
camp
at
Gilgal
and
said
to
him
and
the
men
of
Israel
We
have
come
from
a
distant
land
Now
make
a
covenant
with
us
7
But
the
men
of
Israel
said
to
the
Hivites
Perhaps
you
are
living
near
us
So
how
can
we
make
a
covenant
with
you
8
They
replied
to
Joshua
We
are
your
servants
Then
Joshua
said
to
them
Who
are
you
and
where
do
you
come
from
9
At
this
they
said
to
him
Your
servants
have
come
from
a
very
distant
land
out
of
regard
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
your
God
because
we
have
heard
about
his
fame
and
about
all
he
did
in
Egypt
10
and
about
all
he
did
to
the
two
kings
of
the
Amorites
who
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
King
Sihon
of
Heshbon
and
King
Og
of
Bashan
who
was
in
Ashtaroth
11
So
our
elders
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
our
land
told
us
Take
provisions
with
you
for
the
journey
and
go
to
meet
them
Tell
them
We
will
be
your
servants
now
make
a
covenant
with
us
12
This
bread
that
we
took
as
our
provisions
was
still
hot
on
the
day
we
left
our
houses
to
come
here
to
you
Now
you
can
see
it
is
dry
and
crumbly
13
And
these
wineskins
were
new
when
we
filled
them
but
now
they
have
burst
And
our
garments
and
sandals
have
worn
out
because
of
the
great
length
of
the
journey
14
At
that
the
men
took
some
of
their
provisions
but
they
did
not
inquire
of
Jehovah
15
So
Joshua
made
peace
with
them
and
made
a
covenant
with
them
to
let
them
live
and
that
is
what
the
chieftains
of
the
assembly
swore
to
them
in
an
oath
16
At
the
end
of
three
days
after
they
made
a
covenant
with
them
they
heard
that
they
lived
nearby
in
their
vicinity
17
Then
the
Israelites
set
out
and
came
to
their
cities
on
the
third
day
their
cities
were
Gibeon
Chephirah
Beeroth
and
Kiriath-jearim
18
But
the
Israelites
did
not
attack
them
because
the
chieftains
of
the
assembly
had
sworn
an
oath
to
them
by
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
So
all
the
assembly
began
to
murmur
against
the
chieftains
19
At
this
all
the
chieftains
said
to
the
entire
assembly
Since
we
swore
an
oath
to
them
by
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
we
are
not
allowed
to
hurt
them
20
This
is
what
we
will
do
We
will
let
them
live
so
that
there
is
no
indignation
against
us
because
of
the
oath
that
we
swore
to
them
21
And
the
chieftains
added
Let
them
live
but
let
them
become
gatherers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
all
the
assembly
This
is
what
the
chieftains
promised
them
22
Joshua
now
called
them
and
said
to
them
Why
did
you
trick
us
by
saying
We
are
from
a
place
very
far
away
from
you

when
you
really
live
right
among
us
23
From
now
on
you
are
cursed
and
you
will
always
occupy
a
slaves
position
as
gatherers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
house
of
my
God
24
They
answered
Joshua
It
was
because
your
servants
were
plainly
told
that
Jehovah
your
God
had
commanded
Moses
his
servant
to
give
you
all
the
land
and
to
annihilate
all
its
inhabitants
from
before
you
So
we
were
afraid
for
our
lives
because
of
you
and
that
is
why
we
did
this
25
Now
we
are
at
your
mercy
Do
to
us
whatever
you
think
is
good
and
right
26
And
that
is
what
he
did
with
them
he
saved
them
from
the
hands
of
the
Israelites
and
they
did
not
kill
them
27
But
that
day
Joshua
made
them
gatherers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
assembly
and
for
Jehovahs
altar
at
the
place
that
He
should
choose
and
they
remain
so
to
this
day
1
As
soon
as
King
Adoni-zedek
of
Jerusalem
heard
that
Joshua
had
captured
Ai
and
devoted
it
to
destruction
doing
to
Ai
and
its
king
just
as
he
had
done
to
Jericho
and
its
king
and
how
the
inhabitants
of
Gibeon
had
made
peace
with
Israel
and
remained
among
them
2
he
was
greatly
alarmed
because
Gibeon
was
a
great
city
like
one
of
the
royal
cities
It
was
greater
than
Ai
and
all
its
men
were
warriors
3
So
Adoni-zedek
king
of
Jerusalem
sent
this
message
to
Hoham
king
of
Hebron
Piram
king
of
Jarmuth
Japhia
king
of
Lachish
and
Debir
king
of
Eglon
4
Come
to
my
aid
and
let
us
attack
Gibeon
because
it
has
made
peace
with
Joshua
and
the
Israelites
5
At
this
the
five
kings
of
the
Amorites—the
king
of
Jerusalem
the
king
of
Hebron
the
king
of
Jarmuth
the
king
of
Lachish
and
the
king
of
Eglon—gathered
together
along
with
their
armies
and
they
marched
on
and
encamped
against
Gibeon
to
fight
against
it
6
Then
the
men
of
Gibeon
sent
word
to
Joshua
at
the
camp
at
Gilgal
Do
not
forsake
your
slaves
Come
quickly
Rescue
us
and
help
us
All
the
kings
of
the
Amorites
from
the
mountainous
region
have
gathered
against
us
7
So
Joshua
went
up
from
Gilgal
with
all
the
fighting
men
and
the
mighty
warriors
8
Jehovah
then
said
to
Joshua
Do
not
be
afraid
of
them
for
I
have
handed
them
over
to
you
Not
one
of
them
will
be
able
to
stand
against
you
9
Joshua
came
against
them
by
surprise
after
marching
all
night
long
from
Gilgal
10
Jehovah
threw
them
into
confusion
before
Israel
and
they
inflicted
a
great
slaughter
on
them
at
Gibeon
pursuing
them
by
way
of
the
ascent
of
Beth-horon
and
striking
them
down
as
far
as
Azekah
and
Makkedah
11
While
they
were
fleeing
from
Israel
and
were
on
the
descent
of
Beth-horon
Jehovah
hurled
great
hailstones
from
the
sky
on
them
as
far
as
Azekah
and
they
perished
In
fact
more
died
from
the
hail
than
from
the
sword
of
the
Israelites
12
It
was
then
on
the
day
that
Jehovah
routed
the
Amorites
before
the
eyes
of
the
Israelites
that
Joshua
said
to
Jehovah
before
Israel
Sun
stand
still
over
Gibeon
And
moon
over
the
Valley
of
Aijalon
13
So
the
sun
stood
still
and
the
moon
did
not
move
until
the
nation
could
take
vengeance
on
its
enemies
Is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
Jashar
The
sun
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
sky
and
did
not
hasten
to
set
for
about
a
whole
day
14
There
has
never
been
a
day
like
that
one
either
before
it
or
after
it
when
Jehovah
listened
to
the
voice
of
a
man
for
Jehovah
was
fighting
for
Israel
15
After
that
Joshua
together
with
all
Israel
returned
to
the
camp
at
Gilgal
16
Meanwhile
the
five
kings
fled
and
hid
in
the
cave
at
Makkedah
17
Then
it
was
reported
to
Joshua
The
five
kings
have
been
found
hiding
in
the
cave
at
Makkedah
18
So
Joshua
said
Roll
large
stones
over
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
assign
men
to
guard
them
19
But
the
rest
of
you
should
not
stop
Pursue
your
enemies
and
strike
them
from
the
rear
Do
not
allow
them
to
enter
into
their
cities
for
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
them
into
your
hands
20
After
Joshua
and
the
Israelites
had
finished
inflicting
a
very
great
slaughter
on
them
to
the
point
of
wiping
them
out
except
for
some
survivors
who
escaped
and
entered
into
the
fortified
cities
21
all
the
people
returned
safely
to
Joshua
at
the
camp
at
Makkedah
Not
a
man
dared
to
utter
a
word
against
the
Israelites
22
Then
Joshua
said
Open
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
bring
the
five
kings
out
of
the
cave
to
me
23
So
they
brought
to
him
from
the
cave
these
five
kings
the
king
of
Jerusalem
the
king
of
Hebron
the
king
of
Jarmuth
the
king
of
Lachish
and
the
king
of
Eglon
24
When
they
brought
these
kings
to
Joshua
he
summoned
all
the
men
of
Israel
and
said
to
the
commanders
of
the
fighting
men
who
had
gone
with
him
Come
forward
Place
your
feet
on
the
backs
of
the
necks
of
these
kings
So
they
came
forward
and
placed
their
feet
on
the
backs
of
their
necks
25
Then
Joshua
said
to
them
Do
not
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
Be
courageous
and
strong
for
this
is
what
Jehovah
will
do
to
all
your
enemies
against
whom
you
are
fighting
26
Then
Joshua
struck
them
and
put
them
to
death
and
hung
them
on
five
stakes
and
they
remained
hanging
on
the
stakes
until
the
evening
27
At
sunset
Joshua
ordered
that
they
be
taken
down
off
the
stakes
and
thrown
into
the
cave
where
they
had
hidden
themselves
Then
large
stones
were
placed
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
these
remain
to
this
very
day
28
Joshua
captured
Makkedah
on
that
day
and
struck
it
with
the
sword
He
devoted
its
king
and
everyone
in
it
to
destruction
letting
no
survivor
remain
He
did
to
the
king
of
Makkedah
just
as
he
had
done
to
the
king
of
Jericho
29
Then
Joshua
together
with
all
Israel
went
from
Makkedah
to
Libnah
and
fought
against
Libnah
30
Jehovah
also
gave
it
and
its
king
into
Israels
hand
and
they
struck
it
and
everyone
in
it
with
the
sword
not
letting
a
survivor
remain
in
it
So
they
did
to
its
king
just
as
they
had
done
to
the
king
of
Jericho
31
Next
Joshua
together
with
all
Israel
went
from
Libnah
to
Lachish
and
camped
there
and
fought
against
it
32
Jehovah
gave
Lachish
into
Israels
hand
and
they
captured
it
on
the
second
day
They
struck
it
and
everyone
in
it
with
the
sword
just
as
they
had
done
to
Libnah
33
Then
Horam
king
of
Gezer
went
up
to
help
Lachish
but
Joshua
struck
him
and
his
people
down
until
not
one
survivor
remained
34
Then
Joshua
together
with
all
Israel
went
from
Lachish
to
Eglon
and
camped
there
and
fought
against
it
35
They
captured
it
on
that
day
and
struck
it
with
the
sword
They
devoted
everyone
in
it
to
destruction
on
that
day
just
as
they
had
done
to
Lachish
36
Then
Joshua
together
with
all
Israel
went
up
from
Eglon
to
Hebron
and
fought
against
it
37
They
captured
it
and
struck
it
its
king
its
towns
and
everyone
in
it
with
the
sword
not
letting
any
survivor
remain
Just
as
he
had
done
to
Eglon
he
devoted
it
and
everyone
in
it
to
destruction
38
Finally
Joshua
together
with
all
Israel
turned
toward
Debir
and
fought
against
it
39
He
captured
it
its
king
and
all
its
towns
and
they
struck
them
down
with
the
sword
devoting
everyone
in
it
to
destruction
not
letting
any
survivor
remain
He
did
to
Debir
and
its
king
just
as
he
had
done
to
Hebron
and
to
Libnah
and
its
king
40
Joshua
conquered
all
the
land
of
the
mountainous
region
the
Negeb
the
Shephelah
and
the
slopes
and
all
their
kings
not
letting
any
survivor
remain
he
devoted
everything
that
breathed
to
destruction
just
as
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
had
commanded
41
Joshua
conquered
them
from
Kadesh-barnea
to
Gaza
and
all
the
land
of
Goshen
and
up
to
Gibeon
42
Joshua
captured
all
these
kings
and
their
land
all
at
the
same
time
because
it
was
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
who
was
fighting
for
Israel
43
Then
Joshua
returned
with
all
Israel
to
the
camp
at
Gilgal
1
As
soon
as
Jabin
king
of
Hazor
heard
of
it
he
sent
word
to
Jobab
king
of
Madon
and
to
the
king
of
Shimron
the
king
of
Achshaph
2
the
kings
who
were
in
the
northern
mountainous
region
those
in
the
plains
south
of
Chinnereth
those
in
the
Shephelah
and
on
the
slopes
of
Dor
to
the
west
3
the
Canaanites
to
the
east
and
the
west
the
Amorites
the
Hittites
the
Perizzites
the
Jebusites
in
the
mountainous
region
and
the
Hivites
at
the
base
of
Hermon
in
the
land
of
Mizpah
4
So
they
came
out
with
all
their
armies
a
vast
multitude
as
numerous
as
the
grains
of
sand
on
the
seashore
together
with
very
many
horses
and
war
chariots
5
All
these
kings
agreed
to
meet
and
they
came
and
camped
together
at
the
waters
of
Merom
to
fight
against
Israel
6
At
this
Jehovah
said
to
Joshua
Do
not
be
afraid
because
of
them
for
about
this
time
tomorrow
I
am
giving
over
all
of
them
slain
to
Israel
Their
horses
you
must
hamstring
and
their
chariots
you
must
burn
in
the
fire
7
Joshua
together
with
all
the
fighting
men
then
launched
a
surprise
attack
against
them
along
the
waters
of
Merom
8
Jehovah
gave
them
into
Israels
hand
and
they
defeated
them
and
pursued
them
as
far
as
Great
Sidon
and
Misrephoth-maim
and
the
Valley
of
Mizpeh
to
the
east
and
they
struck
them
down
until
no
survivors
remained
9
Joshua
then
did
to
them
just
as
Jehovah
had
told
him
he
hamstrung
their
horses
and
burned
their
chariots
in
the
fire
10
Moreover
Joshua
then
returned
and
captured
Hazor
and
struck
down
its
king
with
the
sword
because
Hazor
had
formerly
been
the
head
of
all
these
kingdoms
11
They
struck
down
everyone
in
it
with
the
sword
devoting
them
to
destruction
Not
a
breathing
thing
was
left
Then
he
burned
Hazor
in
the
fire
12
Joshua
captured
all
the
cities
of
these
kings
and
defeated
all
their
kings
with
the
sword
He
devoted
them
to
destruction
just
as
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
had
commanded
13
However
Israel
did
not
burn
any
of
the
cities
that
stood
on
their
mounds
except
Hazor
it
was
the
only
one
Joshua
burned
14
All
the
spoil
of
these
cities
and
the
livestock
the
Israelites
plundered
for
themselves
But
they
struck
every
human
with
the
sword
until
they
had
annihilated
each
one
They
did
not
let
anyone
who
breathed
remain
15
Just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
his
servant
so
Moses
commanded
Joshua
and
so
Joshua
did
He
left
nothing
undone
of
all
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
16
Joshua
conquered
all
this
land
the
mountainous
region
all
the
Negeb
all
the
land
of
Goshen
the
Shephelah
the
Arabah
and
the
mountainous
region
of
Israel
and
its
Shephelah
17
from
Mount
Halak
which
goes
up
to
Seir
and
as
far
as
Baal-gad
in
the
Valley
of
Lebanon
at
the
base
of
Mount
Hermon
and
he
captured
all
their
kings
and
defeated
them
putting
them
to
death
18
Joshua
waged
war
with
all
these
kings
for
quite
some
time
19
There
was
no
city
that
made
peace
with
the
Israelites
except
the
Hivites
inhabiting
Gibeon
They
conquered
all
the
others
by
war
20
It
was
Jehovah
who
allowed
their
hearts
to
become
stubborn
so
that
they
waged
war
against
Israel
in
order
for
him
to
devote
them
to
destruction
without
any
favorable
consideration
They
were
to
be
annihilated
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
21
At
that
time
Joshua
wiped
out
the
Anakim
from
the
mountainous
region
from
Hebron
Debir
Anab
and
all
the
mountainous
region
of
Judah
and
all
the
mountainous
region
of
Israel
Joshua
devoted
them
and
their
cities
to
destruction
22
There
were
no
Anakim
left
in
the
land
of
the
Israelites
they
remained
only
in
Gaza
in
Gath
and
in
Ashdod
23
So
Joshua
took
control
of
all
the
land
just
as
Jehovah
had
promised
Moses
and
then
Joshua
gave
it
as
an
inheritance
to
Israel
by
their
shares
to
be
divided
among
their
tribes
And
the
land
had
rest
from
war
1
Now
these
are
the
kings
of
the
land
whom
the
Israelites
defeated
whose
land
they
took
possession
of
on
the
east
side
of
the
Jordan
from
the
Arnon
Valley
up
to
Mount
Hermon
and
all
the
Arabah
toward
the
east
2
King
Sihon
of
the
Amorites
who
lived
in
Heshbon
and
ruled
from
Aroer
which
was
on
the
rim
of
the
Arnon
Valley
and
from
the
middle
of
the
valley
and
half
of
Gilead
as
far
as
the
Valley
of
Jabbok
the
boundary
of
the
Ammonites
3
He
also
ruled
over
the
Arabah
as
far
as
the
Sea
of
Chinnereth
toward
the
east
and
as
far
as
the
Sea
of
the
Arabah
the
Salt
Sea
to
the
east
in
the
direction
of
Beth-jeshimoth
and
toward
the
south
under
the
slopes
of
Pisgah
4
Also
the
territory
of
King
Og
of
Bashan
who
was
one
of
the
last
of
the
Rephaim
and
who
lived
in
Ashtaroth
and
Edrei
5
and
ruled
in
Mount
Hermon
in
Salecah
and
in
all
Bashan
as
far
as
the
boundary
of
the
Geshurites
and
the
Maacathites
and
half
of
Gilead
to
the
territory
of
King
Sihon
of
Heshbon
6
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
and
the
Israelites
defeated
them
after
which
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
gave
their
land
as
a
possession
to
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
7
These
are
the
kings
of
the
land
whom
Joshua
and
the
Israelites
defeated
on
the
west
side
of
the
Jordan
from
Baal-gad
in
the
Valley
of
Lebanon
and
as
far
as
Mount
Halak
which
goes
up
to
Seir
after
which
Joshua
gave
their
land
to
the
tribes
of
Israel
as
a
possession
by
their
shares
8
in
the
mountainous
region
in
the
Shephelah
in
the
Arabah
on
the
slopes
in
the
wilderness
and
in
the
Negeb—the
land
of
the
Hittites
the
Amorites
the
Canaanites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites

a
total

1
Now
Joshua
had
grown
old
and
was
advanced
in
years
So
Jehovah
said
to
him
You
have
grown
old
and
are
advanced
in
years
but
much
of
the
land
remains
to
be
taken
in
possession
2
This
is
the
land
remaining
all
the
regions
of
the
Philistines
and
all
the
Geshurites
3
from
the
branch
of
the
Nile
that
is
east
of
Egypt
up
to
the
border
of
Ekron
to
the
north
which
used
to
be
considered
Canaanite
territory
including
that
of
the
five
lords
of
the
Philistines—the
Gazites
the
Ashdodites
the
Ashkelonites
the
Gittites
and
the
Ekronites
that
of
the
Avvim
4
to
the
south
all
the
land
of
the
Canaanites
Mearah
which
belongs
to
the
Sidonians
as
far
as
Aphek
to
the
border
of
the
Amorites
5
the
land
of
the
Gebalites
and
all
of
Lebanon
toward
the
east
from
Baal-gad
at
the
base
of
Mount
Hermon
to
Lebo-hamath
6
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
mountainous
region
from
Lebanon
to
Misrephoth-maim
and
all
the
Sidonians
I
will
drive
them
out
before
the
Israelites
You
have
only
to
assign
it
to
Israel
as
an
inheritance
just
as
I
have
commanded
you
7
Now
you
must
apportion
this
land
as
an
inheritance
to
the
nine
tribes
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
8
With
the
other
half
tribe
the
Reubenites
and
the
Gadites
took
their
inheritance
that
Moses
gave
them
on
the
east
side
of
the
Jordan
just
as
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
had
given
them
9
from
Aroer
which
is
on
the
rim
of
the
Arnon
Valley
and
the
city
that
is
in
the
middle
of
the
valley
and
all
the
tableland
of
Medeba
as
far
as
Dibon
10
and
all
the
cities
of
King
Sihon
of
the
Amorites
who
reigned
in
Heshbon
up
to
the
border
of
the
Ammonites
11
also
Gilead
and
the
territory
of
the
Geshurites
and
the
Maacathites
and
all
Mount
Hermon
and
all
Bashan
as
far
as
Salecah
12
all
the
royal
realm
of
Og
in
Bashan
who
reigned
in
Ashtaroth
and
in
Edrei
He
was
one
of
the
last
of
the
Rephaim
Moses
defeated
them
and
drove
them
out
13
But
the
Israelites
did
not
drive
out
the
Geshurites
and
the
Maacathites
for
Geshur
and
Maacath
live
in
the
midst
of
Israel
to
this
day
14
It
was
only
to
the
tribe
of
the
Levites
that
he
did
not
give
an
inheritance
The
offerings
made
by
fire
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
are
their
inheritance
just
as
he
promised
them
15
Then
Moses
gave
an
inheritance
to
the
tribe
of
the
Reubenites
by
their
families
16
and
their
territory
was
from
Aroer
which
is
on
the
rim
of
the
Arnon
Valley
and
the
city
in
the
middle
of
the
valley
and
all
the
tableland

21
all
the
cities
of
the
tableland
and
all
the
royal
realm
of
King
Sihon
of
the
Amorites
who
reigned
in
Heshbon
Moses
defeated
him
and
the
Midianite
chieftains
Evi
Rekem
Zur
Hur
and
Reba
vassals
of
Sihon
who
were
dwelling
in
the
land
22
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
the
diviner
was
one
whom
the
Israelites
killed
with
the
sword
along
with
the
rest
who
were
slain
23
The
boundary
of
the
Reubenites
was
the
Jordan
and
this
territory
was
the
inheritance
of
the
Reubenites
by
their
families
with
the
cities
and
their
settlements
24
Furthermore
Moses
gave
an
inheritance
to
the
tribe
of
Gad
the
Gadites
by
their
families
25
and
their
territory
included
Jazer
and
all
the
cities
of
Gilead
and
half
of
the
land
of
the
Ammonites
as
far
as
Aroer
which
faces
Rabbah
26
and
from
Heshbon
to
Ramath-mizpeh
and
Betonim
and
from
Mahanaim
to
the
border
of
Debir
27
and
in
the
valley
Beth-haram
Beth-nimrah
Succoth
and
Zaphon
the
rest
of
the
royal
realm
of
King
Sihon
of
Heshbon
with
the
Jordan
as
the
border
from
the
lower
end
of
the
Sea
of
Chinnereth
on
the
east
side
of
the
Jordan
28
This
was
the
inheritance
of
the
Gadites
by
their
families
with
the
cities
and
their
settlements
29
Further
Moses
gave
an
inheritance
to
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
to
half
of
the
tribe
of
Manasseh
by
their
families
30
And
their
territory
extended
from
Mahanaim
and
took
in
all
of
Bashan
all
the
royal
realm
of
King
Og
of
Bashan
and
all
the
tent
villages
of
Jair
in
Bashan
60
towns
31
And
half
of
Gilead
and
Ashtaroth
and
Edrei
the
cities
of
the
royal
realm
of
Og
in
Bashan
went
to
the
sons
of
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh
to
half
of
the
sons
of
Machir
by
their
families
32
These
were
the
inheritances
that
Moses
gave
them
on
the
desert
plains
of
Moab
beyond
the
Jordan
east
of
Jericho
33
But
to
the
tribe
of
the
Levites
Moses
did
not
give
an
inheritance
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
is
their
inheritance
just
as
he
promised
them
1
Now
this
is
what
the
Israelites
took
as
an
inheritance
in
the
land
of
Canaan
which
Eleazar
the
priest
and
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
and
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
gave
them
to
inherit
2
Their
inheritance
was
by
lot
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
through
Moses
for
the
nine
and
a
half
tribes
3
Moses
had
given
the
inheritance
of
the
other
two
and
a
half
tribes
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
and
to
the
Levites
he
did
not
give
an
inheritance
among
them
4
The
descendants
of
Joseph
were
considered
two
tribes
Manasseh
and
Ephraim
and
they
did
not
give
a
share
in
the
land
to
the
Levites
except
cities
to
dwell
in
and
their
pastures
for
their
livestock
and
their
property
5
So
the
Israelites
apportioned
the
land
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
Moses
6
Then
the
men
of
Judah
approached
Joshua
in
Gilgal
and
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
the
Kenizzite
said
to
him
You
well
know
what
Jehovah
said
to
Moses
the
man
of
the
true
God
about
you
and
me
at
Kadesh-barnea
7
I
was
40
years
old
when
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
sent
me
out
of
Kadesh-barnea
to
spy
out
the
land
and
I
returned
with
a
forthright
report
8
Although
my
brothers
who
went
up
with
me
caused
the
people
to
lose
heart
I
followed
Jehovah
my
God
wholeheartedly
9
Moses
swore
on
that
day
saying
The
land
on
which
your
foot
has
walked
will
become
a
lasting
inheritance
for
you
and
your
sons
because
you
have
followed
Jehovah
my
God
wholeheartedly
10
Now
just
as
he
promised
Jehovah
has
preserved
me
alive
these
45
years
since
Jehovah
made
this
promise
to
Moses
when
Israel
walked
in
the
wilderness
I
am
still
here
today
85
years
old
11
And
today
I
am
as
strong
as
on
the
day
Moses
sent
me
out
My
strength
is
now
as
it
was
then
for
war
and
for
other
activities
12
Therefore
give
me
this
mountainous
region
that
Jehovah
promised
on
that
day
Though
you
heard
on
that
day
that
there
were
Anakim
there
with
great
fortified
cities
surely
Jehovah
will
be
with
me
and
I
will
drive
them
out
just
as
Jehovah
promised
13
So
Joshua
blessed
him
and
gave
Hebron
to
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
as
an
inheritance
14
That
is
why
Hebron
belongs
to
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
the
Kenizzite
as
an
inheritance
to
this
day
because
he
followed
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
wholeheartedly
15
The
name
of
Hebron
was
previously
Kiriath-arba
Arba
was
the
great
man
among
the
Anakim
And
the
land
had
rest
from
war
1
The
land
allotted
to
the
tribe
of
Judah
for
their
families
extended
to
the
boundary
of
Edom
the
wilderness
of
Zin
to
the
Negeb
at
its
southern
end
2
Their
southern
boundary
ran
from
the
extremity
of
the
Salt
Sea
from
the
bay
that
faces
southward
3
And
it
extended
south
to
the
ascent
of
Akrabbim
passed
over
to
Zin
then
went
up
from
the
south
to
Kadesh-barnea
over
to
Hezron
up
to
Addar
and
went
around
toward
Karka
4
Then
it
passed
on
to
Azmon
and
extended
to
the
Wadi
of
Egypt
and
the
boundary
ended
at
the
Sea
This
was
their
southern
boundary
5
The
eastern
boundary
was
the
Salt
Sea
up
to
the
end
of
the
Jordan
and
the
boundary
at
the
northern
corner
was
at
the
bay
of
the
sea
at
the
end
of
the
Jordan
6
The
boundary
went
up
to
Beth-hoglah
and
passed
over
at
the
north
of
Beth-arabah
and
the
boundary
went
up
to
the
stone
of
Bohan
the
son
of
Reuben
7
The
boundary
went
up
to
Debir
at
the
Valley
of
Achor
and
turned
northward
to
Gilgal
which
is
in
front
of
the
ascent
of
Adummim
that
is
south
of
the
wadi
and
the
boundary
passed
over
to
the
waters
of
En-shemesh
and
ended
at
En-rogel
8
The
boundary
went
up
to
the
Valley
of
the
Son
of
Hinnom
to
the
slope
of
the
Jebusite
at
the
south
that
is
Jerusalem
and
the
boundary
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
that
faces
the
Valley
of
Hinnom
to
the
west
which
is
at
the
extremity
of
the
Valley
of
Rephaim
to
the
north
9
And
the
boundary
was
marked
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
the
spring
of
the
waters
of
Nephtoah
and
extended
to
the
cities
of
Mount
Ephron
and
the
boundary
was
marked
to
Baalah
that
is
Kiriath-jearim
10
The
boundary
went
around
from
Baalah
westward
to
Mount
Seir
and
passed
over
to
the
slope
of
Mount
Jearim
at
the
north
that
is
Chesalon
and
it
went
down
to
Beth-shemesh
and
passed
over
to
Timnah
11
And
the
boundary
extended
to
the
slope
of
Ekron
to
the
north
and
the
boundary
was
marked
to
Shikkeron
and
passed
over
to
Mount
Baalah
and
extended
to
Jabneel
and
the
boundary
ended
at
the
sea
12
The
western
boundary
was
at
the
Great
Sea
and
its
coast
This
was
the
boundary
of
the
descendants
of
Judah
by
their
families
on
all
sides
13
And
to
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
he
gave
a
share
among
the
descendants
of
Judah
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
to
Joshua
namely
Kiriath-arba
Arba
was
the
father
of
Anak
that
is
Hebron
14
So
Caleb
drove
out
from
there
the
three
sons
of
Anak
Sheshai
Ahiman
and
Talmai
descendants
of
Anak
15
Then
he
went
up
from
there
against
the
inhabitants
of
Debir
The
name
of
Debir
was
previously
Kiriath-sepher
16
Caleb
then
said
To
the
man
who
strikes
Kiriath-sepher
and
captures
it
I
will
give
my
daughter
Achsah
as
a
wife
17
And
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz
Calebs
brother
captured
it
So
he
gave
him
his
daughter
Achsah
as
a
wife
18
While
she
was
going
home
she
urged
him
to
ask
her
father
for
a
field
Then
she
dismounted
from
her
donkey
Caleb
asked
her
What
do
you
want
19
She
said
Please
grant
me
a
blessing
for
you
have
given
me
a
piece
of
land
in
the
south
give
me
also
Gulloth-maim
So
he
gave
her
Upper
Gulloth
and
Lower
Gulloth
20
This
was
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
by
their
families
21
The

As
for
the
Jebusites
who
were
dwelling
in
Jerusalem
the
men
of
Judah
were
not
able
to
drive
them
away
so
the
Jebusites
continue
dwelling
with
the
people
of
Judah
in
Jerusalem
to
this
day
1
And
the
land
that
fell
by
lot
to
the
descendants
of
Joseph
was
from
the
Jordan
at
Jericho
to
the
waters
east
of
Jericho
through
the
wilderness
going
up
from
Jericho
into
the
mountainous
region
of
Bethel
2
It
extended
from
Bethel
belonging
to
Luz
and
continued
to
the
boundary
of
the
Archites
at
Ataroth
3
then
it
went
down
westward
to
the
boundary
of
the
Japhletites
as
far
as
the
boundary
of
Lower
Beth-horon
and
Gezer
and
it
ended
at
the
sea
4
So
Josephs
descendants
Manasseh
and
Ephraim
took
possession
of
their
land
5
The
boundary
of
the
descendants
of
Ephraim
by
their
families
was
as
follows
The
boundary
of
their
inheritance
to
the
east
was
Ataroth-addar
as
far
as
Upper
Beth-horon
6
and
the
boundary
extended
to
the
sea
Michmethath
was
on
the
north
and
the
boundary
went
around
east
to
Taanath-shiloh
and
it
passed
on
the
east
to
Janoah
7
Then
it
went
down
from
Janoah
to
Ataroth
and
Naarah
and
reached
to
Jericho
and
extended
to
the
Jordan
8
From
Tappuah
the
boundary
continued
westward
to
the
Wadi
of
Kanah
and
it
ended
at
the
sea
This
is
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
Ephraim
by
their
families
9
the
descendants
of
Ephraim
also
had
enclave
cities
in
the
midst
of
the
inheritance
of
Manasseh
all
the
cities
and
their
settlements
10
But
they
did
not
drive
away
the
Canaanites
who
were
dwelling
in
Gezer
and
the
Canaanites
continue
to
dwell
among
Ephraim
to
this
day
and
have
been
subjected
to
forced
labor
1
Then
the
lot
fell
for
the
tribe
of
Manasseh
because
he
was
Josephs
firstborn
Since
Machir
the
firstborn
of
Manasseh
and
the
father
of
Gilead
was
a
man
of
war
he
received
Gilead
and
Bashan
2
And
the
lot
fell
for
the
rest
of
the
descendants
of
Manasseh
according
to
their
families
for
the
sons
of
Abi-ezer
the
sons
of
Helek
the
sons
of
Asriel
the
sons
of
Shechem
the
sons
of
Hepher
and
the
sons
of
Shemida
These
were
the
descendants
of
Manasseh
the
son
of
Joseph
the
males
according
to
their
families
3
But
Zelophehad
the
son
of
Hepher
the
son
of
Gilead
the
son
of
Machir
the
son
of
Manasseh
did
not
have
sons
only
daughters
and
these
were
the
names
of
his
daughters
Mahlah
Noah
Hoglah
Milcah
and
Tirzah
4
So
they
presented
themselves
before
Eleazar
the
priest
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
and
the
chieftains
saying
It
was
Jehovah
who
commanded
Moses
to
give
us
an
inheritance
among
our
brothers
So
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
he
gave
them
an
inheritance
among
the
brothers
of
their
father
5
There
were
also
ten
allotments
that
fell
to
Manasseh
apart
from
the
land
of
Gilead
and
Bashan
which
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
6
for
the
daughters
of
Manasseh
received
an
inheritance
along
with
his
sons
and
the
land
of
Gilead
became
the
property
of
the
rest
of
the
descendants
of
Manasseh
7
And
the
boundary
of
Manasseh
was
from
Asher
to
Michmethath
which
faces
Shechem
and
the
boundary
continued
toward
the
south
to
the
land
of
the
inhabitants
of
En-Tappuah
8
The
land
of
Tappuah
became
Manassehs
but
Tappuah
on
Manassehs
boundary
belonged
to
the
descendants
of
Ephraim
9
And
the
boundary
went
down
to
the
Wadi
of
Kanah
southward
to
the
wadi
There
were
cities
of
Ephraim
among
the
cities
of
Manasseh
and
the
boundary
of
Manasseh
was
on
the
north
of
the
wadi
and
it
ended
at
the
sea
10
To
the
south
it
belonged
to
Ephraim
and
to
the
north
it
belonged
to
Manasseh
and
the
sea
was
his
boundary
and
on
the
north
they
reached
to
Asher
and
on
the
east
to
Issachar
11
In
the
territories
of
Issachar
and
Asher
Manasseh
was
given
Beth-shean
and
its
dependent
towns
Ibleam
and
its
dependent
towns
the
inhabitants
of
Dor
and
its
dependent
towns
the
inhabitants
of
En-dor
and
its
dependent
towns
the
inhabitants
of
Taanach
and
its
dependent
towns
and
the
inhabitants
of
Megiddo
and
its
dependent
towns
three
of
the
heights
12
But
the
descendants
of
Manasseh
were
not
able
to
take
possession
of
these
cities
the
Canaanites
persisted
in
dwelling
in
this
land
13
When
the
Israelites
grew
strong
they
subjected
the
Canaanites
to
forced
labor
but
they
did
not
drive
them
out
entirely
14
The
descendants
of
Joseph
said
to
Joshua
Why
have
you
given
us
as
an
inheritance
only
one
lot
and
one
allotment
We
are
a
numerous
people
for
Jehovah
has
blessed
us
until
now
15
Joshua
replied
to
them
If
you
are
such
a
numerous
people
go
up
to
the
forest
and
clear
out
a
place
for
yourself
there
in
the
land
of
the
Perizzites
and
the
Rephaim
since
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
is
too
cramped
for
you
16
Then
the
descendants
of
Joseph
said
The
mountainous
region
is
not
enough
for
us
and
all
the
Canaanites
who
are
dwelling
in
the
land
of
the
valley
have
war
chariots
with
iron
scythes
both
those
in
Beth-shean
and
its
dependent
towns
and
those
in
the
Valley
of
Jezreel
17
So
Joshua
said
this
to
the
house
of
Joseph
to
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
You
are
a
numerous
people
and
you
have
great
power
You
will
not
receive
only
one
lot
18
but
the
mountainous
region
will
also
be
yours
Although
it
is
a
forest
you
will
clear
it
and
it
will
be
the
extremity
of
your
territory
For
you
will
drive
away
the
Canaanites
even
though
they
are
strong
and
have
war
chariots
with
iron
scythes
1
Then
all
the
assembly
of
the
Israelites
congregated
at
Shiloh
and
they
set
up
the
tent
of
meeting
there
as
the
land
was
now
subdued
before
them
2
But
there
were
still
seven
tribes
left
of
the
Israelites
whose
inheritance
had
not
been
allotted
3
So
Joshua
said
to
the
Israelites
How
long
will
you
put
off
going
in
to
take
possession
of
the
land
that
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
has
given
you
4
Give
me
three
men
from
each
tribe
to
send
out
they
should
go
out
and
walk
throughout
the
land
and
map
it
out
according
to
their
inheritance
Then
they
should
return
to
me
5
They
must
apportion
it
among
themselves
into
seven
shares
Judah
will
remain
in
his
territory
to
the
south
and
the
house
of
Joseph
will
remain
in
their
territory
to
the
north
6
As
for
you
map
out
the
land
into
seven
shares
and
bring
them
here
to
me
and
I
will
cast
lots
here
for
you
before
Jehovah
our
God
7
But
the
Levites
have
no
share
among
you
because
the
priesthood
of
Jehovah
is
their
inheritance
and
Gad
Reuben
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
have
already
taken
their
inheritance
on
the
east
side
of
the
Jordan
which
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
gave
them
8
The
men
prepared
to
go
and
Joshua
commanded
those
who
were
to
map
out
the
land
Go
and
walk
through
the
land
and
map
it
out
and
return
to
me
and
I
will
cast
lots
for
you
here
before
Jehovah
in
Shiloh
9
With
that
the
men
went
and
traveled
through
the
land
and
mapped
it
out
by
cities
into
seven
shares
recording
it
in
a
book
After
that
they
returned
to
Joshua
at
the
camp
in
Shiloh
10
Joshua
then
cast
lots
for
them
in
Shiloh
before
Jehovah
There
Joshua
apportioned
the
land
to
the
Israelites
by
their
shares
11
The
lot
came
up
for
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
by
their
families
and
the
territory
of
their
lot
was
between
the
people
of
Judah
and
the
people
of
Joseph
12
On
the
north
side
their
boundary
started
at
the
Jordan
and
the
boundary
went
up
to
the
slope
of
Jericho
on
the
north
and
went
up
on
the
mountain
westward
and
it
extended
to
the
wilderness
of
Beth-aven
13
And
the
boundary
continued
from
there
to
Luz
at
the
southern
slope
of
Luz
that
is
Bethel
the
boundary
went
down
to
Ataroth-addar
on
the
mountain
that
is
south
of
Lower
Beth-horon
14
And
the
boundary
was
marked
at
the
western
side
and
went
around
toward
the
south
from
the
mountain
that
faces
Beth-horon
to
the
south
it
ended
at
Kiriath-baal
that
is
Kiriath-jearim
a
city
of
Judah
This
is
the
western
side
15
The
south
side
was
from
the
extremity
of
Kiriath-jearim
and
the
boundary
extended
westward
it
went
out
to
the
spring
of
the
waters
of
Nephtoah
16
The
boundary
went
down
to
the
extremity
of
the
mountain
that
faces
the
Valley
of
the
Son
of
Hinnom
which
is
in
the
Valley
of
Rephaim
to
the
north
and
it
went
down
to
the
Valley
of
Hinnom
to
the
slope
of
the
Jebusite
on
the
south
and
down
to
En-rogel
17
And
it
was
marked
northward
and
extended
to
En-shemesh
and
then
out
to
Geliloth
which
is
in
front
of
the
ascent
of
Adummim
and
it
went
down
to
the
stone
of
Bohan
the
son
of
Reuben
18
And
it
continued
to
the
northern
slope
in
front
of
the
Arabah
and
went
down
to
the
Arabah
19
And
the
boundary
continued
to
the
northern
slope
of
Beth-hoglah
and
the
boundary
ended
at
the
northern
bay
of
the
Salt
Sea
at
the
southern
end
of
the
Jordan
This
was
the
southern
boundary
20
And
the
Jordan
served
as
its
boundary
on
the
eastern
side
This
was
the
inheritance
of
the
descendants
of
Benjamin
by
their
families
according
to
its
boundaries
on
all
sides
21
And
the
cities
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
by
their
families
were
Jericho
Beth-hoglah
Emek-keziz
22
Beth-arabah
Zemaraim

1
Then
the
second
lot

8
and
all
the
settlements
that
were
around
these
cities
as
far
as
Baalath-beer
Ramah
of
the
south
This
was
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
Simeon
by
their
families
9
The
inheritance
of
the
descendants
of
Simeon
was
taken
out
of
the
allotment
of
Judah
because
the
share
of
Judah
was
too
large
for
them
So
the
descendants
of
Simeon
received
a
possession
within
their
inheritance
10
Next
the
third
lot
came
up
for
the
descendants
of

Their

12
And
it

toward
the
sunrise
to
the
border
of
Chisloth-tabor
and
out
to
Daberath
and
then

And
from
there
it
continued
eastward
toward
the
sunrise
to
Gath-hepher
to
Eth-kazin
and
out
to
Rimmon
and
it
extended
to

14
And

This
was
the

by
their
families

cities
and
their

24
Then

and

And
the
boundary
went

Then

and
it
ended
at
the
sea
in
the
region
of
Achzib
30
Ummah
Aphek
and
Rehob—22
cities
and
their

31
This
was
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
Asher
by
their
families
These
were
the
cities
and
their
settlements
32
The
sixth
lot
came
out
for
the
descendants
of
Naphtali
for
the
descendants
of
Naphtali
by
their
families
33
Their

Heleph
from

big
tree
in

and

and

34
The

and
reached

on
the
south
and
to
Asher
on
the
west
and
to

39
This
was
the

the
tribe
of
Naphtali
by
their
families
the
cities
and
their
settlements
40
The
seventh
lot
came
out
for
the
tribe
of
Dan
by
their
families
41
And
the
border
of
their
inheritance
was

42
Shaalabbin
Aijalon
Ithlah
43
Elon
Timnah
Ekron
44
Eltekeh
Gibbethon
Baalath
45
Jehud
Bene-berak
Gath-rimmon
46
Me-jarkon
and
Rakkon
with
the
border
facing
Joppa
47
But
the
territory
of
Dan
was
too
cramped
for
them
So
they
went
up
and
fought
against
Leshem
and
captured
it
and
struck
it
with
the
sword
Then
they
took
possession
of
it
and
settled
in
it
and
they
changed
the
name
of
Leshem
to
Dan
after
the
name
of
Dan
their
forefather
48
This
was
the
inheritance
of
the
tribe
of
Dan
by
their
families
These
were
the
cities
and
their
settlements
49
Thus
they
finished
dividing
the
land
for
inheritance
by
its
territories
Then
the
Israelites
gave
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
an
inheritance
in
their
midst
50
At
the
order
of
Jehovah
they
gave
him
the
city
he
asked
for
Timnath-serah
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
and
he
built
up
the
city
and
settled
in
it
51
These
were
the
inheritances
that
Eleazar
the
priest
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
and
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
distributed
by
lot
in
Shiloh
before
Jehovah
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
So
they
finished
apportioning
the
land
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Joshua
2
Tell
the
Israelites
Select
for
yourselves
the
cities
of
refuge
about
which
I
spoke
to
you
through
Moses
3
so
that
the
manslayer
who
unintentionally
or
accidentally
kills
someone
may
flee
there
And
they
will
serve
as
a
refuge
for
you
from
the
avenger
of
blood
4
He
must
flee
to
one
of
these
cities
and
stand
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
gate
and
present
his
case
in
the
hearing
of
the
elders
of
that
city
Then
they
must
receive
him
into
the
city
and
give
him
a
place
and
he
will
live
with
them
5
If
the
avenger
of
blood
chases
after
him
they
should
not
surrender
the
manslayer
into
his
hand
for
he
killed
his
fellow
man
accidentally
and
he
did
not
previously
hate
him
6
He
must
dwell
in
that
city
until
he
stands
trial
before
the
assembly
and
remain
there
until
the
death
of
the
high
priest
who
is
in
office
at
that
time
Then
the
manslayer
may
return
to
the
city
from
which
he
fled
and
he
may
enter
his
city
and
his
house
7
So
they
gave
a
sacred
status
to
Kedesh
in
Galilee
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Naphtali
Shechem
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
and
Kiriath-arba
that
is
Hebron
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Judah
8
In
the
region
of
the
Jordan
east
of
Jericho
they
selected
Bezer
in
the
wilderness
on
the
tableland
out
of
the
tribe
of
Reuben
Ramoth
in
Gilead
out
of
the
tribe
of
Gad
and
Golan
in
Bashan
out
of
the
tribe
of
Manasseh
9
These
became
the
cities
appointed
for
all
the
Israelites
and
for
the
foreign
residents
residing
among
them
so
that
anyone
who
unintentionally
killed
someone
could
flee
there
and
not
die
by
the
hand
of
the
avenger
of
blood
prior
to
standing
trial
before
the
assembly
1
The
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
Levites
now
approached
Eleazar
the
priest
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
and
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
2
and
they
spoke
to
them
in
Shiloh
in
the
land
of
Canaan
saying
Jehovah
through
Moses
commanded
that
we
be
given
cities
in
which
to
dwell
along
with
their
pastures
for
our
livestock
3
So
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
the
Israelites
gave
the
Levites
these
cities
and
their
pastures
out
of
their
own
inheritance
4
The
lot
came
out
for
the
families
of
the
Kohathites
and
the
Levites
who
were
descendants
of
Aaron
the
priest
were
given
by
lot
13
cities
out
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
the
tribe
of
Simeon
and
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
5
And
for
the
rest
of
the
Kohathites
there
were
allotted
ten
cities
out
of
the
families
of
the
tribe
of
Ephraim
the
tribe
of
Dan
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
6
And
for
the
Gershonites
there
were
allotted
13
cities
out
of
the
families
of
the
tribe
of
Issachar
the
tribe
of
Asher
the
tribe
of
Naphtali
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
in
Bashan
7
For
the
Merarites
by
their
families
there
were
12
cities
out
of
the
tribe
of
Reuben
the
tribe
of
Gad
and
the
tribe
of
Zebulun
8
Thus
the
Israelites
gave
the
Levites
these
cities
and
their
pastures
by
lot
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
through
Moses
9
So
from
the
tribe
of
Judah
and
the
tribe
of
Simeon
they
gave
these
cities
here
mentioned
by
name
10
and
they
were
given
to
the
sons
of
Aaron
of
the
Kohathite
families
of
the
Levites
because
they
received
the
first
lot
11
They
gave
them
Kiriath-arba
Arba
was
the
father
of
Anak
that
is
Hebron
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Judah
and
its
surrounding
pastures
12
But
the
field
of
the
city
and
its
settlements
they
gave
to
Caleb
the
son
of
Jephunneh
as
his
possession
13
And
to
the
sons
of
Aaron
the
priest
they
gave

with
its
pastures
Geba
with
its
pastures
18
Anathoth
with
its
pastures
and
Almon
with
its
pastures—four

19
All
the
cities
given
to
the
descendants
of
Aaron
the
priests
were
13
cities
with
their
pastures
20
And
the
rest
of
the
Kohathite
families
among
the
Levites
were
given
by
lot
cities
from
the
tribe
of
Ephraim
21
They
gave
them
the
city
of

for
the

namely

in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim

25
And
from
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
Taanach
with
its
pastures
and
Gath-rimmon
with
its
pastures—two
cities
26
All
the
cities
together
with
their
pastures
that
the
rest
of
the
families
of
the
Kohathites
received
were
ten
27
And
the
Gershonites
of
the
families
of
the
Levites
received
from
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
the
city
of
refuge
for
the
manslayer
namely
Golan
in
Bashan
with
its
pastures
and
Beeshterah
with
its
pastures—two
cities
28
And
from
the
tribe
of
Issachar
Kishion
with
its
pastures
Daberath
with
its
pastures
29
Jarmuth
with
its
pastures
and
En-gannim
with
its
pastures—four
cities
30
And
from
the
tribe
of
Asher
Mishal
with
its
pastures
Abdon
with
its
pastures
31
Helkath
with
its
pastures
and
Rehob
with
its
pastures—four
cities
32
And
from
the
tribe
of
Naphtali
the
city
of
refuge
for
the
manslayer
namely
Kedesh
in
Galilee
with
its
pastures
Hammoth-dor
with
its
pastures
and
Kartan
with
its
pastures—three
cities
33
All
the
cities
of
the
Gershonites
by
their
families
were
13
cities
with
their
pastures
34
And
the
families
of
the
Merarites
the
rest
of
the
Levites
received
from
the
tribe
of
Zebulun
Jokneam
with
its
pastures
Kartah
with
its
pastures
35
Dimnah
with
its
pastures
and
Nahalal
with
its
pastures—four
cities
36
And
from
the
tribe
of
Reuben
Bezer
with
its
pastures
Jahaz
with
its
pastures
37
Kedemoth
with
its
pastures
and
Mephaath
with
its
pastures—four
cities
38
And
from
the
tribe
of
Gad
the
city
of
refuge
for
the
manslayer
namely
Ramoth
in
Gilead
with
its
pastures
Mahanaim
with
its
pastures
39
Heshbon
with
its
pastures
and
Jazer
with
its
pastures—a
total
of
four
cities
40
All
the
cities
that
were
allotted
to
the
Merarites
by
their
families
the
rest
of
the
families
of
the
Levites
were
12
cities
41
All
the
cities
of
the
Levites
within
the
possession
of
the
Israelites
were
48
cities
together
with
their
pastures
42
Each
of
these
cities
had
its
pastures
all
around
it—this
was
the
case
for
all
these
cities
43
So
Jehovah
gave
Israel
all
the
land
that
he
had
sworn
to
give
to
their
forefathers
and
they
took
possession
of
it
and
settled
in
it
44
Furthermore
Jehovah
gave
them
rest
on
every
side
just
as
he
had
sworn
to
their
forefathers
and
not
one
of
all
their
enemies
could
stand
against
them
Jehovah
gave
all
their
enemies
into
their
hand
45
Not
a
promise
failed
out
of
all
the
good
promises
that
Jehovah
had
made
to
the
house
of
Israel
all
of
them
came
true
1
Then
Joshua
summoned
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
2
and
said
to
them
You
have
done
all
that
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
commanded
you
and
you
have
obeyed
my
voice
in
all
that
I
commanded
you
3
You
have
not
forsaken
your
brothers
all
this
time
down
to
this
day
and
you
have
kept
the
obligation
of
the
commandment
of
Jehovah
your
God
4
Now
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
your
brothers
rest
just
as
he
promised
them
So
now
you
may
return
to
your
tents
in
the
land
that
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
gave
you
to
possess
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
5
Only
be
very
careful
to
carry
out
the
commandment
and
the
Law
that
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
gave
you
by
loving
Jehovah
your
God
by
walking
in
all
his
ways
by
keeping
his
commandments
by
sticking
to
him
and
by
serving
him
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul
6
Then
Joshua
blessed
them
and
sent
them
away
and
they
went
to
their
tents
7
And
to
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
Moses
had
given
an
inheritance
in
Bashan
and
to
the
other
half
of
the
tribe
Joshua
gave
land
on
the
west
side
of
the
Jordan
along
with
their
brothers
Moreover
when
Joshua
sent
them
away
to
their
tents
he
blessed
them
8
and
said
to
them
Return
to
your
tents
with
many
riches
with
very
much
livestock
with
silver
and
gold
copper
and
iron
and
garments
in
very
great
quantity
Take
your
share
of
the
spoil
of
your
enemies
along
with
your
brothers
9
After
that
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
departed
from
the
other
Israelites
from
Shiloh
in
the
land
of
Canaan
and
they
returned
to
the
land
of
Gilead
the
land
of
their
possession
where
they
had
settled
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
through
Moses
10
When
they
came
to
the
regions
of
the
Jordan
in
the
land
of
Canaan
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
built
an
altar
there
by
the
Jordan
a
large
impressive
altar
11
Later
the
other
Israelites
heard
about
it
and
said
Look
The
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
have
built
an
altar
on
the
frontier
of
the
land
of
Canaan
in
the
regions
of
the
Jordan
on
the
side
belonging
to
the
Israelites
12
When
the
Israelites
heard
about
it
the
whole
assembly
of
the
Israelites
congregated
at
Shiloh
to
go
to
war
against
them
13
Then
the
Israelites
sent
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
priest
to
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
in
the
land
of
Gilead
14
and
ten
chieftains
were
with
him
one
chieftain
of
each
paternal
house
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
each
a
head
of
his
paternal
house
among
the
thousands
of
Israel
15
When
they
came
to
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
in
the
land
of
Gilead
they
said
to
them
16
This
is
what
all
the
assembly
of
Jehovah
says
What
is
this
act
of
unfaithfulness
that
you
have
committed
against
the
God
of
Israel
You
have
turned
back
today
from
following
Jehovah
by
building
yourselves
an
altar
and
rebelling
against
Jehovah
17
Was
the
error
of
Peor
not
enough
for
us
We
have
not
cleansed
ourselves
from
it
down
to
this
day
even
though
a
plague
came
upon
the
assembly
of
Jehovah
18
And
you
would
turn
back
today
from
following
Jehovah
If
you
rebel
today
against
Jehovah
then
tomorrow
he
will
be
indignant
against
the
entire
assembly
of
Israel
19
Now
if
it
is
because
the
land
of
your
possession
is
unclean
cross
over
to
the
land
of
Jehovahs
possession
where
the
tabernacle
of
Jehovah
resides
and
settle
among
us
but
do
not
rebel
against
Jehovah
and
do
not
make
us
rebels
by
building
yourselves
an
altar
in
addition
to
the
altar
of
Jehovah
our
God
20
When
Achan
the
son
of
Zerah
committed
an
act
of
unfaithfulness
regarding
what
was
devoted
to
destruction
did
not
indignation
come
against
all
the
assembly
of
Israel
And
he
was
not
the
only
man
to
die
for
his
error
21
At
this
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
said
in
answer
to
the
heads
of
the
thousands
of
Israel
22
The
God
of
gods
Jehovah
The
God
of
gods
Jehovah
He
knows
and
Israel
will
also
know
If
we
were
rebellious
and
unfaithful
to
Jehovah
do
not
spare
us
this
day
23
If
we
built
ourselves
an
altar
to
turn
back
from
following
Jehovah
and
to
offer
burnt
offerings
grain
offerings
and
communion
sacrifices
on
it
Jehovah
will
exact
the
penalty
24
No
it
was
because
of
another
concern
that
we
did
this
for
we
said
In
the
future
your
sons
will
say
to
our
sons
What
do
you
have
to
do
with
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
25
Jehovah
has
put
the
Jordan
as
a
boundary
between
us
and
you
the
Reubenites
and
the
Gadites
You
have
no
share
in
Jehovah
And
your
sons
will
hinder
our
sons
from
worshipping
Jehovah
26
So
we
said
Let
us
by
all
means
take
action
by
building
an
altar
not
for
burnt
offerings
or
sacrifices
27
but
to
be
a
witness
between
you
and
us
and
our
descendants
after
us
that
we
will
carry
out
our
service
to
Jehovah
before
him
with
our
burnt
offerings
and
our
sacrifices
and
our
communion
sacrifices
so
that
your
sons
may
not
say
to
our
sons
in
the
future
You
have
no
share
in
Jehovah
28
So
we
said
If
they
should
say
that
to
us
and
to
our
descendants
in
the
future
we
will
then
say
See
the
replica
of
Jehovahs
altar
that
our
forefathers
made
not
for
burnt
offerings
or
sacrifices
but
to
be
a
witness
between
you
and
us
29
It
is
unthinkable
for
us
to
rebel
against
Jehovah
and
to
turn
back
today
from
following
Jehovah
by
building
an
altar
for
burnt
offerings
grain
offerings
and
sacrifices
other
than
the
altar
of
Jehovah
our
God
that
is
before
his
tabernacle
30
When
Phinehas
the
priest
the
chieftains
of
the
assembly
and
the
heads
of
the
thousands
of
Israel
who
were
with
him
heard
the
words
that
the
descendants
of
Reuben
Gad
and
Manasseh
spoke
they
were
satisfied
31
So
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
priest
said
to
the
descendants
of
Reuben
Gad
and
Manasseh
Today
we
know
that
Jehovah
is
among
us
because
you
have
not
committed
this
act
of
unfaithfulness
against
Jehovah
Now
you
have
saved
the
Israelites
out
of
the
hand
of
Jehovah
32
Then
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
priest
and
the
chieftains
returned
from
the
Reubenites
and
the
Gadites
in
the
land
of
Gilead
to
the
land
of
Canaan
and
they
brought
back
word
to
the
other
Israelites
33
And
the
Israelites
were
satisfied
with
the
report
The
Israelites
then
praised
God
and
they
said
nothing
more
about
going
to
war
against
the
Reubenites
and
the
Gadites
to
destroy
the
land
in
which
they
were
dwelling
34
So
the
Reubenites
and
the
Gadites
named
the
altar
because
it
is
a
witness
between
us
that
Jehovah
is
the
true
God
1
Many
days
after
Jehovah
had
given
Israel
rest
from
all
its
surrounding
enemies
when
Joshua
was
old
and
advanced
in
years
2
Joshua
summoned
all
Israel
its
elders
its
heads
its
judges
and
its
officers
and
he
said
to
them
I
have
grown
old
I
am
advanced
in
years
3
And
you
have
seen
for
yourselves
all
that
Jehovah
your
God
did
to
all
these
nations
in
your
behalf
because
Jehovah
your
God
was
the
one
who
was
fighting
for
you
4
See
I
assigned
to
you
by
lot
the
land
of
the
nations
that
remain
as
an
inheritance
for
your
tribes
as
well
as
that
of
all
the
nations
that
I
destroyed
from
the
Jordan
to
the
Great
Sea
on
the
west
5
And
Jehovah
your
God
was
the
one
who
kept
thrusting
them
away
from
before
you
and
he
drove
them
out
for
you
and
you
took
possession
of
their
land
just
as
Jehovah
your
God
promised
you
6
Now
you
must
be
very
courageous
to
observe
and
carry
out
all
that
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
Law
of
Moses
by
never
deviating
from
it
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
7
by
never
mingling
with
these
nations
that
remain
with
you
You
must
not
even
mention
the
names
of
their
gods
nor
swear
by
them
and
you
must
never
serve
them
nor
bow
down
to
them
8
But
you
must
stick
to
Jehovah
your
God
just
as
you
have
done
down
to
this
day
9
Jehovah
will
drive
away
great
and
mighty
nations
from
before
you
for
not
a
man
has
been
able
to
stand
before
you
to
this
day
10
Just
one
man
of
you
will
chase
a
thousand
because
Jehovah
your
God
is
fighting
for
you
just
as
he
promised
you
11
So
be
on
guard
constantly
by
loving
Jehovah
your
God
12
But
if
you
should
turn
back
at
all
and
stick
to
what
is
left
of
these
nations
that
remain
with
you
and
you
form
marriage
alliances
with
them
and
associate
with
them
and
they
with
you
13
you
should
know
for
sure
that
Jehovah
your
God
will
not
continue
to
drive
out
these
nations
for
you
They
will
become
a
trap
and
a
snare
and
a
scourge
on
your
flanks
and
thorns
in
your
eyes
until
you
have
perished
from
this
good
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
14
Now
look
I
am
about
to
die
and
you
well
know
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul
that
not
one
word
out
of
all
the
good
promises
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
spoken
to
you
has
failed
They
have
all
come
true
for
you
Not
one
word
of
them
has
failed
15
But
just
as
all
the
good
promises
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
spoken
to
you
have
come
upon
you
so
Jehovah
will
bring
upon
you
all
the
calamity
that
he
promised
and
will
annihilate
you
from
this
good
land
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
given
you
16
If
you
violate
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
your
God
that
he
commanded
you
to
keep
and
if
you
go
and
serve
other
gods
and
bow
down
to
them
then
Jehovahs
anger
will
blaze
against
you
and
you
will
quickly
perish
from
the
good
land
that
he
has
given
you
1
Joshua
then
assembled
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
together
at
Shechem
and
summoned
the
elders
of
Israel
its
heads
its
judges
and
its
officers
and
they
stood
before
the
true
God
2
Joshua
said
to
all
the
people
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
It
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
River
that
your
forefathers
lived
a
long
time
ago—Terah
the
father
of
Abraham
and
the
father
of
Nahor—and
they
used
to
serve
other
gods
3
In
time
I
took
your
forefather
Abraham
from
the
other
side
of
the
River
and
had
him
walk
through
all
the
land
of
Canaan
and
made
his
offspring
many
I
gave
him
Isaac
4
then
to
Isaac
I
gave
Jacob
and
Esau
Later
to
Esau
I
gave
Mount
Seir
as
his
possession
and
Jacob
and
his
sons
went
down
to
Egypt
5
I
later
sent
Moses
and
Aaron
and
I
plagued
Egypt
with
what
I
did
among
them
and
then
I
brought
you
out
6
When
I
was
bringing
your
fathers
out
of
Egypt
and
you
came
to
the
sea
the
Egyptians
were
chasing
after
your
fathers
with
war
chariots
and
cavalrymen
as
far
as
the
Red
Sea
7
They
began
to
cry
out
to
Jehovah
so
he
placed
a
darkness
between
you
and
the
Egyptians
and
brought
the
sea
over
them
and
covered
them
and
your
own
eyes
saw
what
I
did
in
Egypt
Then
you
dwelled
in
the
wilderness
many
years
8
And
I
brought
you
to
the
land
of
the
Amorites
who
were
dwelling
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
and
they
fought
against
you
But
I
gave
them
into
your
hand
so
that
you
could
take
possession
of
their
land
and
I
annihilated
them
from
before
you
9
Then
Balak
son
of
Zippor
the
king
of
Moab
rose
up
and
fought
against
Israel
So
he
summoned
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
to
curse
you
10
But
I
would
not
listen
to
Balaam
So
he
blessed
you
repeatedly
and
I
rescued
you
from
his
hand
11
Then
you
crossed
the
Jordan
and
came
to
Jericho
And
the
leaders
of
Jericho
the
Amorites
the
Perizzites
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Girgashites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
fought
against
you
but
I
gave
them
into
your
hand
12
So
I
sent
the
feeling
of
dejection
ahead
of
you
and
it
drove
them
out
from
before
you—two
kings
of
the
Amorites
It
was
not
by
your
sword
and
not
by
your
bow
13
Thus
I
gave
you
a
land
for
which
you
had
not
toiled
and
cities
that
you
had
not
built
and
you
settled
in
them
You
are
eating
from
vineyards
and
olive
groves
that
you
did
not
plant
14
Therefore
fear
Jehovah
and
serve
him
with
integrity
and
faithfulness
and
remove
the
gods
that
your
forefathers
served
on
the
other
side
of
the
River
and
in
Egypt
and
serve
Jehovah
15
Now
if
it
seems
bad
to
you
to
serve
Jehovah
choose
for
yourselves
today
whom
you
will
serve
whether
the
gods
that
your
forefathers
served
on
the
other
side
of
the
River
or
the
gods
of
the
Amorites
in
whose
land
you
are
dwelling
But
as
for
me
and
my
household
we
will
serve
Jehovah
16
At
this
the
people
answered
It
is
unthinkable
for
us
to
abandon
Jehovah
and
to
serve
other
gods
17
It
is
Jehovah
our
God
who
brought
us
and
our
fathers
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
out
of
the
house
of
slavery
and
who
performed
these
great
signs
before
our
eyes
and
who
kept
guarding
us
the
entire
way
in
which
we
walked
and
among
all
the
peoples
through
whom
we
passed
18
Jehovah
drove
out
all
the
peoples
including
the
Amorites
who
lived
in
the
land
before
us
Therefore
we
too
will
serve
Jehovah
because
he
is
our
God
19
Then
Joshua
said
to
the
people
You
are
not
able
to
serve
Jehovah
for
he
is
a
holy
God
he
is
a
God
who
requires
exclusive
devotion
He
will
not
pardon
your
transgressions
and
your
sins
20
If
you
abandon
Jehovah
and
serve
foreign
gods
he
will
also
turn
against
you
and
exterminate
you
after
doing
good
for
you
21
But
the
people
said
to
Joshua
No
but
we
will
serve
Jehovah
22
So
Joshua
said
to
the
people
You
are
witnesses
against
yourselves
that
of
your
own
accord
you
have
chosen
for
yourselves
to
serve
Jehovah
To
this
they
said
We
are
witnesses
23
Therefore
remove
the
foreign
gods
that
are
among
you
and
incline
your
hearts
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
24
The
people
said
to
Joshua
We
will
serve
Jehovah
our
God
and
we
will
obey
his
voice
25
So
Joshua
made
a
covenant
with
the
people
on
that
day
and
established
a
regulation
and
a
ruling
for
them
in
Shechem
26
Then
Joshua
wrote
these
words
in
the
book
of
Gods
Law
and
took
a
great
stone
and
set
it
up
under
the
large
tree
that
is
by
the
sanctuary
of
Jehovah
27
Joshua
went
on
to
say
to
all
the
people
Look
This
stone
will
serve
as
a
witness
against
us
because
it
has
heard
everything
Jehovah
said
to
us
and
it
will
serve
as
a
witness
against
you
so
that
you
may
not
deny
your
God
28
With
that
Joshua
sent
the
people
away
each
one
to
his
inheritance
29
After
these
things
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
the
servant
of
Jehovah
died
at
the
age
of
110
30
So
they
buried
him
in
the
territory
of
his
inheritance
in
Timnath-serah
which
is
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
north
of
Mount
Gaash
31
Israel
continued
to
serve
Jehovah
all
the
days
of
Joshua
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
who
outlived
Joshua
and
who
had
known
all
of
Jehovahs
deeds
in
behalf
of
Israel
32
The
bones
of
Joseph
which
the
Israelites
had
brought
up
out
of
Egypt
were
buried
in
Shechem
in
the
portion
of
the
field
that
Jacob
had
acquired
from
the
sons
of
Hamor
Shechems
father
for
100
pieces
of
money
and
it
became
the
inheritance
of
the
sons
of
Joseph
33
Also
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
died
So
they
buried
him
in
the
Hill
of
Phinehas
his
son
which
had
been
given
to
him
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
1
After
the
death
of
Joshua
the
Israelites
inquired
of
Jehovah
Who
of
us
will
go
up
first
to
fight
against
the
Canaanites
2
Jehovah
replied
Judah
will
go
up
Look
I
am
giving
the
land
into
his
hand
3
Then
Judah
said
to
his
brother
Simeon
Come
up
with
me
into
my
assigned
territory
to
fight
against
the
Canaanites
Then
I
will
go
with
you
into
your
assigned
territory
So
Simeon
went
with
him
4
When
Judah
went
up
Jehovah
gave
the
Canaanites
and
the
Perizzites
into
their
hands
and
they
defeated
10000
men
in
Bezek
5
They
found
Adoni-bezek
in
Bezek
and
there
they
fought
against
him
and
defeated
the
Canaanites
and
the
Perizzites
6
When
Adoni-bezek
fled
they
chased
him
and
caught
him
and
cut
off
his
thumbs
and
his
big
toes
7
Then
Adoni-bezek
said
There
are
70
kings
whose
thumbs
and
big
toes
were
cut
off
and
who
are
picking
up
food
under
my
table
Just
as
I
have
done
so
God
has
repaid
me
After
that
they
brought
him
to
Jerusalem
and
he
died
there
8
Furthermore
the
men
of
Judah
fought
against
Jerusalem
and
captured
it
they
struck
it
with
the
sword
and
set
the
city
on
fire
9
Afterward
the
men
of
Judah
went
down
to
fight
against
the
Canaanites
inhabiting
the
mountainous
region
and
the
Negeb
and
the
Shephelah
10
So
Judah
marched
against
the
Canaanites
who
were
dwelling
in
Hebron
the
name
of
Hebron
was
previously
Kiriath-arba
and
they
struck
down
Sheshai
Ahiman
and
Talmai
11
They
marched
from
there
against
the
inhabitants
of
Debir
The
name
of
Debir
was
previously
Kiriath-sepher
12
Then
Caleb
said
To
the
man
who
strikes
Kiriath-sepher
and
captures
it
I
will
give
my
daughter
Achsah
as
a
wife
13
And
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz
Calebs
younger
brother
captured
it
So
he
gave
him
his
daughter
Achsah
as
a
wife
14
While
she
was
going
home
she
urged
him
to
ask
her
father
for
a
field
Then
she
dismounted
from
her
donkey
Caleb
asked
her
What
do
you
want
15
She
said
to
him
Please
grant
me
a
blessing
for
you
have
given
me
a
piece
of
land
in
the
south
give
me
also
Gulloth-maim
So
Caleb
gave
her
Upper
Gulloth
and
Lower
Gulloth
16
And
the
descendants
of
the
Kenite
Moses
father-in-law
came
up
from
the
city
of
palm
trees
with
the
people
of
Judah
to
the
wilderness
of
Judah
south
of
Arad
They
went
there
and
settled
among
the
people
17
But
Judah
marched
on
with
his
brother
Simeon
and
they
attacked
the
Canaanites
inhabiting
Zephath
and
devoted
it
to
destruction
So
they
named
the
city
Hormah
18
Then
Judah
captured
Gaza
and
its
territory
Ashkelon
and
its
territory
and
Ekron
and
its
territory
19
Jehovah
was
with
Judah
and
they
took
possession
of
the
mountainous
region
but
they
could
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
the
plain
because
they
had
war
chariots
with
iron
scythes
20
They
gave
Hebron
to
Caleb
just
as
Moses
had
promised
and
he
drove
out
from
there
the
three
sons
of
Anak
21
But
the
Benjaminites
did
not
drive
out
the
Jebusites
inhabiting
Jerusalem
so
the
Jebusites
continue
dwelling
with
the
Benjaminites
in
Jerusalem
down
to
this
day
22
Meantime
the
house
of
Joseph
went
up
against
Bethel
and
Jehovah
was
with
them
23
The
house
of
Joseph
was
spying
on
Bethel
incidentally
the
name
of
the
city
was
previously
Luz
24
and
the
spies
saw
a
man
going
out
of
the
city
So
they
said
to
him
Show
us
please
the
way
into
the
city
and
we
will
treat
you
kindly
25
So
the
man
showed
them
the
way
into
the
city
and
they
struck
the
city
with
the
sword
but
they
let
the
man
and
all
his
family
go
free
26
The
man
went
to
the
land
of
the
Hittites
and
built
a
city
and
named
it
Luz
which
is
its
name
to
this
day
27
Manasseh
did
not
take
possession
of
Beth-shean
and
its
dependent
towns
Taanach
and
its
dependent
towns
the
inhabitants
of
Dor
and
its
dependent
towns
the
inhabitants
of
Ibleam
and
its
dependent
towns
and
the
inhabitants
of
Megiddo
and
its
dependent
towns
The
Canaanites
persisted
in
dwelling
in
this
land
28
When
Israel
grew
stronger
they
subjected
the
Canaanites
to
forced
labor
but
they
did
not
drive
them
out
completely
29
Nor
did
Ephraim
drive
out
the
Canaanites
who
were
dwelling
in
Gezer
The
Canaanites
continued
to
dwell
among
them
in
Gezer
30
Zebulun
did
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Kitron
and
the
inhabitants
of
Nahalol
The
Canaanites
continued
to
dwell
among
them
and
were
subjected
to
forced
labor
31
Asher
did
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Acco
and
the
inhabitants
of
Sidon
Ahlab
Achzib
Helbah
Aphik
and
Rehob
32
So
the
Asherites
continued
to
dwell
among
the
Canaanites
inhabiting
the
land
because
they
did
not
drive
them
out
33
Naphtali
did
not
drive
out
the
inhabitants
of
Beth-shemesh
and
the
inhabitants
of
Beth-anath
but
they
continued
to
dwell
among
the
Canaanites
inhabiting
the
land
The
inhabitants
of
Beth-shemesh
and
Beth-anath
became
forced
laborers
for
them
34
The
Amorites
confined
the
Danites
to
the
mountainous
region
for
they
would
not
let
them
come
down
into
the
plain
35
So
the
Amorites
persisted
in
dwelling
in
Mount
Heres
Aijalon
and
Shaalbim
But
when
the
power
of
the
house
of
Joseph
increased
they
were
forced
into
hard
labor
36
The
territory
of
the
Amorites
was
from
the
ascent
of
Akrabbim
from
Sela
upward
1
Then
Jehovahs
angel
went
up
from
Gilgal
to
Bochim
and
said
I
brought
you
up
out
of
Egypt
into
the
land
about
which
I
swore
to
your
forefathers
Furthermore
I
said
I
will
never
break
my
covenant
with
you
2
For
your
part
you
must
not
make
a
covenant
with
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
and
you
should
pull
down
their
altars
But
you
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
Why
have
you
done
this
3
That
is
why
I
also
said
I
will
not
drive
them
away
from
before
you
and
they
will
ensnare
you
and
their
gods
will
lure
you
away
4
When
Jehovahs
angel
spoke
these
words
to
all
the
Israelites
the
people
began
to
weep
loudly
5
So
they
named
that
place
Bochim
and
they
sacrificed
there
to
Jehovah
6
When
Joshua
sent
the
people
away
each
of
the
Israelites
went
to
his
inheritance
to
take
possession
of
the
land
7
The
people
continued
to
serve
Jehovah
all
the
days
of
Joshua
and
all
the
days
of
the
elders
who
outlived
Joshua
and
who
had
seen
all
of
Jehovahs
great
deeds
in
behalf
of
Israel
8
Then
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
the
servant
of
Jehovah
died
at
the
age
of
110
9
So
they
buried
him
in
the
territory
of
his
inheritance
in
Timnath-heres
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
north
of
Mount
Gaash
10
All
that
generation
were
gathered
to
their
ancestors
and
another
generation
arose
after
them
that
did
not
know
Jehovah
or
what
he
had
done
for
Israel
11
So
the
Israelites
did
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
served
the
Baals
12
Thus
they
abandoned
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
fathers
who
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
And
they
followed
other
gods
the
gods
of
the
peoples
who
were
all
around
them
and
they
bowed
down
to
them
and
offended
Jehovah
13
They
abandoned
Jehovah
and
served
Baal
and
the
Ashtoreth
images
14
At
this
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
Israel
so
he
handed
them
over
to
plunderers
who
pillaged
them
He
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
the
enemies
around
them
and
they
were
no
longer
able
to
hold
their
own
against
their
enemies
15
Wherever
they
went
the
hand
of
Jehovah
was
against
them
bringing
disaster
on
them
just
as
Jehovah
had
said
and
just
as
Jehovah
had
sworn
to
them
and
they
were
in
great
distress
16
So
Jehovah
would
raise
up
judges
who
would
save
them
from
the
hand
of
their
plunderers
17
But
they
refused
to
listen
even
to
the
judges
and
would
prostitute
themselves
to
other
gods
and
bow
down
to
them
They
quickly
turned
aside
from
the
way
in
which
their
forefathers
had
walked
those
who
had
obeyed
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
They
failed
to
do
that
18
Whenever
Jehovah
did
raise
up
judges
for
them
Jehovah
would
be
with
the
judge
and
save
them
from
the
hand
of
their
enemies
all
the
days
of
the
judge
for
Jehovah
was
moved
to
pity
over
their
groaning
caused
by
those
who
oppressed
them
and
those
who
were
treating
them
abusively
19
But
when
the
judge
died
they
would
again
act
more
corruptly
than
their
fathers
by
following
other
gods
serving
them
and
bowing
down
to
them
They
did
not
abandon
their
practices
and
their
stubborn
behavior
20
Finally
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
Israel
and
he
said
Because
this
nation
has
violated
my
covenant
that
I
commanded
their
forefathers
and
they
have
disobeyed
me
21
I
for
my
part
will
not
drive
out
from
before
them
even
one
of
the
nations
that
Joshua
left
behind
when
he
died
22
This
is
to
test
whether
Israel
will
keep
Jehovahs
way
by
walking
in
it
as
their
fathers
did
23
So
Jehovah
allowed
these
nations
to
remain
He
did
not
drive
them
out
quickly
and
he
did
not
give
them
into
Joshuas
hand
1
These
are
the
nations
that
Jehovah
allowed
to
remain
so
that
they
could
test
all
those
of
Israel
who
had
not
experienced
any
of
the
wars
of
Canaan
2
this
was
so
that
succeeding
generations
of
Israelites
would
experience
war
those
who
had
not
experienced
such
things
before
3
the
five
lords
of
the
Philistines
and
all
the
Canaanites
the
Sidonians
and
the
Hivites
inhabiting
Mount
Lebanon
from
Mount
Baal-hermon
as
far
as
Lebo-hamath
4
They
served
as
a
means
of
testing
Israel
to
determine
whether
Israel
would
obey
Jehovahs
commandments
that
he
had
given
their
fathers
through
Moses
5
So
the
Israelites
lived
among
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Amorites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
6
They
would
take
their
daughters
as
wives
and
their
own
daughters
they
gave
to
their
sons
and
they
began
serving
their
gods
7
So
the
Israelites
did
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
and
they
forgot
Jehovah
their
God
and
were
serving
the
Baals
and
the
sacred
poles
8
At
this
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
Israel
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
Cushan-rishathaim
the
king
of
Mesopotamia
The
Israelites
served
Cushan-rishathaim
for
eight
years
9
When
the
Israelites
called
to
Jehovah
for
help
Jehovah
raised
up
a
savior
to
rescue
the
Israelites
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz
the
younger
brother
of
Caleb
10
The
spirit
of
Jehovah
came
upon
him
and
he
became
the
judge
of
Israel
When
he
went
out
to
battle
Jehovah
gave
Cushan-rishathaim
the
king
of
Mesopotamia
into
his
hand
so
that
he
prevailed
over
Cushan-rishathaim
11
After
that
the
land
had
rest
for
40
years
Then
Othniel
the
son
of
Kenaz
died
12
And
once
again
the
Israelites
began
doing
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
So
Jehovah
let
Eglon
the
king
of
Moab
prevail
over
Israel
because
they
did
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
13
Furthermore
he
brought
against
them
the
Ammonites
and
the
Amalekites
They
attacked
Israel
and
captured
the
city
of
palm
trees
14
The
Israelites
served
Eglon
the
king
of
Moab
for
18
years
15
Then
the
Israelites
called
to
Jehovah
for
help
so
Jehovah
raised
up
for
them
a
savior
Ehud
the
son
of
Gera
a
Benjaminite
who
was
left-handed
In
time
the
Israelites
sent
tribute
through
him
to
Eglon
the
king
of
Moab
16
Meanwhile
Ehud
made
for
himself
a
two-edged
sword
a
cubit
long
and
he
strapped
it
underneath
his
garment
on
his
right
thigh
17
He
then
presented
the
tribute
to
Eglon
the
king
of
Moab
Now
Eglon
was
a
very
fat
man
18
When
Ehud
finished
presenting
the
tribute
he
sent
away
the
people
who
had
carried
the
tribute
19
But
after
reaching
the
carved
images
at
Gilgal
he
himself
went
back
and
said
I
have
a
secret
message
for
you
O
king
So
the
king
said
Silence
With
that
all
his
attendants
left
him
20
So
Ehud
came
to
him
as
he
was
sitting
alone
in
his
cool
roof
chamber
Then
Ehud
said
I
have
a
message
from
God
for
you
So
he
rose
up
from
his
throne
21
Then
Ehud
drew
the
sword
from
his
right
thigh
with
his
left
hand
and
plunged
it
into
his
belly
22
The
handle
went
in
after
the
blade
and
the
fat
closed
in
over
the
blade
for
he
did
not
draw
the
sword
out
of
his
belly
and
the
fecal
matter
came
out
23
Ehud
went
out
through
the
porch
closing
the
doors
of
the
roof
chamber
behind
him
and
locking
them
24
After
he
left
the
servants
returned
and
saw
that
the
doors
of
the
roof
chamber
were
locked
So
they
said
He
must
be
relieving
himself
in
the
cool
interior
room
25
They
kept
waiting
until
they
were
embarrassed
but
when
they
saw
that
he
was
still
not
opening
the
doors
of
the
roof
chamber
they
took
the
key
and
opened
them
and
saw
their
lord
fallen
to
the
floor
dead
26
Ehud
escaped
while
they
were
lingering
and
he
passed
by
the
carved
images
and
made
it
safely
to
Seirah
27
When
he
arrived
he
sounded
the
horn
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
and
the
Israelites
went
down
out
of
the
mountainous
region
with
him
at
their
head
28
Then
he
said
to
them
Follow
me
because
Jehovah
has
given
your
enemies
the
Moabites
into
your
hand
So
they
followed
him
and
captured
the
fords
of
the
Jordan
against
the
Moabites
and
they
did
not
allow
anyone
to
cross
29
At
that
time
they
struck
down
about
10000
Moabites
all
strong
and
valiant
men
not
a
single
one
escaped
30
So
Moab
was
subdued
on
that
day
under
Israels
hand
and
the
land
had
rest
for
80
years
31
After
him
was
Shamgar
the
son
of
Anath
who
struck
down
600
Philistine
men
with
a
cattle
goad
he
too
saved
Israel
1
But
after
Ehud
died
the
Israelites
again
did
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
2
So
Jehovah
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
Jabin
the
king
of
Canaan
who
reigned
in
Hazor
The
chief
of
his
army
was
Sisera
who
lived
in
Harosheth
of
the
nations
3
The
Israelites
cried
out
to
Jehovah
because
Jabin
had
900
war
chariots
with
iron
scythes
and
he
harshly
oppressed
the
Israelites
for
20
years
4
Now
Deborah
a
prophetess
the
wife
of
Lappidoth
was
judging
Israel
at
that
time
5
She
used
to
sit
under
Deborahs
palm
tree
between
Ramah
and
Bethel
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
the
Israelites
would
go
up
to
her
for
judgment
6
She
sent
for
Barak
the
son
of
Abinoam
out
of
Kedesh-naphtali
and
said
to
him
Has
not
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
given
the
command
Go
and
march
to
Mount
Tabor
and
take
10000
men
of
Naphtali
and
Zebulun
with
you
7
I
will
bring
to
you
Sisera
the
chief
of
Jabins
army
along
with
his
war
chariots
and
his
troops
to
the
stream
of
Kishon
and
I
will
give
him
into
your
hand
8
At
this
Barak
said
to
her
If
you
go
with
me
I
will
go
but
if
you
do
not
go
with
me
I
will
not
go
9
To
this
she
said
I
will
certainly
go
with
you
However
the
campaign
you
are
going
on
will
not
bring
you
glory
for
it
will
be
into
the
hand
of
a
woman
that
Jehovah
will
give
Sisera
Then
Deborah
got
up
and
went
with
Barak
to
Kedesh
10
Barak
summoned
Zebulun
and
Naphtali
to
Kedesh
and
10000
men
followed
his
steps
Deborah
also
went
up
with
him
11
Incidentally
Heber
the
Kenite
had
separated
from
the
Kenites
the
descendants
of
Hobab
Moses
father-in-law
and
his
tent
was
pitched
near
the
big
tree
in
Zaanannim
which
is
at
Kedesh
12
They
reported
to
Sisera
that
Barak
the
son
of
Abinoam
had
gone
up
to
Mount
Tabor
13
At
once
Sisera
assembled
all
his
war
chariots—900
chariots
with
iron
scythes—and
all
the
troops
that
were
with
him
from
Harosheth
of
the
nations
to
go
to
the
stream
of
Kishon
14
Deborah
now
said
to
Barak
Rise
up
for
this
is
the
day
that
Jehovah
will
give
Sisera
into
your
hand
Is
Jehovah
not
going
out
before
you
And
Barak
descended
from
Mount
Tabor
with
10000
men
following
him
15
Then
Jehovah
threw
Sisera
and
all
his
war
chariots
and
all
the
army
into
confusion
before
the
sword
of
Barak
Finally
Sisera
got
down
from
his
chariot
and
fled
on
foot
16
Barak
chased
after
the
war
chariots
and
the
army
as
far
as
Harosheth
of
the
nations
So
Siseras
whole
army
fell
by
the
sword
not
even
one
remained
17
But
Sisera
fled
on
foot
to
the
tent
of
Jael
the
wife
of
Heber
the
Kenite
for
there
was
peace
between
Jabin
the
king
of
Hazor
and
the
house
of
Heber
the
Kenite
18
Then
Jael
came
out
to
meet
Sisera
and
said
to
him
Come
in
my
lord
come
in
here
Do
not
be
afraid
So
he
went
into
her
tent
and
she
covered
him
with
a
blanket
19
Then
he
said
to
her
Give
me
please
a
little
water
to
drink
for
I
am
thirsty
So
she
opened
a
skin
bottle
of
milk
and
gave
him
a
drink
after
which
she
again
covered
him
20
He
told
her
Stand
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
and
if
anybody
comes
and
asks
you
Is
there
a
man
here
say
No
21
But
Jael
the
wife
of
Heber
took
a
tent
pin
and
a
hammer
in
her
hand
Then
while
he
was
fast
asleep
and
exhausted
she
stealthily
approached
him
and
drove
the
pin
through
his
temples
and
beat
it
into
the
ground
and
he
died
22
Barak
went
there
in
pursuit
of
Sisera
and
Jael
now
came
out
to
meet
him
and
said
Come
and
I
will
show
you
the
man
you
are
looking
for
He
went
in
with
her
and
saw
Sisera
lying
dead
with
the
tent
pin
through
his
temples
23
So
on
that
day
God
subdued
Jabin
the
king
of
Canaan
before
the
Israelites
24
The
hand
of
the
Israelites
came
down
harder
and
harder
against
Jabin
the
king
of
Canaan
until
they
destroyed
Jabin
the
king
of
Canaan
1
On
that
day
Deborah
along
with
Barak
the
son
of
Abinoam
sang
this
song

2
Because
of
the
unbound
hair
in
Israel
Because
of
the
peoples
volunteering
Praise
Jehovah

3
Listen
you
kings
Give
ear
you
rulers
To
Jehovah
I
will
sing
I
will
sing
praises
to
Jehovah
Israels
God

4
Jehovah
when
you
went
out
from
Seir
When
you
marched
out
of
the
territory
of
Edom
The
earth
shook
and
the
heavens
poured
The
clouds
poured
down
water

5
Mountains
melted
before
the
face
of
Jehovah
Even
Sinai
before
the
face
of
Jehovah
Israels
God

6
In
the
days
of
Shamgar
the
son
of
Anath
In
the
days
of
Jael
the
roads
were
deserted
Travelers
kept
to
the
back
roads

7
The
villagers
in
Israel
were
no
more
They
were
no
more
until
I
Deborah
rose
up
Until
I
arose
as
a
mother
in
Israel

8
They
chose
new
gods
Then
there
was
war
in
the
gates
A
shield
could
not
be
seen
nor
a
lance
Among
40000
in
Israel

9
My
heart
is
with
the
commanders
of
Israel
Who
went
as
volunteers
with
the
people
Praise
Jehovah
10
You
riders
on
tawny
donkeys
You
who
sit
on
fine
carpets
And
you
who
walk
on
the
road
Consider
11
The
voices
of
the
water
distributors
were
heard
at
the
watering
places
There
they
were
recounting
the
righteous
acts
of
Jehovah
The
righteous
acts
of
his
villagers
in
Israel
Then
Jehovahs
people
went
down
to
the
gates
12
Awake
awake
O
Deborah
Awake
awake
sing
a
song
Rise
up
Barak
Lead
your
captives
away
you
son
of
Abinoam
13
Then
those
who
were
left
came
down
to
the
nobles
Jehovahs
people
came
down
to
me
against
the
mighty
14
Out
of
Ephraim
was
their
origin
those
in
the
valley
They
are
following
you
O
Benjamin
among
your
peoples
From
Machir
the
commanders
went
down
And
from
Zebulun
those
who
bear
the
recruiters
staff
15
The
princes
in
Issachar
were
with
Deborah
As
was
Issachar
so
was
Barak
Into
the
valley
plain
he
was
sent
on
foot
Among
the
divisions
of
Reuben
there
was
intense
heart-searching
16
Why
did
you
sit
down
between
the
two
saddlebags
Listening
to
them
playing
their
pipes
for
the
flocks
For
the
divisions
of
Reuben
there
was
intense
heart-searching
17
Gilead
remained
beyond
the
Jordan
And
Dan
why
did
he
stay
with
the
ships
Asher
sat
idle
at
the
seashore
And
by
his
harbors
he
remained
18
Zebulun
was
a
people
who
risked
their
lives
to
the
point
of
death
Naphtali
also
on
the
open
heights
19
Kings
came
they
fought
The
kings
of
Canaan
then
foughtIn
Taanach
by
the
waters
of
Megiddo
No
spoil
of
silver
did
they
take
20
From
heaven
the
stars
fought
From
their
orbits
they
fought
against
Sisera
21
The
torrent
of
Kishon
washed
them
away
The
ancient
torrent
the
torrent
of
Kishon
You
trampled
down
the
powerful
O
my
soul
22
Then
the
hooves
of
horses
poundedAs
his
stallions
galloped
furiously
23
Curse
Meroz

said
the
angel
of
Jehovah
Yes
curse
its
inhabitants
For
they
did
not
come
to
the
assistance
of
Jehovah
To
the
assistance
of
Jehovah
with
the
mighty
ones
24
Most
blessed
of
women
is
JaelThe
wife
of
Heber
the
Kenite
She
is
most
blessed
of
women
living
in
tents
25
He
asked
for
water
she
gave
him
milk
In
a
majestic
banquet
bowl
she
offered
curdled
milk
26
With
her
hand
she
reached
for
the
tent
pin
Her
right
hand
for
the
workmans
mallet
And
she
hammered
Sisera
she
crushed
his
head
And
she
smashed
and
pierced
his
temples
27
Between
her
feet
he
collapsed
he
fell
and
lay
still
Between
her
feet
he
collapsed
and
fell
Where
he
collapsed
there
he
fell
defeated
28
From
the
window
a
woman
looked
out
Siseras
mother
peered
out
from
the
lattice
Why
is
his
chariot
delayed
in
coming
Why
are
the
hoofbeats
of
his
chariots
so
late
29
The
wisest
of
her
noble
ladies
would
answer
her
Yes
she
too
would
repeat
to
herself
30
They
must
be
dividing
the
spoil
they
found
A
girl
two
girls
to
every
warrior
Spoil
of
dyed
cloth
for
Sisera
spoil
of
dyed
cloth
An
embroidered
garment
dyed
cloth
two
embroidered
garmentsFor
the
necks
of
the
plunderers
31
So
let
all
your
enemies
perish
O
Jehovah
But
let
those
who
love
you
be
like
the
sun
rising
in
its
glory
And
the
land
had
rest
for
40
years
1
But
the
Israelites
again
did
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
so
Jehovah
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
Midian
for
seven
years
2
The
hand
of
Midian
dominated
over
Israel
Because
of
Midian
the
Israelites
made
hiding
places
for
themselves
in
the
mountains
in
the
caves
and
in
the
places
difficult
to
approach
3
If
Israel
sowed
seed
Midian
and
Amalek
and
the
Easterners
would
attack
them
4
They
would
camp
against
them
and
ruin
the
produce
of
the
land
all
the
way
to
Gaza
and
they
left
nothing
for
Israel
to
eat
and
no
sheep
or
bull
or
donkey
5
For
they
would
come
up
with
their
livestock
and
tents
as
numerous
as
the
locusts
and
they
and
their
camels
could
not
be
numbered
and
they
would
come
into
the
land
to
destroy
it
6
So
Israel
became
greatly
impoverished
on
account
of
Midian
and
the
Israelites
called
to
Jehovah
for
help
7
When
the
Israelites
called
to
Jehovah
for
help
because
of
Midian
8
Jehovah
sent
to
the
Israelites
a
prophet
who
said
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
I
brought
you
up
from
Egypt
and
thus
brought
you
out
of
the
house
of
slavery
9
So
I
rescued
you
from
the
hand
of
Egypt
and
from
all
your
oppressors
and
drove
them
out
from
before
you
and
gave
you
their
land
10
And
I
said
to
you
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
You
must
not
fear
the
gods
of
the
Amorites
in
whose
land
you
are
dwelling
But
you
did
not
obey
me
11
Later
Jehovahs
angel
came
and
sat
under
the
big
tree
that
was
in
Ophrah
which
belonged
to
Joash
the
Abi-ezrite
His
son
Gideon
was
beating
out
wheat
in
the
winepress
in
order
to
hide
it
from
Midian
12
Jehovahs
angel
appeared
to
him
and
said
Jehovah
is
with
you
you
mighty
warrior
13
At
this
Gideon
said
to
him
Pardon
me
my
lord
but
if
Jehovah
is
with
us
why
has
all
of
this
come
upon
us
Where
are
all
his
wonderful
acts
that
our
fathers
related
to
us
saying
Did
Jehovah
not
bring
us
up
out
of
Egypt
Now
Jehovah
has
deserted
us
and
given
us
into
Midians
hand
14
Jehovah
faced
him
and
said
Go
with
the
strength
you
have
and
you
will
save
Israel
out
of
Midians
hand
Is
it
not
I
who
send
you
15
Gideon
answered
him
Pardon
me
Jehovah
How
can
I
save
Israel
Look
My
clan
is
the
least
in
Manasseh
and
I
am
the
most
insignificant
in
my
fathers
house
16
But
Jehovah
said
to
him
Because
I
will
be
with
you
you
will
strike
down
Midian
as
if
they
were
one
man
17
Then
he
said
to
him
If
now
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
show
me
a
sign
that
you
are
the
one
speaking
with
me
18
Please
do
not
depart
from
here
until
I
return
with
my
gift
and
set
it
before
you
So
he
said
I
will
stay
here
until
you
return
19
And
Gideon
went
in
and
prepared
a
young
goat
and
made
unleavened
bread
from
an
ephah
of
flour
He
put
the
meat
in
the
basket
and
the
broth
in
the
cooking
pot
then
he
brought
them
out
to
him
and
served
them
under
the
big
tree
20
The
angel
of
the
true
God
now
said
to
him
Take
the
meat
and
the
unleavened
bread
and
place
them
on
the
big
rock
there
and
pour
out
the
broth
And
he
did
so
21
Then
Jehovahs
angel
stretched
out
the
tip
of
the
staff
that
was
in
his
hand
and
touched
the
meat
and
the
unleavened
bread
and
fire
flared
up
from
the
rock
and
consumed
the
meat
and
the
unleavened
bread
Jehovahs
angel
then
vanished
from
his
sight
22
Gideon
now
realized
that
it
was
Jehovahs
angel
At
once
Gideon
said
Alas
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
for
I
have
seen
Jehovahs
angel
face-to-face
23
But
Jehovah
said
to
him
Peace
be
with
you
Have
no
fear
you
will
not
die
24
So
Gideon
built
an
altar
there
to
Jehovah
and
it
is
called
Jehovah-shalom
down
to
this
day
It
is
still
in
Ophrah
of
the
Abi-ezrites
25
That
night
Jehovah
said
to
him
Take
the
young
bull
that
belongs
to
your
father
the
second
young
bull
that
is
seven
years
old
and
tear
down
the
altar
of
Baal
that
belongs
to
your
father
and
cut
down
the
sacred
pole
next
to
it
26
After
you
build
an
altar
to
Jehovah
your
God
on
top
of
this
stronghold
with
the
row
of
stones
take
the
second
young
bull
and
offer
it
as
a
burnt
offering
on
the
pieces
of
wood
from
the
sacred
pole
that
you
cut
down
27
So
Gideon
took
ten
men
of
his
servants
and
did
just
as
Jehovah
told
him
But
he
feared
the
household
of
his
father
and
the
men
of
the
city
too
much
to
do
it
by
day
so
he
did
it
at
night
28
When
the
men
of
the
city
got
up
early
the
next
morning
they
saw
that
the
altar
of
Baal
had
been
pulled
down
and
the
sacred
pole
beside
it
had
been
cut
down
and
the
second
young
bull
had
been
offered
up
on
the
altar
that
had
been
built
29
They
asked
one
another
Who
did
this
After
they
investigated
they
said
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash
did
this
30
So
the
men
of
the
city
said
to
Joash
Bring
your
son
out
that
he
may
die
because
he
pulled
down
the
altar
of
Baal
and
cut
down
the
sacred
pole
next
to
it
31
Joash
then
said
to
all
those
who
confronted
him
Do
you
have
to
defend
Baal
Do
you
have
to
save
him
Whoever
defends
him
should
be
put
to
death
this
morning
If
he
is
a
god
let
him
defend
himself
since
someone
pulled
down
his
altar
32
And
he
called
Gideon
Jerubbaal
on
that
day
saying
Let
Baal
defend
himself
for
someone
has
pulled
down
his
altar
33
All
Midian
and
Amalek
and
the
Easterners
joined
forces
and
they
crossed
over
into
the
Valley
of
Jezreel
and
camped
34
Then
Jehovahs
spirit
came
upon
Gideon
and
he
sounded
the
horn
and
the
Abi-ezrites
rallied
behind
him
35
He
sent
out
messengers
through
all
of
Manasseh
and
they
too
rallied
behind
him
He
also
sent
out
messengers
through
Asher
Zebulun
and
Naphtali
and
they
came
up
to
meet
him
36
Then
Gideon
said
to
the
true
God
If
you
are
saving
Israel
by
means
of
me
just
as
you
have
promised
37
here
I
am
laying
a
fleece
of
wool
on
the
threshing
floor
If
there
is
dew
on
the
fleece
only
but
all
the
ground
around
it
is
dry
then
I
will
know
that
you
will
save
Israel
by
means
of
me
just
as
you
have
promised
38
And
that
is
how
it
happened
When
he
rose
up
early
the
next
day
and
wrung
the
fleece
he
squeezed
off
enough
dew
from
the
fleece
to
fill
a
large
banquet
bowl
with
water
39
However
Gideon
said
to
the
true
God
Do
not
let
your
anger
burn
against
me
but
let
me
ask
just
once
more
Let
me
please
make
just
one
more
test
with
the
fleece
Please
let
the
fleece
alone
be
dry
while
there
is
dew
all
over
the
ground
40
So
that
is
what
God
did
that
night
only
the
fleece
was
dry
and
there
was
dew
all
over
the
ground
1
Then
Jerubbaal
that
is
Gideon
and
all
the
people
with
him
rose
early
and
encamped
at
the
Spring
of
Harod
while
the
camp
of
Midian
was
north
of
him
at
the
hill
of
Moreh
in
the
valley
plain
2
Jehovah
now
said
to
Gideon
There
are
too
many
people
with
you
for
me
to
give
Midian
into
their
hand
Otherwise
Israel
might
brag
about
itself
against
me
and
say
My
own
hand
saved
me
3
Now
please
announce
in
the
presence
of
the
people
Whoever
is
afraid
and
trembling
let
him
return
home
So
Gideon
put
them
to
the
test
With
that
22000
of
the
people
returned
home
and
10000
remained
4
Still
Jehovah
said
to
Gideon
There
are
yet
too
many
people
Have
them
go
down
to
the
water
so
that
I
may
test
them
for
you
there
When
I
say
to
you
This
one
will
go
with
you

he
will
go
with
you
but
when
I
say
to
you
This
one
will
not
go
along
with
you

he
will
not
go
along
5
So
he
took
the
people
down
to
the
water
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Gideon
Separate
everyone
who
laps
up
the
water
with
his
tongue
just
as
a
dog
laps
from
those
who
bend
down
on
their
knees
to
drink
6
The
number
of
those
lapping
up
the
water
putting
their
hand
to
their
mouth
was
300
men
The
rest
of
the
people
bent
down
on
their
knees
to
drink
7
Jehovah
now
said
to
Gideon
I
will
save
you
with
the
300
men
who
lapped
the
water
and
I
will
give
Midian
into
your
hand
But
let
all
the
other
people
go
back
home
8
So
after
they
took
the
provisions
and
the
horns
from
the
people
he
sent
all
the
other
men
of
Israel
back
home
and
he
kept
only
the
300
men
The
camp
of
Midian
was
below
him
in
the
valley
plain
9
During
that
night
Jehovah
said
to
him
Get
up
attack
the
camp
for
I
have
given
it
into
your
hand
10
But
if
you
are
afraid
to
attack
go
down
to
the
camp
with
Purah
your
attendant
11
Listen
to
what
they
say
and
afterward
you
will
have
the
courage
to
attack
the
camp
At
that
he
and
Purah
his
attendant
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
encamped
army
12
Now
Midian
and
Amalek
and
all
the
Easterners
covered
the
valley
plain
like
a
swarm
of
locusts
and
their
camels
were
without
number
as
many
as
the
grains
of
sand
on
the
seashore
13
Gideon
now
came
and
there
was
a
man
relating
a
dream
to
his
companion
and
he
said
This
is
the
dream
I
had
There
was
a
round
loaf
of
barley
bread
rolling
into
the
camp
of
Midian
It
came
to
a
tent
and
struck
it
so
hard
that
it
collapsed
Yes
it
turned
the
tent
upside
down
and
the
tent
fell
flat
14
At
this
his
companion
said
This
can
only
be
the
sword
of
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash
a
man
of
Israel
God
has
given
Midian
and
all
the
camp
into
his
hand
15
As
soon
as
Gideon
heard
him
relate
the
dream
and
its
interpretation
he
bowed
down
to
worship
After
that
he
returned
to
the
camp
of
Israel
and
said
Get
up
for
Jehovah
has
given
the
camp
of
Midian
into
your
hand
16
Then
he
divided
the
300
men
into
three
bands
and
gave
all
of
them
horns
and
large
empty
jars
with
torches
inside
the
jars
17
Then
he
said
to
them
Watch
me
and
do
exactly
what
I
do
When
I
come
to
the
edge
of
the
camp
you
should
do
just
as
I
do
18
When
I
blow
the
horn
I
and
all
who
are
with
me
you
also
must
blow
the
horns
all
around
the
camp
and
shout
For
Jehovah
and
for
Gideon
19
Gideon
and
the
100
men
who
were
with
him
came
to
the
edge
of
the
camp
at
the
start
of
the
middle
night
watch
just
after
the
sentries
were
posted
They
blew
the
horns
and
smashed
the
large
water
jars
that
were
in
their
hands
20
So
the
three
bands
blew
the
horns
and
shattered
the
large
jars
They
held
the
torches
in
their
left
hands
and
blew
the
horns
in
their
right
hands
and
they
called
out
The
sword
of
Jehovah
and
of
Gideon
21
All
the
while
each
man
stood
in
his
place
all
around
the
camp
and
the
whole
army
ran
away
shouting
as
they
fled
22
The
300
continued
to
blow
the
horns
and
Jehovah
turned
the
sword
of
each
one
against
the
other
throughout
the
camp
and
the
army
fled
as
far
as
Beth-shittah
on
to
Zererah
as
far
as
the
outskirts
of
Abel-meholah
by
Tabbath
23
And
the
men
of
Israel
were
called
together
from
Naphtali
Asher
and
all
of
Manasseh
and
they
chased
after
Midian
24
Gideon
sent
messengers
into
all
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
saying
Go
down
to
attack
Midian
and
capture
the
access
to
the
waters
as
far
as
Beth-barah
and
the
Jordan
So
all
the
men
of
Ephraim
were
gathered
together
and
they
captured
the
waters
as
far
as
Beth-barah
and
the
Jordan
25
They
also
captured
the
two
princes
of
Midian
Oreb
and
Zeeb
they
killed
Oreb
on
the
rock
of
Oreb
and
they
killed
Zeeb
at
the
winepress
of
Zeeb
They
kept
on
pursuing
Midian
and
they
brought
the
heads
of
Oreb
and
Zeeb
to
Gideon
in
the
region
of
the
Jordan
1
Then
the
men
of
Ephraim
said
to
him
What
have
you
done
to
us
Why
did
you
not
call
us
when
you
went
to
fight
against
Midian
And
they
quarreled
bitterly
with
him
2
But
he
said
to
them
What
have
I
done
compared
with
you
Are
not
the
gleanings
of
Ephraim
better
than
the
grape
harvest
of
Abi-ezer
3
It
was
into
your
hand
that
God
gave
Midians
princes
Oreb
and
Zeeb
and
what
have
I
done
compared
with
you
When
he
spoke
this
way
they
calmed
down
4
Gideon
then
came
to
the
Jordan
and
crossed
it
He
and
the
300
men
with
him
were
tired
but
they
kept
up
the
pursuit
5
So
he
said
to
the
men
of
Succoth
Please
give
loaves
of
bread
to
the
people
following
me
for
they
are
tired
and
I
am
chasing
after
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
the
kings
of
Midian
6
But
the
princes
of
Succoth
said
Are
the
palms
of
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
already
in
your
hand
so
that
we
should
give
bread
to
your
army
7
At
this
Gideon
said
Just
for
that
when
Jehovah
gives
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
into
my
hand
I
will
give
you
a
thrashing
with
the
thorns
and
the
briars
of
the
wilderness
8
And
he
went
up
from
there
to
Penuel
and
made
the
same
request
but
the
men
of
Penuel
gave
him
the
same
answer
as
the
men
of
Succoth
9
So
he
said
also
to
the
men
of
Penuel
When
I
return
in
peace
I
will
pull
down
this
tower
10
Now
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
were
in
Karkor
with
their
armies
about
15000
men
These
were
all
who
remained
of
the
entire
army
of
the
Easterners
for
120000
men
armed
with
swords
had
fallen
11
Gideon
continued
up
by
the
way
of
the
tent
dwellers
east
of
Nobah
and
Jogbehah
and
attacked
the
camp
which
was
off
guard
12
When
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
fled
he
pursued
and
captured
the
two
Midianite
kings
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
throwing
the
whole
camp
into
a
panic
13
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash
then
returned
from
the
war
by
way
of
the
pass
that
goes
up
to
Heres
14
En
route
he
captured
and
interrogated
a
young
man
from
Succoth
So
the
young
man
wrote
out
for
him
the
names
of
the
princes
and
elders
of
Succoth
77
men
15
With
that
he
went
to
the
men
of
Succoth
and
said
Here
are
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
about
whom
you
taunted
me
saying
Are
the
palms
of
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
already
in
your
hand
so
that
we
should
give
bread
to
your
exhausted
men
16
Then
he
took
the
elders
of
the
city
and
with
thorns
and
briars
of
the
wilderness
he
taught
the
men
of
Succoth
a
lesson
17
And
he
pulled
down
the
tower
of
Penuel
and
killed
the
men
of
the
city
18
He
asked
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
What
sort
of
men
did
you
kill
in
Tabor
To
this
they
said
They
were
like
you
each
one
looked
like
the
son
of
a
king
19
At
that
he
said
They
were
my
brothers
the
sons
of
my
mother
As
surely
as
Jehovah
lives
if
you
had
spared
their
lives
I
would
not
have
to
kill
you
20
Then
he
said
to
Jether
his
firstborn
Get
up
kill
them
But
the
young
man
did
not
draw
his
sword
he
was
afraid
for
he
was
still
a
young
man
21
So
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
said
Get
up
yourself
and
slay
us
for
a
man
is
judged
by
his
mightiness
So
Gideon
got
up
and
killed
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
and
took
the
crescent-shaped
ornaments
that
were
on
the
necks
of
their
camels
22
Later
the
men
of
Israel
said
to
Gideon
Rule
over
us
you
and
your
son
and
your
grandson
as
well
for
you
saved
us
out
of
the
hand
of
Midian
23
But
Gideon
said
to
them
I
will
not
rule
over
you
nor
will
my
son
rule
over
you
Jehovah
is
the
one
who
will
rule
over
you
24
Gideon
continued
Let
me
make
one
request
of
you
that
each
of
you
give
me
a
nose
ring
from
his
spoil
For
they
had
gold
nose
rings
because
they
were
Ishmaelites
25
They
replied
We
will
surely
give
them
With
that
they
spread
out
a
robe
and
each
man
threw
a
nose
ring
from
his
spoil
on
it
26
The
weight
of
the
gold
nose
rings
that
he
had
requested
amounted
to
1700
gold
shekels
besides
the
crescent-shaped
ornaments
the
pendants
the
purple
wool
garments
worn
by
the
kings
of
Midian
and
the
necklaces
from
the
camels
27
Gideon
made
it
into
an
ephod
and
exhibited
it
in
his
city
Ophrah
and
all
Israel
committed
spiritual
prostitution
with
it
there
and
it
served
as
a
snare
to
Gideon
and
to
his
household
28
Thus
Midian
was
subdued
before
the
Israelites
and
they
did
not
challenge
them
again
and
the
land
had
rest
for
40
years
in
the
days
of
Gideon
29
So
Jerubbaal
the
son
of
Joash
returned
to
his
home
and
stayed
there
30
Gideon
became
father
to
70
sons
for
he
had
many
wives
31
His
concubine
in
Shechem
also
bore
him
a
son
and
he
named
him
Abimelech
32
And
Gideon
the
son
of
Joash
died
at
a
good
old
age
and
was
buried
in
the
tomb
of
Joash
his
father
in
Ophrah
of
the
Abi-ezrites
33
As
soon
as
Gideon
died
the
Israelites
again
committed
spiritual
prostitution
with
the
Baals
and
they
appointed
Baal-berith
as
their
god
34
The
Israelites
did
not
remember
Jehovah
their
God
who
had
rescued
them
from
the
hand
of
all
their
enemies
around
them
35
nor
did
they
show
loyal
love
toward
the
household
of
Jerubbaal
that
is
Gideon
in
return
for
all
the
good
that
he
had
done
for
Israel
1
In
time
Abimelech
the
son
of
Jerubbaal
went
to
his
mothers
brothers
in
Shechem
and
he
said
to
them
and
to
all
the
family
of
his
grandfather
2
Please
ask
all
the
leaders
of
Shechem
Which
is
better
for
you
for
all
70
sons
of
Jerubbaal
to
rule
over
you
or
for
one
man
to
rule
over
you
And
remember
that
I
am
your
own
bone
and
flesh
3
So
his
mothers
brothers
said
this
in
his
behalf
to
all
the
leaders
of
Shechem
and
their
hearts
were
inclined
to
follow
Abimelech
for
they
said
He
is
our
own
brother
4
Then
they
gave
him
70
pieces
of
silver
from
the
house
of
Baal-berith
and
Abimelech
used
it
to
hire
idle
and
insolent
men
to
accompany
him
5
After
that
he
went
to
his
fathers
house
at
Ophrah
and
killed
his
brothers
the
sons
of
Jerubbaal
70
men
on
one
stone
The
only
survivor
was
Jotham
the
youngest
son
of
Jerubbaal
because
he
hid
6
Then
all
the
leaders
of
Shechem
and
all
Beth-millo
gathered
together
and
made
Abimelech
king
close
by
the
big
tree
by
the
pillar
that
was
in
Shechem
7
When
they
reported
it
to
Jotham
he
at
once
went
and
stood
on
the
top
of
Mount
Gerizim
and
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
to
them
Listen
to
me
you
leaders
of
Shechem
and
then
God
will
listen
to
you
8
Once
there
were
trees
that
went
to
anoint
a
king
over
them
So
they
said
to
the
olive
tree
Rule
over
us
9
But
the
olive
tree
said
to
them
Must
I
give
up
my
oil
which
they
use
to
glorify
God
and
men
to
go
and
wave
over
the
other
trees
10
Then
the
trees
said
to
the
fig
tree
Come
and
rule
over
us
11
But
the
fig
tree
said
to
them
Must
I
give
up
my
sweetness
and
my
good
fruitage
to
go
and
wave
over
the
other
trees
12
Next
the
trees
said
to
the
vine
Come
and
rule
over
us
13
The
vine
replied
to
them
Must
I
give
up
my
new
wine
that
makes
God
and
men
rejoice
to
go
and
wave
over
the
trees
14
Finally
all
the
other
trees
said
to
the
bramble
Come
and
rule
over
us
15
At
this
the
bramble
said
to
the
trees
If
you
are
really
anointing
me
as
king
over
you
come
and
seek
refuge
under
my
shadow
But
if
not
let
fire
come
out
of
the
bramble
and
consume
the
cedars
of
Lebanon
16
Now
have
you
acted
sincerely
and
honorably
in
making
Abimelech
king
and
have
you
shown
goodness
toward
Jerubbaal
and
his
household
and
have
you
treated
him
as
he
deserves
17
When
my
father
fought
for
you
he
risked
his
life
to
save
you
from
Midians
hand
18
But
today
you
have
risen
up
against
my
fathers
household
and
killed
his
sons
70
men
on
one
stone
Then
you
made
Abimelech
the
son
of
his
slave
girl
king
over
the
leaders
of
Shechem
just
because
he
is
your
brother
19
Yes
if
you
are
acting
sincerely
and
honorably
toward
Jerubbaal
and
his
household
this
day
rejoice
over
Abimelech
and
let
him
also
rejoice
over
you
20
But
if
not
may
fire
come
out
of
Abimelech
and
consume
the
leaders
of
Shechem
and
Beth-millo
and
may
fire
come
out
of
the
leaders
of
Shechem
and
Beth-millo
and
consume
Abimelech
21
Then
Jotham
fled
and
escaped
to
Beer
and
he
lived
there
because
of
his
brother
Abimelech
22
Abimelech
ruled
over
Israel
for
three
years
23
Then
God
let
hostility
develop
between
Abimelech
and
the
leaders
of
Shechem
and
they
dealt
treacherously
with
Abimelech
24
This
was
so
that
the
violence
done
to
the
70
sons
of
Jerubbaal
might
be
avenged
so
as
to
place
responsibility
for
their
blood
on
their
brother
Abimelech
for
killing
them
and
on
the
leaders
of
Shechem
for
helping
him
to
kill
his
brothers
25
So
the
leaders
of
Shechem
set
men
to
ambush
him
on
the
mountaintops
and
they
would
rob
everyone
who
passed
by
them
on
the
road
In
time
it
was
reported
to
Abimelech
26
Then
Gaal
son
of
Ebed
and
his
brothers
crossed
over
into
Shechem
and
the
leaders
of
Shechem
put
their
trust
in
him
27
They
went
out
into
the
field
and
gathered
the
grapes
of
their
vineyards
trod
them
out
and
held
a
festival
after
which
they
went
into
the
house
of
their
god
and
ate
and
drank
and
cursed
Abimelech
28
Then
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
said
Who
is
Abimelech
and
who
is
Shechem
that
we
should
serve
him
Is
he
not
the
son
of
Jerubbaal
and
is
not
Zebul
his
commissioner
Serve
the
men
of
Hamor
Shechems
father
But
why
should
we
serve
him
29
If
only
this
people
were
under
my
command
I
would
depose
Abimelech
Then
he
said
to
Abimelech
Increase
your
army
and
come
out
30
When
Zebul
the
prince
of
the
city
heard
the
words
of
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
his
anger
blazed
31
So
he
secretly
sent
messengers
to
Abimelech
saying
Look
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
and
his
brothers
are
now
in
Shechem
and
here
they
are
inciting
the
city
against
you
32
Now
come
up
by
night
you
and
your
men
and
lie
in
wait
in
the
field
33
As
soon
as
the
sun
rises
in
the
morning
you
should
get
up
early
and
attack
the
city
and
when
he
and
his
men
come
out
against
you
do
whatever
you
can
to
defeat
him
34
So
Abimelech
and
all
the
people
with
him
rose
up
by
night
and
in
four
bands
they
lay
in
wait
against
Shechem
35
When
Gaal
the
son
of
Ebed
went
out
and
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
gate
Abimelech
and
the
people
with
him
rose
up
from
the
ambush
36
When
Gaal
saw
the
people
he
said
to
Zebul
Look
There
are
people
coming
down
from
the
mountaintops
But
Zebul
said
to
him
You
are
seeing
the
shadows
of
the
mountains
as
if
they
were
men
37
Gaal
later
said
Look
People
are
coming
down
from
the
center
of
the
land
and
one
band
is
coming
by
the
way
of
the
big
tree
of
Meonenim
38
Zebul
replied
to
him
Where
now
is
your
boast
Who
is
Abimelech
that
we
should
serve
him
Are
these
not
the
people
you
rejected
Go
out
now
and
fight
against
them
39
So
Gaal
went
out
at
the
head
of
the
leaders
of
Shechem
and
fought
against
Abimelech
40
Abimelech
pursued
him
and
Gaal
fled
from
him
and
many
fell
slain
as
far
as
the
entrance
of
the
city
gate
41
And
Abimelech
continued
to
dwell
in
Arumah
and
Zebul
drove
Gaal
and
his
brothers
out
of
Shechem
42
The
next
day
the
people
went
out
into
the
field
and
Abimelech
was
told
about
it
43
So
he
took
the
people
and
divided
them
into
three
bands
and
lay
in
wait
in
the
field
When
he
saw
the
people
going
out
of
the
city
he
attacked
them
and
struck
them
down
44
Abimelech
and
the
bands
with
him
charged
forward
and
took
a
position
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
gate
while
two
bands
attacked
all
who
were
in
the
field
and
they
struck
them
down
45
Abimelech
fought
against
the
city
all
that
day
and
captured
it
He
killed
the
people
in
it
and
then
he
pulled
the
city
down
and
sowed
it
with
salt
46
When
all
the
leaders
of
the
tower
of
Shechem
heard
about
this
they
immediately
went
to
the
vault
of
the
house
of
El-berith
47
As
soon
as
it
was
reported
to
Abimelech
that
all
the
leaders
of
the
tower
of
Shechem
had
gathered
together
48
Abimelech
and
all
the
men
with
him
went
up
Mount
Zalmon
Abimelech
took
an
ax
in
his
hand
and
cut
off
a
tree
branch
and
lifted
it
on
his
shoulder
and
said
to
the
people
with
him
What
you
saw
me
do
hurry
and
do
the
same
49
So
all
the
people
also
cut
off
branches
and
followed
Abimelech
Then
they
put
the
branches
against
the
vault
and
set
the
vault
on
fire
So
all
the
people
of
the
tower
of
Shechem
also
died
about
1000
men
and
women
50
Abimelech
then
went
to
Thebez
he
camped
against
Thebez
and
captured
it
51
There
was
a
strong
tower
in
the
middle
of
the
city
and
all
the
men
and
women
and
all
the
city
leaders
fled
there
They
shut
themselves
in
and
climbed
onto
the
roof
of
the
tower
52
Abimelech
made
his
way
to
the
tower
and
attacked
it
He
approached
the
entrance
of
the
tower
to
set
it
on
fire
53
Then
one
of
the
women
dropped
an
upper
millstone
on
Abimelechs
head
and
crushed
his
skull
54
He
quickly
called
the
attendant
bearing
his
weapons
and
said
to
him
Draw
your
sword
and
put
me
to
death
so
that
they
may
not
say
about
me
A
woman
killed
him
So
his
attendant
ran
him
through
and
he
died
55
When
the
men
of
Israel
saw
that
Abimelech
was
dead
they
all
went
back
home
56
Thus
God
repaid
Abimelech
for
the
evil
that
he
had
done
to
his
father
by
killing
his
70
brothers
57
God
also
made
all
the
evil
of
the
men
of
Shechem
come
back
on
their
own
heads
So
the
curse
of
Jotham
the
son
of
Jerubbaal
came
upon
them
1
After
Abimelech
Tola
the
son
of
Puah
the
son
of
Dodo
a
man
of
Issachar
rose
up
to
save
Israel
He
lived
in
Shamir
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
2
He
judged
Israel
for
23
years
Then
he
died
and
was
buried
in
Shamir
3
After
him
Jair
the
Gileadite
rose
up
and
judged
Israel
for
22
years
4
He
had
30
sons
who
rode
on
30
donkeys
and
they
had
30
cities
which
to
this
day
are
called
Havvoth-jair
they
are
in
the
land
of
Gilead
5
After
that
Jair
died
and
was
buried
in
Kamon
6
Again
the
Israelites
did
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
they
began
to
serve
the
Baals
the
Ashtoreth
images
the
gods
of
Aram
the
gods
of
Sidon
the
gods
of
Moab
the
gods
of
the
Ammonites
and
the
gods
of
the
Philistines
They
abandoned
Jehovah
and
did
not
serve
him
7
Then
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
Israel
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hands
of
the
Philistines
and
the
Ammonites
8
So
they
crushed
and
greatly
oppressed
the
Israelites
in
that
year—for
18
years
they
oppressed
all
the
Israelites
on
the
side
of
the
Jordan
that
had
been
the
land
of
the
Amorites
in
Gilead
9
The
Ammonites
would
also
cross
the
Jordan
to
fight
against
Judah
and
Benjamin
and
the
house
of
Ephraim
and
Israel
was
greatly
distressed
10
Then
the
Israelites
called
to
Jehovah
for
help
saying
We
have
sinned
against
you
for
we
abandoned
our
God
and
served
the
Baals
11
But
Jehovah
said
to
the
Israelites
Did
I
not
save
you
from
Egypt
and
from
the
Amorites
the
Ammonites
the
Philistines
12
the
Sidonians
Amalek
and
Midian
when
they
oppressed
you
When
you
cried
out
to
me
I
saved
you
out
of
their
hand
13
But
you
abandoned
me
and
served
other
gods
That
is
why
I
will
not
save
you
again
14
Go
to
the
gods
whom
you
have
chosen
and
call
for
help
Let
them
save
you
in
your
time
of
distress
15
But
the
Israelites
said
to
Jehovah
We
have
sinned
Do
to
us
whatever
is
good
in
your
eyes
Only
save
us
please
this
day
16
And
they
removed
the
foreign
gods
from
their
midst
and
served
Jehovah
so
that
he
could
no
longer
tolerate
Israels
suffering
17
In
time
the
Ammonites
were
called
together
and
they
pitched
camp
in
Gilead
So
the
Israelites
gathered
together
and
pitched
camp
in
Mizpah
18
The
people
and
the
princes
of
Gilead
said
to
one
another
Who
will
take
the
lead
in
fighting
against
the
Ammonites
Let
him
become
the
chief
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
Gilead
1
Now
Jephthah
the
Gileadite
was
a
mighty
warrior
he
was
the
son
of
a
prostitute
and
Gilead
was
Jephthahs
father
2
But
Gileads
wife
also
bore
him
sons
When
the
sons
of
his
wife
grew
up
they
drove
Jephthah
out
and
said
to
him
You
will
have
no
inheritance
in
our
fathers
household
for
you
are
the
son
of
another
woman
3
So
Jephthah
fled
from
his
brothers
and
settled
in
the
land
of
Tob
And
idle
men
joined
company
with
Jephthah
and
they
followed
him
4
After
a
while
the
Ammonites
fought
against
Israel
5
And
when
the
Ammonites
fought
against
Israel
the
elders
of
Gilead
immediately
went
to
bring
Jephthah
back
from
the
land
of
Tob
6
They
said
to
Jephthah
Come
and
serve
as
our
commander
so
that
we
can
fight
against
the
Ammonites
7
But
Jephthah
said
to
the
elders
of
Gilead
Was
it
not
you
who
hated
me
so
much
that
you
drove
me
out
of
my
fathers
house
Why
have
you
come
to
me
now
when
you
are
in
distress
8
At
this
the
elders
of
Gilead
said
to
Jephthah
That
is
why
now
we
have
returned
to
you
If
you
go
with
us
and
fight
against
the
Ammonites
you
will
become
our
leader
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
Gilead
9
So
Jephthah
said
to
the
elders
of
Gilead
If
you
bring
me
back
to
fight
against
the
Ammonites
and
Jehovah
defeats
them
for
me
then
I
will
indeed
become
your
leader
10
The
elders
of
Gilead
said
to
Jephthah
Let
Jehovah
be
the
witness
between
us
if
we
do
not
do
as
you
say
11
So
Jephthah
went
with
the
elders
of
Gilead
and
the
people
made
him
their
leader
and
commander
And
Jephthah
repeated
all
his
words
before
Jehovah
in
Mizpah
12
Jephthah
then
sent
messengers
to
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
saying
What
do
you
have
against
me
that
you
have
come
to
attack
my
land
13
So
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
said
to
the
messengers
of
Jephthah
It
is
because
Israel
took
my
land
when
they
came
up
out
of
Egypt
from
the
Arnon
to
the
Jabbok
and
as
far
as
the
Jordan
Now
return
it
peaceably
14
But
Jephthah
sent
messengers
back
to
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
15
to
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jephthah
says
Israel
did
not
take
the
land
of
the
Moabites
and
the
land
of
the
Ammonites
16
for
when
they
came
up
out
of
Egypt
Israel
walked
through
the
wilderness
as
far
as
the
Red
Sea
and
came
to
Kadesh
17
Then
Israel
sent
messengers
to
the
king
of
Edom
saying
Please
let
us
pass
through
your
land

but
the
king
of
Edom
did
not
listen
Also
to
the
king
of
Moab
they
sent
word
but
he
did
not
consent
So
Israel
kept
dwelling
in
Kadesh
18
When
they
walked
through
the
wilderness
they
bypassed
the
land
of
Edom
and
the
land
of
Moab
They
traveled
east
of
the
land
of
Moab
and
camped
in
the
region
of
the
Arnon
they
did
not
come
within
the
boundary
of
Moab
for
the
Arnon
was
the
boundary
of
Moab
19
After
that
Israel
sent
messengers
to
Sihon
king
of
the
Amorites
king
of
Heshbon
and
Israel
said
to
him
Please
let
us
pass
through
your
land
to
our
own
place
20
But
Sihon
did
not
trust
Israel
to
cross
through
his
territory
so
Sihon
gathered
all
his
people
together
and
encamped
in
Jahaz
and
fought
against
Israel
21
At
this
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
gave
Sihon
and
all
his
people
into
Israels
hand
so
that
they
defeated
them
and
Israel
took
possession
of
all
the
land
of
the
Amorites
the
inhabitants
of
that
land
22
Thus
they
took
possession
of
all
the
territory
of
the
Amorites
from
the
Arnon
to
the
Jabbok
and
from
the
wilderness
to
the
Jordan
23
It
was
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
who
drove
out
the
Amorites
from
before
his
people
Israel
and
now
would
you
drive
them
out
24
Do
you
not
possess
whatever
your
god
Chemosh
gives
you
to
possess
So
everyone
whom
Jehovah
our
God
has
driven
out
from
before
us
is
the
one
we
will
drive
out
25
Now
are
you
any
better
than
Balak
the
son
of
Zippor
the
king
of
Moab
Did
he
ever
contend
with
Israel
or
did
he
ever
fight
against
them
26
While
Israel
was
dwelling
in
Heshbon
and
its
dependent
towns
and
in
Aroer
and
its
dependent
towns
and
in
all
the
cities
that
are
by
the
banks
of
the
Arnon
for
300
years
why
did
you
never
try
to
take
them
back
during
that
time
27
I
have
not
sinned
against
you
but
you
are
wrong
to
attack
me
Let
Jehovah
the
Judge
be
judge
today
between
the
people
of
Israel
and
the
people
of
Ammon
28
But
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
would
not
listen
to
the
message
that
Jephthah
sent
to
him
29
Jehovahs
spirit
came
upon
Jephthah
and
he
passed
through
Gilead
and
Manasseh
to
go
to
Mizpeh
of
Gilead
and
from
Mizpeh
of
Gilead
he
continued
on
to
the
Ammonites
30
Then
Jephthah
made
a
vow
to
Jehovah
and
said
If
you
give
the
Ammonites
into
my
hand
31
then
whoever
comes
out
of
the
door
of
my
house
to
meet
me
when
I
return
in
peace
from
the
Ammonites
will
become
Jehovahs
and
I
will
offer
that
one
up
as
a
burnt
offering
32
So
Jephthah
went
to
fight
against
the
Ammonites
and
Jehovah
gave
them
into
his
hand
33
He
struck
them
down
with
a
very
great
slaughter
from
Aroer
all
the
way
to
Minnith—20
cities—and
as
far
as
Abel-keramim
Thus
the
Ammonites
were
subdued
before
the
Israelites
34
Finally
Jephthah
came
to
his
home
in
Mizpah
and
look
his
daughter
was
coming
out
to
meet
him
playing
the
tambourine
and
dancing
Now
she
was
his
one
and
only
child
Besides
her
he
had
neither
son
nor
daughter
35
When
he
saw
her
he
ripped
his
garments
and
said
Oh
no
my
daughter
You
have
broken
my
heart
for
you
have
become
the
one
I
have
banished
Now
I
have
opened
my
mouth
to
Jehovah
and
I
am
unable
to
turn
back
36
But
she
said
to
him
My
father
if
you
have
opened
your
mouth
to
Jehovah
do
to
me
as
you
have
promised
since
Jehovah
has
executed
vengeance
for
you
upon
your
enemies
the
Ammonites
37
She
then
said
to
her
father
Let
this
be
done
for
me
Let
me
be
alone
for
two
months
and
let
me
go
away
into
the
mountains
and
let
me
weep
over
my
virginity
with
my
female
companions
38
At
this
he
said
Go
So
he
sent
her
away
for
two
months
and
she
went
to
the
mountains
with
her
companions
to
weep
over
her
virginity
39
At
the
end
of
two
months
she
returned
to
her
father
after
which
he
carried
out
the
vow
he
had
made
regarding
her
She
never
had
relations
with
a
man
And
it
became
a
custom
in
Israel
40
From
year
to
year
the
young
women
of
Israel
would
go
to
give
commendation
to
the
daughter
of
Jephthah
the
Gileadite
four
days
in
the
year
1
Then
the
men
of
Ephraim
were
summoned
and
they
crossed
over
to
Zaphon
and
said
to
Jephthah
Why
did
you
not
call
us
to
go
with
you
when
you
crossed
over
to
fight
against
the
Ammonites
We
will
burn
your
house
down
with
you
in
it
2
But
Jephthah
said
to
them
Along
with
my
people
I
was
engaged
in
a
great
conflict
with
the
Ammonites
I
did
call
to
you
for
help
but
you
did
not
save
me
from
their
hand
3
When
I
saw
that
you
would
not
save
me
then
I
decided
to
risk
my
life
and
go
against
the
Ammonites
and
Jehovah
handed
them
over
to
me
So
why
have
you
come
today
to
fight
against
me
4
Jephthah
then
gathered
all
the
men
of
Gilead
and
they
fought
Ephraim
the
men
of
Gilead
defeated
Ephraim
who
had
said
You
are
only
fugitives
from
Ephraim
you
Gileadites
in
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
5
Gilead
captured
the
fords
of
the
Jordan
ahead
of
Ephraim
and
when
the
men
of
Ephraim
were
trying
to
escape
they
would
say
Let
me
cross
over
then
the
men
of
Gilead
would
ask
each
one
Are
you
an
Ephraimite
When
he
would
reply
No
6
they
would
say
to
him
Please
say
Shibboleth
But
he
would
say
Sibboleth

as
he
was
unable
to
say
the
word
correctly
Then
they
would
seize
him
and
slay
him
at
the
fords
of
the
Jordan
So
42000
Ephraimites
fell
at
that
time
7
Jephthah
judged
Israel
for
six
years
after
which
Jephthah
the
Gileadite
died
and
was
buried
in
his
city
in
Gilead
8
Ibzan
from
Bethlehem
judged
Israel
after
him
9
He
had
30
sons
and
30
daughters
He
sent
his
daughters
to
marry
men
outside
his
clan
and
he
brought
in
30
women
to
marry
his
sons
He
judged
Israel
for
seven
years
10
Then
Ibzan
died
and
was
buried
in
Bethlehem
11
After
him
Elon
the
Zebulunite
judged
Israel
he
judged
Israel
for
ten
years
12
Then
Elon
the
Zebulunite
died
and
was
buried
in
Aijalon
in
the
land
of
Zebulun
13
After
him
Abdon
the
son
of
Hillel
the
Pirathonite
judged
Israel
14
He
had
40
sons
and
30
grandsons
who
rode
on
70
donkeys
He
judged
Israel
for
eight
years
15
Then
Abdon
the
son
of
Hillel
the
Pirathonite
died
and
was
buried
in
Pirathon
in
the
land
of
Ephraim
in
the
mountain
of
the
Amalekite
1
Again
the
Israelites
did
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
and
Jehovah
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
for
40
years
2
Meanwhile
there
was
a
man
of
Zorah
of
the
family
of
the
Danites
whose
name
was
Manoah
His
wife
was
barren
and
childless
3
In
time
Jehovahs
angel
appeared
to
the
woman
and
said
to
her
Look
you
are
barren
and
childless
But
you
will
conceive
and
give
birth
to
a
son
4
Now
be
careful
not
to
drink
wine
or
anything
alcoholic
and
do
not
eat
anything
unclean
5
Look
You
will
conceive
and
give
birth
to
a
son
and
no
razor
should
touch
his
head
because
the
child
will
be
a
Nazirite
of
God
from
birth
and
he
will
take
the
lead
in
saving
Israel
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
6
Then
the
woman
went
and
told
her
husband
A
man
of
the
true
God
came
to
me
and
his
appearance
was
like
an
angel
of
the
true
God
very
awe-inspiring
I
did
not
ask
him
where
he
was
from
nor
did
he
tell
me
his
name
7
But
he
said
to
me
Look
You
will
conceive
and
give
birth
to
a
son
Now
do
not
drink
wine
or
anything
alcoholic
and
do
not
eat
anything
unclean
because
the
child
will
be
a
Nazirite
of
God
from
birth
until
the
day
of
his
death
8
Manoah
pleaded
with
Jehovah
and
said
Pardon
me
Jehovah
Please
let
the
man
of
the
true
God
whom
you
just
sent
come
again
to
instruct
us
about
what
we
should
do
with
the
child
who
will
be
born
9
So
the
true
God
listened
to
Manoah
and
the
angel
of
the
true
God
came
again
to
the
woman
while
she
was
sitting
in
the
field
her
husband
Manoah
was
not
with
her
10
The
woman
quickly
ran
and
told
her
husband
Look
The
man
who
came
to
me
the
other
day
has
appeared
to
me
11
Then
Manoah
got
up
and
went
with
his
wife
He
came
to
the
man
and
said
to
him
Are
you
the
man
who
spoke
to
my
wife
He
said
I
am
12
Then
Manoah
said
May
your
words
come
true
What
will
be
the
childs
manner
of
life
and
what
will
be
his
work
13
So
Jehovahs
angel
said
to
Manoah
Your
wife
should
keep
herself
from
everything
that
I
mentioned
to
her
14
She
should
not
eat
anything
that
the
grapevine
produces
she
should
not
drink
wine
or
anything
alcoholic
and
she
should
not
eat
anything
unclean
Everything
that
I
commanded
her
let
her
observe
15
Manoah
now
said
to
Jehovahs
angel
Please
stay
and
let
us
prepare
a
young
goat
for
you
16
But
Jehovahs
angel
said
to
Manoah
If
I
stay
I
will
not
eat
your
food
but
if
you
wish
to
present
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
you
may
offer
it
up
Manoah
did
not
know
that
he
was
Jehovahs
angel
17
Then
Manoah
said
to
Jehovahs
angel
What
is
your
name
so
that
we
may
honor
you
when
your
word
comes
true
18
However
Jehovahs
angel
said
to
him
Why
are
you
asking
about
my
name
seeing
that
it
is
a
wonderful
one
19
Then
Manoah
took
the
young
goat
and
the
grain
offering
and
offered
them
on
the
rock
to
Jehovah
And
He
was
doing
something
amazing
while
Manoah
and
his
wife
were
looking
on
20
As
the
flame
ascended
from
the
altar
heavenward
Jehovahs
angel
ascended
in
the
flame
from
the
altar
while
Manoah
and
his
wife
were
looking
on
At
once
they
fell
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
21
Jehovahs
angel
did
not
appear
again
to
Manoah
and
his
wife
Then
Manoah
realized
that
he
was
Jehovahs
angel
22
Manoah
then
said
to
his
wife
We
are
sure
to
die
because
it
is
God
whom
we
have
seen
23
But
his
wife
said
to
him
If
Jehovah
wanted
to
put
us
to
death
he
would
not
have
accepted
a
burnt
offering
and
a
grain
offering
from
our
hand
he
would
not
have
shown
us
all
these
things
and
he
would
not
have
told
us
any
of
these
things
24
The
woman
later
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
named
him
Samson
and
as
the
boy
grew
Jehovah
continued
to
bless
him
25
In
time
Jehovahs
spirit
started
to
impel
him
in
Mahaneh-dan
between
Zorah
and
Eshtaol
1
Then
Samson
went
down
to
Timnah
and
in
Timnah
he
saw
a
Philistine
woman
2
So
he
went
up
and
told
his
father
and
mother
In
Timnah
a
Philistine
woman
caught
my
eye
and
I
want
you
to
get
her
for
me
as
a
wife
3
But
his
father
and
mother
said
to
him
Can
you
not
find
a
woman
among
your
relatives
and
among
all
our
people
Must
you
go
and
take
a
wife
from
among
the
uncircumcised
Philistines
But
Samson
said
to
his
father
Get
her
for
me
because
she
is
the
right
one
for
me
4
His
father
and
mother
did
not
realize
that
this
was
from
Jehovah
for
He
was
looking
for
an
opportunity
against
the
Philistines
as
the
Philistines
were
ruling
over
Israel
at
that
time
5
So
Samson
went
down
with
his
father
and
mother
to
Timnah
When
he
reached
the
vineyards
of
Timnah
why
look
a
lion
came
roaring
at
him
6
Then
Jehovahs
spirit
empowered
him
and
he
tore
it
in
two
just
as
someone
tears
a
young
goat
in
two
with
his
bare
hands
But
he
did
not
tell
his
father
or
mother
what
he
had
done
7
Then
he
went
down
and
spoke
to
the
woman
and
she
was
still
the
right
one
in
Samsons
eyes
8
Later
when
he
was
going
back
to
take
her
home
he
turned
aside
to
look
at
the
dead
body
of
the
lion
and
there
in
the
lions
carcass
was
a
swarm
of
bees
and
honey
9
So
he
scraped
the
honey
out
into
his
hands
and
ate
it
as
he
walked
along
When
he
rejoined
his
father
and
mother
he
gave
them
some
to
eat
But
he
did
not
tell
them
that
he
had
scraped
the
honey
out
of
the
carcass
of
a
lion
10
His
father
went
down
to
the
woman
and
Samson
held
a
banquet
there
for
that
was
what
the
young
men
used
to
do
11
When
they
saw
him
they
brought
30
groomsmen
to
accompany
him
12
Then
Samson
said
to
them
Please
let
me
tell
you
a
riddle
If
during
the
seven
days
of
the
banquet
you
solve
it
and
tell
me
the
answer
I
will
have
to
give
you
30
linen
garments
and
30
outfits
of
clothing
13
But
if
you
are
unable
to
tell
me
the
answer
you
must
give
me
30
linen
garments
and
30
outfits
of
clothing
They
said
Tell
us
your
riddle
we
want
to
hear
it
14
So
he
said
to
them
Out
of
the
eater
came
something
to
eat
And
out
of
the
strong
came
something
sweet
They
were
unable
to
solve
the
riddle
for
three
days
15
On
the
fourth
day
they
said
to
Samsons
wife
Trick
your
husband
so
that
he
will
tell
us
the
answer
to
the
riddle
Otherwise
we
will
burn
you
and
your
fathers
house
with
fire
Did
you
invite
us
here
to
take
our
possessions
16
So
Samsons
wife
wept
over
him
and
said
You
must
hate
me
you
do
not
love
me
You
told
a
riddle
to
my
people
but
you
have
not
told
the
answer
to
me
At
this
he
said
to
her
Why
I
have
not
told
it
even
to
my
own
father
and
mother
Should
I
tell
it
to
you
17
But
she
kept
weeping
over
him
the
rest
of
the
seven-day
banquet
He
finally
told
her
on
the
seventh
day
because
she
had
pressured
him
Then
she
told
her
people
the
answer
to
the
riddle
18
So
on
the
seventh
day
before
the
sun
set
the
men
of
the
city
said
to
him
What
is
sweeter
than
honey
And
what
is
stronger
than
a
lion
He
replied
to
them
If
you
had
not
plowed
with
my
young
cow
You
would
not
have
solved
my
riddle
19
Then
Jehovahs
spirit
empowered
him
and
he
went
down
to
Ashkelon
and
struck
down
30
of
their
men
and
took
their
clothing
and
gave
the
outfits
to
those
who
had
answered
the
riddle
He
was
furious
as
he
went
back
up
to
his
fathers
house
20
Samsons
wife
was
then
given
to
one
of
his
groomsmen
who
had
accompanied
him
1
After
a
while
in
the
days
of
the
wheat
harvest
Samson
went
to
visit
his
wife
bringing
a
young
goat
He
said
I
wish
to
go
in
to
my
wife
in
the
bedroom
But
her
father
did
not
allow
him
to
go
in
2
Her
father
said
I
thought
You
must
surely
hate
her
So
I
gave
her
to
your
groomsman
Is
not
her
younger
sister
more
attractive
than
she
is
Please
take
her
instead
3
However
Samson
said
to
them
This
time
I
cannot
be
blamed
by
the
Philistines
for
harming
them
4
So
Samson
went
and
caught
300
foxes
Then
he
took
torches
turned
the
foxes
tail
to
tail
and
put
one
torch
between
each
pair
of
tails
5
Then
he
set
fire
to
the
torches
and
sent
the
foxes
out
into
the
fields
of
standing
grain
of
the
Philistines
He
set
on
fire
everything
from
sheaf
to
standing
grain
as
well
as
the
vineyards
and
the
olive
groves
6
The
Philistines
asked
Who
did
this
They
were
told
It
was
Samson
the
son-in-law
of
the
Timnite
because
he
took
his
wife
and
gave
her
to
his
groomsman
At
that
the
Philistines
went
up
and
burned
her
and
her
father
with
fire
7
Then
Samson
said
to
them
If
this
is
how
you
act
I
will
not
quit
until
I
take
revenge
on
you
8
Then
he
struck
them
down
one
after
the
other
with
a
great
slaughter
after
which
he
went
down
and
stayed
in
a
cave
of
the
crag
Etam
9
Later
the
Philistines
came
up
and
camped
in
Judah
and
were
tramping
about
in
Lehi
10
Then
the
men
of
Judah
said
Why
have
you
come
up
against
us
to
which
they
answered
We
have
come
up
to
capture
Samson
to
do
to
him
just
as
he
did
to
us
11
So
3000
men
of
Judah
went
down
to
the
cave
of
the
crag
Etam
and
said
to
Samson
Do
you
not
know
that
the
Philistines
are
ruling
over
us
So
why
have
you
done
this
to
us
He
said
to
them
As
they
did
to
me
so
I
did
to
them
12
But
they
said
to
him
We
have
come
to
capture
you
and
to
hand
you
over
to
the
Philistines
Then
Samson
said
Swear
to
me
that
you
yourselves
will
not
assault
me
13
They
said
to
him
No
we
will
only
tie
you
and
hand
you
over
to
them
but
we
will
not
put
you
to
death
So
they
bound
him
with
two
new
ropes
and
brought
him
up
from
the
crag
14
When
he
came
to
Lehi
the
Philistines
shouted
triumphantly
at
meeting
him
Then
Jehovahs
spirit
empowered
him
and
the
ropes
on
his
arms
became
like
linen
threads
that
were
scorched
with
fire
and
his
fetters
melted
off
his
hands
15
He
now
found
a
fresh
jawbone
of
a
male
donkey
he
reached
out
and
grabbed
it
and
struck
down
1000
men
with
it
16
Then
Samson
said
With
the
jawbone
of
a
donkey—one
heap
two
heaps
With
the
jawbone
of
a
donkey
I
struck
down
1000
men
17
When
he
finished
speaking
he
threw
the
jawbone
away
and
called
that
place
Ramath-lehi
18
Then
he
became
very
thirsty
and
he
called
on
Jehovah
and
said
It
was
you
who
gave
this
great
salvation
into
the
hand
of
your
servant
But
now
am
I
to
die
of
thirst
and
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
uncircumcised
19
So
God
split
open
a
hollow
that
was
in
Lehi
and
water
flowed
from
it
When
he
drank
his
spirit
returned
and
he
revived
That
is
why
he
named
the
place
En-hakkore
which
is
in
Lehi
to
this
day
20
And
he
judged
Israel
in
the
days
of
the
Philistines
for
20
years
1
One
time
Samson
went
to
Gaza
and
saw
a
prostitute
there
and
he
went
in
to
her
2
The
Gazites
were
told
Samson
has
come
here
So
they
surrounded
him
and
lay
in
ambush
for
him
all
night
long
in
the
city
gate
They
stayed
quiet
the
whole
night
saying
to
themselves
When
daylight
comes
we
will
kill
him
3
However
Samson
kept
lying
there
until
midnight
Then
he
got
up
at
midnight
and
grabbed
the
doors
of
the
city
gate
and
the
two
side
posts
and
pulled
them
out
along
with
the
bar
He
put
them
on
his
shoulders
and
carried
them
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
that
faces
Hebron
4
After
that
he
fell
in
love
with
a
woman
in
the
Valley
of
Sorek
whose
name
was
Delilah
5
So
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
approached
her
and
said
Trick
him
and
find
out
what
gives
him
such
great
strength
and
how
we
can
overpower
him
and
tie
him
and
subdue
him
For
this
we
will
each
give
you
1100
silver
pieces
6
Delilah
later
said
to
Samson
Please
tell
me
where
your
great
power
comes
from
and
what
can
be
used
to
tie
you
and
subdue
you
7
Samson
said
to
her
If
they
tie
me
with
seven
fresh
bowstrings
that
have
not
been
dried
out
I
will
grow
as
weak
as
an
ordinary
man
8
So
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
brought
up
to
her
seven
fresh
bowstrings
that
had
not
been
dried
out
and
she
tied
him
with
them
9
Now
they
set
an
ambush
in
the
inner
room
and
she
called
out
to
him
The
Philistines
are
upon
you
Samson
At
that
he
tore
apart
the
bowstrings
just
as
easily
as
a
thread
of
flax
comes
apart
when
it
touches
fire
The
secret
of
his
power
did
not
become
known
10
Then
Delilah
said
to
Samson
Look
You
have
fooled
me
and
told
me
lies
Now
tell
me
please
what
can
be
used
to
tie
you
11
So
he
said
to
her
If
they
tie
me
up
with
new
ropes
that
have
not
been
used
for
work
I
will
grow
as
weak
as
an
ordinary
man
12
So
Delilah
took
new
ropes
and
tied
him
with
them
and
called
out
The
Philistines
are
upon
you
Samson
All
the
while
the
ambush
was
set
in
the
inner
room
At
that
he
tore
them
off
his
arms
like
threads
13
After
that
Delilah
said
to
Samson
Up
until
now
you
have
fooled
me
and
told
me
lies
Tell
me
what
can
be
used
to
tie
you
Then
he
said
to
her
If
you
weave
the
seven
braids
of
my
head
with
the
warp
thread
14
So
she
fixed
them
with
a
pin
and
called
out
to
him
The
Philistines
are
upon
you
Samson
So
he
woke
up
from
his
sleep
and
pulled
out
the
loom
pin
and
the
warp
thread
15
She
now
said
to
him
How
can
you
say
I
love
you

when
your
heart
is
not
with
me
These
three
times
you
have
fooled
me
and
have
not
told
me
the
source
of
your
great
power
16
Because
day
after
day
she
kept
nagging
him
and
pressuring
him
he
was
weary
to
the
point
of
dying
17
So
he
finally
opened
his
heart
to
her
saying
A
razor
has
never
touched
my
head
because
I
am
a
Nazirite
of
God
from
birth
If
I
am
shaved
my
power
will
leave
me
and
I
will
grow
weak
and
become
like
all
other
men
18
When
Delilah
saw
that
he
had
opened
his
heart
to
her
she
immediately
summoned
the
Philistine
lords
saying
Come
up
this
time
for
he
has
opened
his
heart
to
me
So
the
Philistine
lords
came
up
to
her
bringing
the
money
with
them
19
She
made
him
fall
asleep
on
her
knees
then
she
called
the
man
and
had
him
shave
off
the
seven
braids
of
his
head
After
that
she
began
to
have
control
over
him
for
his
power
was
leaving
him
20
Now
she
called
out
The
Philistines
are
upon
you
Samson
He
woke
up
from
his
sleep
and
said
I
will
go
out
as
at
other
times
and
shake
myself
free
But
he
did
not
know
that
Jehovah
had
left
him
21
So
the
Philistines
seized
him
and
bored
his
eyes
out
Then
they
brought
him
down
to
Gaza
and
bound
him
with
two
copper
fetters
and
he
became
a
grinder
of
grain
in
the
prison
22
But
the
hair
of
his
head
started
to
grow
back
again
after
he
had
been
shaved
23
The
Philistine
lords
gathered
together
to
offer
a
great
sacrifice
to
Dagon
their
god
and
to
celebrate
for
they
were
saying
Our
god
has
given
Samson
our
enemy
into
our
hand
24
When
the
people
saw
him
they
praised
their
god
and
said
Our
god
has
given
into
our
hand
our
enemy
the
one
who
devastated
our
land
and
killed
so
many
of
us
25
Because
their
heart
was
cheerful
they
said
Call
Samson
to
provide
us
some
amusement
So
they
called
Samson
out
of
the
prison
to
entertain
them
they
made
him
stand
between
the
pillars
26
Then
Samson
said
to
the
boy
holding
him
by
the
hand
Let
me
feel
the
pillars
that
support
the
house
so
that
I
can
lean
against
them
27
Incidentally
the
house
was
full
of
men
and
women
All
the
Philistine
lords
were
there
and
on
the
roof
there
were
about
3000
men
and
women
who
were
looking
on
while
Samson
provided
amusement
28
Samson
now
called
out
to
Jehovah
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
remember
me
please
and
strengthen
me
please
just
this
once
O
God
and
let
me
take
revenge
on
the
Philistines
for
one
of
my
two
eyes
29
Then
Samson
braced
himself
against
the
two
middle
pillars
that
supported
the
house
and
he
leaned
on
them
with
his
right
hand
on
one
and
his
left
hand
on
the
other
30
Samson
called
out
Let
me
die
with
the
Philistines
Then
he
pushed
with
all
his
might
and
the
house
fell
on
the
lords
and
all
the
people
in
it
So
he
killed
more
at
his
death
than
he
had
killed
during
his
life
31
Later
his
brothers
and
all
his
fathers
family
came
down
to
take
him
back
They
brought
him
up
and
buried
him
between
Zorah
and
Eshtaol
in
the
tomb
of
Manoah
his
father
He
had
judged
Israel
for
20
years
1
There
was
a
man
of
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
named
Micah
2
He
said
to
his
mother
The
1100
silver
pieces
that
were
taken
from
you
about
which
you
pronounced
a
curse
which
I
heard—look
the
silver
is
with
me
I
was
the
one
who
took
it
At
that
his
mother
said
May
Jehovah
bless
my
son
3
So
he
gave
the
1100
pieces
of
silver
back
to
his
mother
but
his
mother
said
I
will
without
fail
sanctify
the
silver
to
Jehovah
from
my
hand
for
my
son
to
use
in
making
a
carved
image
and
a
metal
statue
Now
I
give
it
back
to
you
4
After
he
returned
the
silver
to
his
mother
his
mother
took
200
silver
pieces
and
gave
them
to
the
silversmith
He
made
a
carved
image
and
a
metal
statue
and
they
were
put
in
Micahs
house
5
This
man
Micah
had
a
house
of
gods
and
he
made
an
ephod
and
teraphim
statues
and
installed
one
of
his
sons
to
serve
as
priest
for
him
6
In
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
Israel
Each
one
was
doing
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
7
Now
there
was
a
young
man
of
Bethlehem
in
Judah
who
was
of
the
family
of
Judah
He
was
a
Levite
who
had
been
living
there
for
a
time
8
The
man
left
the
city
of
Bethlehem
in
Judah
to
find
a
place
to
live
While
on
his
journey
he
came
to
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
to
the
house
of
Micah
9
Then
Micah
said
to
him
Where
do
you
come
from
He
replied
I
am
a
Levite
from
Bethlehem
in
Judah
and
I
am
on
my
way
to
find
a
place
to
live
10
So
Micah
said
to
him
Stay
with
me
and
serve
as
a
father
and
a
priest
for
me
I
will
give
you
ten
silver
pieces
a
year
and
a
set
of
garments
and
your
food
So
the
Levite
went
in
11
Thus
the
Levite
agreed
to
stay
with
the
man
and
the
young
man
became
like
one
of
his
sons
12
Furthermore
Micah
installed
the
Levite
to
serve
as
a
priest
for
him
and
he
lived
in
the
house
of
Micah
13
Then
Micah
said
Now
I
know
that
Jehovah
will
be
good
to
me
for
the
Levite
has
become
my
priest
1
In
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
Israel
And
in
those
days
the
tribe
of
the
Danites
was
looking
for
an
inheritance
to
dwell
in
because
until
then
they
had
not
received
an
inheritance
among
the
tribes
of
Israel
2
The
Danites
sent
five
men
from
among
their
family
capable
men
from
Zorah
and
Eshtaol
to
spy
out
the
land
and
to
explore
it
They
said
to
them
Go
explore
the
land
When
they
came
to
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
to
the
house
of
Micah
they
spent
the
night
there
3
While
they
were
near
the
house
of
Micah
they
recognized
the
voice
of
the
young
Levite
man
so
they
went
over
to
him
and
asked
Who
brought
you
here
What
are
you
doing
in
this
place
What
is
keeping
you
here
4
He
replied
to
them
Thus
and
so
Micah
did
for
me
and
he
hired
me
to
serve
as
priest
for
him
5
Then
they
said
to
him
Please
ask
God
whether
our
journey
will
be
successful
6
The
priest
said
to
them
Go
in
peace
Jehovah
is
with
you
on
your
journey
7
So
the
five
men
went
on
and
came
to
Laish
They
saw
how
the
people
in
it
were
dwelling
in
self-reliance
in
the
manner
of
the
Sidonians
They
were
quiet
and
unsuspecting
and
no
oppressive
conqueror
was
in
the
land
to
disturb
them
They
were
far
away
from
the
Sidonians
and
they
had
no
dealings
with
anyone
else
8
When
they
returned
to
their
brothers
at
Zorah
and
Eshtaol
their
brothers
said
to
them
How
did
it
go
9
They
replied
Let
us
go
up
against
them
for
we
have
seen
that
the
land
is
very
good
Why
are
you
hesitant
Do
not
delay
to
go
in
to
take
possession
of
the
land
10
When
you
arrive
you
will
find
an
unsuspecting
people
and
the
land
is
spacious
God
has
given
it
into
your
hand
a
place
where
there
is
no
lack
of
anything
on
the
earth
11
Then
600
men
armed
for
battle
from
the
family
of
the
Danites
departed
from
Zorah
and
Eshtaol
12
They
went
up
and
camped
at
Kiriath-jearim
in
Judah
That
is
why
that
place
which
is
west
of
Kiriath-jearim
is
called
Mahaneh-dan
to
this
day
13
They
went
from
there
to
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
and
came
to
the
house
of
Micah
14
Then
the
five
men
who
had
gone
to
spy
out
the
land
of
Laish
said
to
their
brothers
Did
you
know
that
there
are
in
these
houses
an
ephod
teraphim
statues
a
carved
image
and
a
metal
statue
Think
about
what
you
should
do
15
So
they
stopped
there
and
came
to
the
house
of
the
young
Levite
man
at
the
house
of
Micah
and
asked
how
he
was
16
All
the
while
the
600
men
of
Dan
armed
for
battle
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
gate
17
The
five
men
who
had
gone
to
spy
out
the
land
went
inside
to
take
the
carved
image
the
ephod
the
teraphim
statues
and
the
metal
image
The
priest
was
standing
at
the
entrance
of
the
gate
with
the
600
men
armed
for
battle
18
They
went
into
the
house
of
Micah
and
took
the
carved
image
the
ephod
the
teraphim
statues
and
the
metal
image
The
priest
said
to
them
What
are
you
doing
19
But
they
said
to
him
Be
quiet
Put
your
hand
over
your
mouth
and
come
with
us
to
be
a
father
and
a
priest
for
us
Which
is
better—for
you
to
be
a
priest
to
the
house
of
one
man
or
to
become
a
priest
to
a
tribe
and
family
in
Israel
20
So
the
priest
was
satisfied
and
he
took
the
ephod
the
teraphim
statues
and
the
carved
image
and
went
off
with
the
people
21
Then
they
turned
to
go
on
their
way
putting
the
children
the
livestock
and
the
valuable
things
ahead
of
them
22
They
had
gone
some
distance
away
from
the
house
of
Micah
when
the
men
who
lived
in
the
houses
near
the
house
of
Micah
gathered
together
and
caught
up
with
the
Danites
23
When
they
cried
out
to
the
Danites
they
turned
to
face
them
and
said
to
Micah
What
is
the
matter
Why
have
you
been
gathered
together
24
So
he
said
You
have
taken
my
gods
that
I
made
and
you
have
gone
off
with
the
priest
too
What
do
I
have
left
How
then
can
you
ask
me
What
is
the
matter
with
you
25
The
Danites
replied
Do
not
raise
your
voice
against
us
otherwise
angry
men
may
assault
you
and
that
would
cost
you
your
life
and
the
lives
of
your
household
26
So
the
Danites
went
on
their
way
and
Micah
seeing
that
they
were
stronger
than
he
was
turned
and
went
back
to
his
house
27
After
they
took
what
Micah
had
made
as
well
as
his
priest
they
went
to
Laish
to
a
people
quiet
and
unsuspecting
They
struck
them
down
with
the
sword
and
burned
the
city
with
fire
28
There
was
no
one
to
rescue
it
for
it
was
far
from
Sidon
and
they
had
no
dealings
with
anyone
else
and
it
was
in
the
valley
plain
that
belonged
to
Beth-rehob
Then
they
rebuilt
the
city
and
settled
in
it
29
Furthermore
they
named
the
city
Dan
after
the
name
of
their
father
Dan
who
was
born
to
Israel
But
Laish
was
the
citys
former
name
30
After
that
the
Danites
set
up
the
carved
image
for
themselves
and
Jonathan
the
son
of
Gershom
the
son
of
Moses
and
his
sons
became
priests
to
the
tribe
of
the
Danites
until
the
day
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
went
into
exile
31
And
they
set
up
the
carved
image
that
Micah
had
made
and
it
remained
there
all
the
days
that
the
house
of
the
true
God
was
in
Shiloh
1
In
those
days
when
there
was
no
king
in
Israel
a
Levite
who
was
then
living
in
a
remote
part
of
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
took
a
concubine
from
Bethlehem
in
Judah
as
his
wife
2
But
his
concubine
was
unfaithful
to
him
and
she
left
him
to
go
to
her
fathers
house
at
Bethlehem
in
Judah
She
remained
there
for
four
months
3
Then
her
husband
went
after
her
to
persuade
her
to
come
back
he
had
his
male
attendant
and
a
couple
of
donkeys
with
him
So
she
brought
him
into
her
fathers
house
When
her
father
saw
him
he
was
glad
to
meet
him
4
So
his
father-in-law
the
young
womans
father
convinced
him
to
stay
with
him
three
days
and
they
would
eat
and
drink
and
he
would
spend
the
night
there
5
On
the
fourth
day
when
they
got
up
early
in
the
morning
to
go
the
father
of
the
young
woman
said
to
his
son-in-law
Eat
something
to
give
you
strength
and
then
you
may
go
6
So
they
sat
down
and
they
both
ate
and
drank
together
after
that
the
father
of
the
young
woman
said
to
the
man
Please
stay
overnight
and
enjoy
yourself
7
When
the
man
rose
to
go
his
father-in-law
kept
begging
him
so
he
stayed
overnight
again
8
When
he
got
up
early
in
the
morning
on
the
fifth
day
to
go
the
father
of
the
young
woman
said
Please
eat
something
to
give
you
strength
And
they
lingered
until
it
was
late
in
the
day
and
they
both
kept
eating
9
When
the
man
rose
to
go
with
his
concubine
and
his
attendant
his
father-in-law
the
young
womans
father
said
to
him
Look
now
It
is
almost
evening
Please
stay
overnight
Here
the
day
is
coming
to
an
end
Stay
here
overnight
and
enjoy
yourself
Tomorrow
you
can
get
up
early
for
your
journey
and
go
to
your
home
10
However
the
man
did
not
want
to
stay
another
night
so
he
got
up
and
traveled
as
far
as
Jebus
that
is
Jerusalem
He
had
with
him
the
two
saddled
donkeys
his
concubine
and
his
attendant
11
When
they
were
close
to
Jebus
the
daylight
was
nearly
gone
So
the
attendant
said
to
his
master
Should
we
stop
at
this
city
of
the
Jebusites
and
stay
overnight
here
12
But
his
master
said
to
him
We
should
not
stop
at
a
city
of
foreigners
who
are
not
Israelites
We
will
go
on
as
far
as
Gibeah
13
Then
he
said
to
his
attendant
Come
and
let
us
try
to
reach
one
of
those
places
we
will
stay
overnight
either
in
Gibeah
or
in
Ramah
14
So
they
went
on
their
way
and
the
sun
began
to
set
when
they
were
near
Gibeah
which
belongs
to
Benjamin
15
So
they
stopped
there
and
went
in
to
stay
overnight
in
Gibeah
Once
inside
they
sat
down
in
the
public
square
of
the
city
but
nobody
took
them
into
his
house
to
stay
overnight
16
Eventually
that
evening
an
old
man
came
in
from
his
work
in
the
field
He
was
from
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
and
he
was
living
for
a
time
in
Gibeah
but
the
residents
of
the
city
were
Benjaminites
17
When
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
traveler
in
the
public
square
of
the
city
the
old
man
said
Where
are
you
going
and
where
do
you
come
from
18
He
replied
We
are
traveling
from
Bethlehem
in
Judah
to
a
remote
area
of
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
where
I
am
from
I
went
to
Bethlehem
in
Judah
and
I
am
going
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
but
nobody
is
taking
me
into
his
house
19
We
have
enough
straw
and
fodder
for
our
donkeys
and
bread
and
wine
for
me
the
woman
and
our
attendant
There
is
nothing
lacking
20
However
the
old
man
said
May
you
have
peace
Let
me
take
care
of
anything
you
need
Just
do
not
stay
overnight
in
the
public
square
21
So
he
brought
him
into
his
house
and
gave
feed
to
the
donkeys
Then
they
washed
their
feet
and
ate
and
drank
22
While
they
were
enjoying
themselves
some
worthless
men
of
the
city
surrounded
the
house
and
were
pounding
on
the
door
and
they
kept
saying
to
the
old
man
who
owned
the
house
Bring
out
the
man
who
came
into
your
house
so
that
we
may
have
sex
with
him
23
At
that
the
owner
of
the
house
went
out
and
said
to
them
No
my
brothers
do
not
act
wickedly
Please
this
man
is
a
guest
in
my
house
Do
not
commit
this
disgraceful
act
24
Here
are
my
virgin
daughter
and
this
mans
concubine
Let
me
bring
them
out
and
you
can
humiliate
them
if
you
must
But
you
must
not
commit
this
disgraceful
act
toward
this
man
25
But
the
men
refused
to
listen
to
him
so
the
man
grabbed
hold
of
his
concubine
and
brought
her
outside
to
them
They
raped
her
and
abused
her
all
night
long
until
the
morning
Then
they
sent
her
away
at
the
break
of
dawn
26
Early
in
the
morning
the
woman
came
and
fell
down
at
the
entrance
of
the
mans
house
where
her
master
was
and
lay
there
until
it
was
light
27
When
her
master
got
up
in
the
morning
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
to
go
out
to
resume
his
journey
he
saw
the
woman
his
concubine
lying
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
with
her
hands
on
the
threshold
28
So
he
said
to
her
Get
up
let
us
go
But
there
was
no
answer
The
man
then
put
her
on
the
donkey
and
set
out
for
his
home
29
When
he
reached
his
house
he
took
the
slaughtering
knife
and
took
hold
of
his
concubine
and
cut
her
up
limb
by
limb
into
12
pieces
and
sent
one
piece
into
each
territory
of
Israel
30
All
who
saw
it
said
Such
a
thing
has
never
happened
or
been
seen
from
the
day
that
the
Israelites
went
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
down
to
this
day
Consider
it
take
counsel
and
tell
us
what
to
do
1
Consequently
all
the
Israelites
came
out
from
Dan
down
to
Beer-sheba
and
from
the
land
of
Gilead
and
the
entire
assembly
gathered
unitedly
before
Jehovah
at
Mizpah
2
So
the
chiefs
of
the
people
and
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
took
their
places
in
the
congregation
of
Gods
people—400000
foot
soldiers
armed
with
swords
3
The
Benjaminites
heard
that
the
men
of
Israel
had
gone
up
to
Mizpah
Then
the
men
of
Israel
said
Tell
us
how
did
this
terrible
thing
happen
4
At
this
the
Levite
man
the
husband
of
the
murdered
woman
said
in
answer
I
came
to
Gibeah
of
Benjamin
with
my
concubine
to
stay
overnight
5
And
the
inhabitants
of
Gibeah
rose
up
against
me
and
surrounded
the
house
by
night
They
meant
to
kill
me
but
they
raped
my
concubine
instead
and
she
died
6
So
I
took
my
concubines
body
and
cut
it
up
and
sent
the
pieces
into
every
part
of
Israels
inheritance
because
they
had
committed
a
shameful
and
disgraceful
act
in
Israel
7
Now
all
you
people
of
Israel
give
your
advice
and
counsel
here
8
Then
all
the
people
rose
up
in
unison
and
said
Not
one
of
us
will
go
to
his
tent
or
return
to
his
house
9
Now
this
is
what
we
will
do
to
Gibeah
We
will
go
up
against
it
by
lot
10
We
will
take
10
men
out
of
100
from
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
and
100
out
of
1000
and
1000
out
of
10000
to
collect
provisions
for
the
army
so
that
they
may
take
action
against
Gibeah
of
Benjamin
in
view
of
the
disgraceful
act
that
they
committed
in
Israel
11
Thus
all
the
men
of
Israel
were
gathered
against
the
city
united
as
allies
12
Then
the
tribes
of
Israel
sent
men
to
all
the
tribesmen
of
Benjamin
saying
What
is
this
terrible
thing
that
has
happened
among
you
13
Now
hand
over
the
worthless
men
from
Gibeah
so
that
we
may
put
them
to
death
and
clear
out
what
is
bad
from
Israel
But
the
Benjaminites
refused
to
listen
to
their
Israelite
brothers
14
Then
the
Benjaminites
gathered
together
out
of
the
cities
to
Gibeah
to
go
out
to
battle
against
the
men
of
Israel
15
That
day
the
Benjaminites
mustered
from
their
cities
26000
men
armed
with
swords
apart
from
the
700
chosen
men
of
Gibeah
16
In
this
army
were
700
chosen
men
who
were
left-handed
Every
one
of
these
men
could
sling
a
stone
to
within
a
hairbreadth
and
would
not
miss
17
The
men
of
Israel
apart
from
Benjamin
mustered
400000
men
armed
with
swords
and
each
one
was
an
experienced
warrior
18
They
rose
up
and
went
up
to
Bethel
to
inquire
of
God
Then
the
people
of
Israel
said
Who
of
us
should
go
up
in
the
lead
to
the
battle
against
the
Benjaminites
Jehovah
replied
Judah
is
to
take
the
lead
19
After
that
the
Israelites
rose
up
in
the
morning
and
camped
against
Gibeah
20
The
men
of
Israel
now
went
out
to
battle
against
Benjamin
they
drew
up
in
battle
formation
against
them
at
Gibeah
21
So
the
Benjaminites
came
out
from
Gibeah
and
struck
down
22000
men
of
Israel
on
that
day
22
However
the
army
of
the
men
of
Israel
showed
themselves
courageous
and
again
drew
up
in
battle
formation
in
the
same
place
as
on
the
first
day
23
Then
the
Israelites
went
up
and
wept
before
Jehovah
until
the
evening
and
inquired
of
Jehovah
Should
we
again
go
into
battle
against
our
brothers
the
people
of
Benjamin
To
this
Jehovah
said
Go
up
against
them
24
So
the
Israelites
drew
near
to
the
Benjaminites
on
the
second
day
25
In
turn
Benjamin
came
out
from
Gibeah
to
meet
them
on
the
second
day
and
struck
down
another
18000
Israelites
all
of
them
armed
with
swords
26
At
that
all
the
men
of
Israel
went
up
to
Bethel
They
wept
and
sat
there
before
Jehovah
and
they
fasted
on
that
day
until
the
evening
and
offered
up
burnt
offerings
and
communion
offerings
before
Jehovah
27
After
that
the
men
of
Israel
inquired
of
Jehovah
for
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
true
God
was
there
in
those
days
28
Now
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eleazar
the
son
of
Aaron
was
ministering
before
it
in
those
days
They
asked
Should
we
go
out
yet
again
to
battle
against
our
brothers
the
men
of
Benjamin
or
should
we
stop
Jehovah
replied
Go
up
because
tomorrow
I
will
give
them
into
your
hand
29
Then
Israel
set
men
in
ambush
all
around
Gibeah
30
The
Israelites
went
up
against
the
Benjaminites
on
the
third
day
and
they
drew
up
in
formation
against
Gibeah
the
same
as
at
the
other
times
31
When
the
Benjaminites
went
out
to
meet
the
army
they
were
drawn
away
from
the
city
Then
as
at
the
other
times
they
started
to
attack
and
kill
some
of
the
men
on
the
highways
one
of
which
goes
up
to
Bethel
and
the
other
to
Gibeah
leaving
about
30
men
of
Israel
dead
in
the
open
field
32
So
the
Benjaminites
said
They
are
suffering
defeat
before
us
the
same
as
before
But
the
Israelites
said
We
will
retreat
and
draw
them
away
from
the
city
onto
the
highways
33
So
all
the
men
of
Israel
rose
up
from
their
places
and
drew
up
in
formation
at
Baal-tamar
while
the
Israelite
ambush
charged
out
of
their
places
in
the
vicinity
of
Gibeah
34
Thus
10000
chosen
men
out
of
all
Israel
came
in
front
of
Gibeah
and
the
fighting
was
heavy
But
the
Benjaminites
did
not
know
that
disaster
was
near
at
hand
35
Jehovah
defeated
Benjamin
before
Israel
and
on
that
day
the
Israelites
struck
down
25100
men
in
Benjamin
all
of
them
armed
with
swords
36
However
the
Benjaminites
imagined
that
the
men
of
Israel
would
be
defeated
when
they
retreated
from
Benjamin
but
they
retreated
because
they
trusted
in
the
ambush
that
was
set
against
Gibeah
37
The
ambush
acted
quickly
and
charged
toward
Gibeah
Then
the
ambush
spread
out
and
struck
down
the
whole
city
with
the
sword
38
Now
the
men
of
Israel
had
arranged
that
the
men
who
ambushed
the
city
would
make
a
smoke
signal
go
up
from
there
39
When
the
Israelites
turned
around
in
the
battle
the
men
of
Benjamin
started
by
attacking
and
killing
about
30
men
of
Israel
and
they
said
They
are
clearly
suffering
another
defeat
before
us
just
as
in
the
previous
battle
40
But
the
signal
started
to
go
up
from
the
city
as
a
pillar
of
smoke
When
the
men
of
Benjamin
turned
to
look
they
saw
the
whole
city
going
up
in
flames
to
the
sky
41
Then
the
men
of
Israel
made
an
about-face
and
the
men
of
Benjamin
were
dismayed
for
they
saw
that
disaster
had
overtaken
them
42
So
they
retreated
from
the
men
of
Israel
toward
the
wilderness
but
the
battle
followed
them
the
men
coming
out
of
the
cities
joined
in
striking
them
down
43
They
surrounded
the
Benjaminites
and
pursued
them
relentlessly
They
trampled
them
down
directly
in
front
of
Gibeah
toward
the
east
44
Finally
18000
men
of
Benjamin
fell
all
mighty
warriors
45
The
men
of
Benjamin
turned
and
fled
into
the
wilderness
to
the
crag
of
Rimmon
and
the
Israelites
killed
5000
of
them
on
the
highways
and
they
kept
pursuing
them
as
far
as
Gidom
so
they
struck
down
2000
more
men
46
All
those
of
Benjamin
who
fell
on
that
day
amounted
to
25000
men
armed
with
swords
all
mighty
warriors
47
But
600
retreated
into
the
wilderness
to
the
crag
of
Rimmon
and
they
stayed
on
the
crag
of
Rimmon
for
four
months
48
And
the
men
of
Israel
turned
back
against
the
Benjaminites
and
struck
those
of
the
city
with
the
sword
from
men
to
livestock
all
that
remained
Also
they
set
all
the
cities
in
their
path
on
fire
1
Now
the
men
of
Israel
had
sworn
this
oath
in
Mizpah
Not
one
of
us
will
give
his
daughter
to
a
man
from
Benjamin
as
a
wife
2
Consequently
the
people
came
to
Bethel
and
sat
there
before
the
true
God
until
evening
crying
out
and
weeping
bitterly
3
And
they
were
saying
Why
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
has
this
happened
in
Israel
Why
should
one
tribe
be
missing
today
from
Israel
4
And
the
next
day
the
people
got
up
early
and
built
an
altar
there
to
offer
up
burnt
offerings
and
communion
offerings
5
Then
the
people
of
Israel
said
Who
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
did
not
come
up
to
assemble
before
Jehovah
for
they
had
taken
a
great
oath
that
anyone
who
did
not
come
up
to
Jehovah
at
Mizpah
would
be
put
to
death
without
fail
6
So
the
people
of
Israel
felt
sorrow
over
what
had
happened
to
Benjamin
their
brother
They
said
Today
one
tribe
has
been
chopped
off
from
Israel
7
What
should
we
do
to
provide
wives
for
those
who
are
left
now
that
we
have
sworn
by
Jehovah
not
to
give
them
any
of
our
daughters
as
wives
8
They
asked
Who
among
the
tribes
of
Israel
did
not
come
up
to
Jehovah
at
Mizpah
It
so
happened
that
no
one
had
come
from
Jabesh-gilead
into
the
camp
where
the
congregation
was
9
When
the
people
were
counted
they
saw
that
none
of
the
inhabitants
of
Jabesh-gilead
were
there
10
So
the
assembly
sent
there
12000
of
the
mightiest
men
They
commanded
them
Go
and
strike
down
the
inhabitants
of
Jabesh-gilead
with
the
sword
even
the
women
and
the
children
11
This
is
what
you
should
do
Every
male
as
well
as
every
woman
who
has
had
sexual
relations
with
a
male
you
should
devote
to
destruction
12
Among
the
inhabitants
of
Jabesh-gilead
they
found
400
girls
who
were
virgins
who
had
never
had
sexual
relations
with
a
man
So
they
brought
them
to
the
camp
at
Shiloh
which
is
in
the
land
of
Canaan
13
Then
all
the
assembly
sent
a
message
to
the
Benjaminites
on
the
crag
of
Rimmon
and
offered
them
peace
14
So
Benjamin
came
back
at
that
time
They
gave
them
the
women
whom
they
had
kept
alive
from
the
women
of
Jabesh-gilead
but
they
did
not
find
enough
for
them
15
And
the
people
felt
sorrow
over
what
had
happened
to
Benjamin
because
Jehovah
had
made
a
division
among
the
tribes
of
Israel
16
The
elders
of
the
assembly
said
What
should
we
do
to
provide
wives
for
the
remaining
men
since
all
the
women
were
annihilated
out
of
Benjamin
17
They
replied
There
should
be
an
inheritance
for
the
survivors
of
Benjamin
so
that
a
tribe
may
not
be
wiped
out
of
Israel
18
But
we
are
not
allowed
to
give
them
wives
from
our
daughters
because
the
people
of
Israel
have
sworn
Cursed
is
the
one
who
gives
a
wife
to
Benjamin
19
Then
they
said
Look
There
is
a
festival
of
Jehovah
from
year
to
year
in
Shiloh
which
is
north
of
Bethel
and
east
of
the
highway
that
goes
up
from
Bethel
to
Shechem
and
south
of
Lebonah
20
So
they
commanded
the
men
of
Benjamin
Go
and
set
an
ambush
in
the
vineyards
21
And
when
you
see
the
young
women
of
Shiloh
come
out
to
join
in
their
circle
dances
each
of
you
should
come
out
from
the
vineyards
and
seize
a
wife
from
the
young
women
of
Shiloh
and
you
should
return
to
the
land
of
Benjamin
22
And
should
their
fathers
or
their
brothers
come
to
make
a
complaint
against
us
we
will
then
tell
them
Show
us
favor
for
their
sakes
because
we
could
not
provide
each
one
a
wife
by
war
and
you
could
not
give
a
wife
to
them
without
becoming
guilty
23
So
the
men
of
Benjamin
did
just
that
and
they
each
carried
off
a
wife
from
the
women
who
were
dancing
After
that
they
went
back
to
their
inheritance
and
rebuilt
their
cities
and
settled
in
them
24
And
the
Israelites
dispersed
from
there
at
that
time
each
one
to
his
tribe
and
his
family
and
they
departed
from
there
each
one
to
his
inheritance
25
In
those
days
there
was
no
king
in
Israel
Each
one
was
doing
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
1
Now
in
the
days
when
the
judges
administered
justice
a
famine
occurred
in
the
land
and
a
man
went
from
Bethlehem
in
Judah
to
reside
as
a
foreigner
in
the
fields
of
Moab
he
along
with
his
wife
and
his
two
sons
2
The
mans
name
was
Elimelech
his
wifes
name
was
Naomi
and
the
names
of
his
two
sons
were
Mahlon
and
Chilion
They
were
Ephrathites
from
Bethlehem
in
Judah
And
they
came
to
the
fields
of
Moab
and
remained
there
3
After
some
time
Elimelech
Naomis
husband
died
and
she
was
left
with
her
two
sons
4
The
men
later
married
Moabite
women
one
was
named
Orpah
and
the
other
was
named
Ruth
They
remained
there
for
about
ten
years
5
Then
the
two
sons
Mahlon
and
Chilion
also
died
and
the
woman
was
left
without
her
two
children
and
her
husband
6
So
she
started
out
with
her
daughters-in-law
to
return
from
the
fields
of
Moab
for
she
had
heard
in
Moab
that
Jehovah
had
turned
his
attention
to
his
people
by
giving
them
food
7
She
left
the
place
where
she
had
been
living
with
both
of
her
daughters-in-law
As
they
were
walking
on
the
road
to
return
to
the
land
of
Judah
8
Naomi
said
to
both
of
her
daughters-in-law
Go
return
each
of
you
to
your
mothers
home
May
Jehovah
show
loyal
love
to
you
just
as
you
have
shown
it
to
the
men
who
have
died
and
to
me
9
May
Jehovah
grant
that
each
of
you
finds
security
in
the
home
of
your
husband
Then
she
kissed
them
and
they
wept
loudly
10
They
kept
saying
to
her
No
but
we
will
go
with
you
to
your
people
11
But
Naomi
said
Return
my
daughters
Why
should
you
go
with
me
Can
I
still
give
birth
to
sons
who
could
become
your
husbands
12
Return
my
daughters
Go
for
I
have
grown
too
old
to
marry
Even
if
I
could
hope
to
find
a
husband
tonight
and
could
also
bear
sons
13
would
you
keep
waiting
for
them
until
they
could
grow
up
Would
you
refrain
from
getting
remarried
for
their
sakes
No
my
daughters
I
feel
very
bitter
for
you
because
the
hand
of
Jehovah
has
turned
against
me
14
Again
they
wept
loudly
after
which
Orpah
kissed
her
mother-in-law
and
departed
But
Ruth
stuck
with
her
15
So
Naomi
said
Look
Your
widowed
sister-in-law
has
returned
to
her
people
and
her
gods
Return
with
your
sister-in-law
16
But
Ruth
said
Do
not
plead
with
me
to
abandon
you
to
turn
back
from
accompanying
you
for
where
you
go
I
will
go
and
where
you
spend
the
night
I
will
spend
the
night
Your
people
will
be
my
people
and
your
God
my
God
17
Where
you
die
I
will
die
and
there
I
will
be
buried
May
Jehovah
do
so
to
me
and
add
to
it
if
anything
but
death
should
separate
me
from
you
18
When
Naomi
saw
that
Ruth
insisted
on
going
with
her
she
stopped
trying
to
convince
her
19
And
they
both
continued
on
their
way
until
they
came
to
Bethlehem
As
soon
as
they
arrived
in
Bethlehem
the
whole
city
became
stirred
up
over
them
and
women
were
saying
Is
this
Naomi
20
She
would
say
to
the
women
Do
not
call
me
Naomi
Call
me
Mara
for
the
Almighty
has
made
life
very
bitter
for
me
21
I
was
full
when
I
went
but
Jehovah
made
me
return
empty-handed
Why
should
you
call
me
Naomi
when
it
is
Jehovah
who
opposed
me
and
the
Almighty
who
caused
me
calamity
22
This
is
how
Naomi
returned
from
the
fields
of
Moab
along
with
her
Moabite
daughter-in-law
Ruth
They
came
to
Bethlehem
at
the
beginning
of
the
barley
harvest
1
Now
Naomi
had
a
relative
on
her
husbands
side
who
was
very
wealthy
his
name
was
Boaz
and
he
was
of
the
family
of
Elimelech
2
Ruth
the
Moabitess
said
to
Naomi
Let
me
go
out
please
to
the
fields
and
glean
among
the
ears
of
grain
behind
whoever
looks
on
me
with
favor
So
Naomi
said
to
her
Go
my
daughter
3
At
that
she
went
out
and
began
to
glean
in
the
field
behind
the
harvesters
By
chance
she
came
upon
a
plot
of
land
belonging
to
Boaz
who
was
of
the
family
of
Elimelech
4
Just
then
Boaz
arrived
from
Bethlehem
and
said
to
the
harvesters
Jehovah
be
with
you
And
they
replied
Jehovah
bless
you
5
Boaz
then
asked
the
young
man
in
charge
of
the
harvesters
To
whom
does
this
young
woman
belong
6
The
young
man
in
charge
of
the
harvesters
answered
The
young
woman
is
a
Moabitess
who
returned
with
Naomi
from
the
fields
of
Moab
7
She
asked
Please
may
I
glean
and
gather
among
the
cut-off
ears
of
grain
left
behind
by
the
harvesters
And
she
has
been
on
her
feet
since
she
came
this
morning
until
just
now
when
she
sat
in
the
shelter
for
a
short
rest
8
Then
Boaz
said
to
Ruth
Listen
my
daughter
Do
not
go
away
to
glean
in
another
field
and
do
not
go
anywhere
else
stay
close
by
my
young
women
9
Keep
your
eyes
on
the
field
that
they
harvest
and
go
with
them
I
have
commanded
the
young
men
not
to
touch
you
When
you
are
thirsty
go
to
the
water
jars
and
drink
from
what
the
young
men
have
drawn
10
At
that
she
fell
facedown
and
bowed
down
to
the
ground
and
said
to
him
How
have
I
found
favor
in
your
eyes
and
why
have
you
taken
notice
of
me
when
I
am
a
foreigner
11
Boaz
answered
her
A
full
report
was
made
to
me
of
all
you
have
done
for
your
mother-in-law
after
the
death
of
your
husband
and
how
you
left
your
father
and
your
mother
and
the
land
of
your
relatives
to
go
to
a
people
whom
you
had
not
known
before
12
May
Jehovah
reward
you
for
what
you
have
done
and
may
there
be
a
perfect
wage
for
you
from
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
under
whose
wings
you
have
come
to
seek
refuge
13
To
this
she
said
Let
me
find
favor
in
your
eyes
my
lord
because
you
have
comforted
me
and
spoken
reassuringly
to
your
servant
although
I
am
not
even
one
of
your
servants
14
Boaz
said
to
her
at
mealtime
Come
here
eat
some
of
the
bread
and
dip
your
piece
in
the
vinegar
So
she
sat
down
beside
the
harvesters
He
then
handed
her
some
roasted
grain
and
she
ate
and
was
satisfied
and
she
had
something
left
over
15
When
she
got
up
to
glean
Boaz
commanded
his
young
men
Let
her
glean
even
among
the
cut-off
ears
of
grain
and
do
not
mistreat
her
16
You
should
also
be
sure
to
pull
out
some
ears
of
grain
from
the
bundles
for
her
and
leave
them
behind
for
her
to
glean
and
do
not
say
anything
to
stop
her
17
So
she
continued
to
glean
in
the
field
until
evening
When
she
beat
out
what
she
had
gleaned
it
came
to
about
an
ephah
of
barley
18
Then
she
took
it
and
went
into
the
city
and
her
mother-in-law
saw
what
she
had
gleaned
Ruth
also
took
out
and
gave
to
her
the
food
that
was
left
over
after
she
had
eaten
her
fill
19
Her
mother-in-law
then
said
to
her
Where
did
you
glean
today
Where
did
you
work
May
the
one
who
took
notice
of
you
be
blessed
So
she
told
her
mother-in-law
about
whom
she
had
worked
with
saying
The
name
of
the
man
I
worked
with
today
is
Boaz
20
At
that
Naomi
said
to
her
daughter-in-law
May
he
be
blessed
by
Jehovah
who
has
not
failed
in
his
loyal
love
toward
the
living
and
the
dead
Naomi
continued
The
man
is
related
to
us
He
is
one
of
our
repurchasers
21
Then
Ruth
the
Moabitess
said
He
also
told
me
Stay
close
by
my
young
people
until
they
have
finished
my
entire
harvest
22
Naomi
said
to
her
daughter-in-law
Ruth
It
is
better
my
daughter
for
you
to
go
out
with
his
young
women
than
to
be
harassed
in
another
field
23
So
she
stayed
close
to
the
young
women
of
Boaz
and
gleaned
until
the
barley
harvest
and
the
wheat
harvest
came
to
an
end
And
she
kept
dwelling
with
her
mother-in-law
1
Naomi
her
mother-in-law
now
said
to
her
My
daughter
should
I
not
look
for
a
home
for
you
so
that
it
may
go
well
with
you
2
Is
not
Boaz
our
relative
He
is
the
one
whose
young
women
you
were
with
Tonight
he
is
winnowing
barley
at
the
threshing
floor
3
So
wash
yourself
and
rub
on
some
perfumed
oil
then
dress
up
and
go
down
to
the
threshing
floor
Do
not
make
your
presence
known
to
the
man
until
he
has
finished
eating
and
drinking
4
When
he
lies
down
take
note
of
the
place
where
he
lies
down
then
go
and
uncover
his
feet
and
lie
down
He
will
tell
you
what
you
should
do
5
At
that
she
replied
All
that
you
say
to
me
I
will
do
6
So
she
went
down
to
the
threshing
floor
and
did
all
that
her
mother-in-law
had
instructed
her
to
do
7
Meanwhile
Boaz
ate
and
drank
and
was
feeling
good
at
heart
Then
he
went
to
lie
down
at
the
end
of
the
grain
heap
After
that
she
quietly
came
and
uncovered
his
feet
and
lay
down
8
At
midnight
the
man
began
to
shiver
and
he
leaned
forward
and
saw
a
woman
lying
at
his
feet
9
He
said
Who
are
you
She
replied
I
am
Ruth
your
servant
Spread
out
your
garment
over
your
servant
for
you
are
a
repurchaser
10
At
that
he
said
May
Jehovah
bless
you
my
daughter
You
have
shown
your
loyal
love
more
in
this
last
instance
than
in
the
first
instance
by
not
going
after
the
young
men
whether
poor
or
rich
11
And
now
my
daughter
have
no
fear
I
will
do
for
you
everything
that
you
say
for
everyone
in
the
city
knows
that
you
are
an
excellent
woman
12
While
it
is
true
that
I
am
a
repurchaser
there
is
a
repurchaser
more
closely
related
than
I
am
13
Stay
here
tonight
and
if
he
will
repurchase
you
in
the
morning
fine
Let
him
repurchase
you
But
if
he
does
not
want
to
repurchase
you
I
will
then
repurchase
you
myself
as
surely
as
Jehovah
lives
Lie
down
here
until
the
morning
14
So
she
lay
at
his
feet
until
the
morning
and
then
got
up
before
it
was
light
enough
for
anyone
to
be
recognized
He
then
said
Do
not
let
it
be
known
that
a
woman
came
to
the
threshing
floor
15
He
also
said
Bring
the
cloak
that
you
are
wearing
and
hold
it
out
So
she
held
it
out
and
he
put
six
measures
of
barley
in
it
and
put
it
on
her
after
which
he
went
into
the
city
16
She
went
her
way
to
her
mother-in-law
who
now
said
How
did
it
go
for
you
my
daughter
She
told
her
everything
that
the
man
had
done
for
her
17
She
added
He
gave
me
these
six
measures
of
barley
and
said
to
me
Do
not
go
empty-handed
to
your
mother-in-law
18
At
that
she
said
Sit
here
my
daughter
until
you
learn
how
the
matter
will
turn
out
for
the
man
will
not
rest
until
he
settles
the
matter
today
1
Now
Boaz
went
up
to
the
city
gate
and
sat
there
And
look
the
repurchaser
whom
Boaz
had
mentioned
passed
by
At
that
Boaz
said
Come
here
and
sit
down
So-and-so
And
he
went
over
and
sat
down
2
Then
Boaz
took
ten
of
the
city
elders
and
said
Sit
down
here
So
they
sat
down
3
Boaz
now
said
to
the
repurchaser
Naomi
who
has
returned
from
the
fields
of
Moab
must
sell
the
plot
of
land
that
belonged
to
our
brother
Elimelech
4
So
I
thought
I
should
disclose
it
to
you
and
say
Buy
it
in
front
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
elders
of
my
people
If
you
will
repurchase
it
repurchase
it
But
if
you
will
not
repurchase
it
tell
me
so
that
I
will
know
for
you
have
the
claim
to
repurchase
it
and
I
am
next
in
line
after
you
He
replied
I
am
willing
to
repurchase
it
5
Then
Boaz
said
On
the
day
you
buy
the
field
from
Naomi
you
must
also
buy
it
from
Ruth
the
Moabitess
the
wife
of
the
dead
man
in
order
to
restore
the
name
of
the
dead
man
to
his
inheritance
6
To
this
the
repurchaser
said
I
am
unable
to
repurchase
it
for
I
may
ruin
my
own
inheritance
Repurchase
it
for
yourself
with
my
right
of
repurchase
because
I
am
not
able
to
repurchase
it
7
Now
this
was
the
custom
of
former
times
in
Israel
concerning
the
right
of
repurchase
and
exchange
to
validate
every
sort
of
transaction
A
man
had
to
remove
his
sandal
and
give
it
to
the
other
party
and
this
was
the
manner
of
confirming
an
agreement
in
Israel
8
So
when
the
repurchaser
said
to
Boaz
Buy
it
for
yourself

he
removed
his
sandal
9
Then
Boaz
said
to
the
elders
and
all
the
people
You
are
witnesses
today
that
I
am
buying
from
Naomi
all
that
belonged
to
Elimelech
and
all
that
belonged
to
Chilion
and
Mahlon
10
I
am
also
acquiring
Ruth
the
Moabitess
the
wife
of
Mahlon
as
a
wife
to
restore
the
name
of
the
dead
man
to
his
inheritance
so
that
the
name
of
the
dead
man
will
not
be
cut
off
from
among
his
brothers
and
from
the
city
gate
of
his
home
You
are
witnesses
today
11
At
this
all
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
gate
and
the
elders
said
We
are
witnesses
May
Jehovah
grant
the
wife
who
is
entering
your
house
to
be
like
Rachel
and
like
Leah
both
of
whom
built
the
house
of
Israel
May
you
prosper
in
Ephrathah
and
make
a
good
name
in
Bethlehem
12
May
your
house
become
like
the
house
of
Perez
whom
Tamar
bore
to
Judah
through
the
offspring
that
Jehovah
will
give
you
by
this
young
woman
13
So
Boaz
took
Ruth
and
she
became
his
wife
He
had
relations
with
her
and
Jehovah
let
her
conceive
and
she
gave
birth
to
a
son
14
Then
the
women
said
to
Naomi
Praised
be
Jehovah
who
has
not
left
you
without
a
repurchaser
today
May
his
name
be
proclaimed
in
Israel
15
He
has
restored
your
life
and
will
sustain
you
in
your
old
age
because
he
has
been
born
to
your
daughter-in-law
who
loves
you
and
is
better
to
you
than
seven
sons
16
Naomi
took
the
child
and
held
him
to
her
bosom
and
she
cared
for
him
17
Then
the
neighbor
women
gave
him
a
name
They
said
A
son
has
been
born
to
Naomi

and
they
named
him
Obed
He
is
the
father
of
Jesse
Davids
father
18
Now
this
is
the
family
line
of
Perez
Perez
became
father
to
Hezron
19
Hezron
became
father
to
Ram
Ram
became
father
to
Amminadab
20
Amminadab
became
father
to
Nahshon
Nahshon
became
father
to
Salmon
21
Salmon
became
father
to
Boaz
Boaz
became
father
to
Obed
22
Obed
became
father
to
Jesse
and
Jesse
became
father
to
David
1
Now
there
was
a
man
of
Ramathaim-zophim
of
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
whose
name
was
Elkanah
the
son
of
Jeroham
the
son
of
Elihu
the
son
of
Tohu
the
son
of
Zuph
an
Ephraimite
2
He
had
two
wives
one
was
named
Hannah
and
the
other
was
named
Peninnah
Peninnah
had
children
but
Hannah
had
no
children
3
That
man
went
up
from
his
city
year
after
year
to
worship
and
to
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
of
armies
in
Shiloh
That
is
where
the
two
sons
of
Eli
Hophni
and
Phinehas
served
as
priests
to
Jehovah
4
One
day
when
Elkanah
offered
a
sacrifice
he
gave
portions
to
his
wife
Peninnah
as
well
as
to
all
her
sons
and
her
daughters
5
but
to
Hannah
he
gave
a
special
portion
because
Hannah
was
the
one
he
loved
but
Jehovah
had
not
given
her
children
6
Moreover
her
rival
wife
taunted
her
relentlessly
in
order
to
upset
her
because
Jehovah
had
not
given
her
children
7
That
is
what
she
would
do
year
after
year
whenever
Hannah
went
up
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
her
rival
would
taunt
her
so
much
that
she
would
weep
and
not
eat
8
But
her
husband
Elkanah
said
to
her
Hannah
why
do
you
weep
and
why
do
you
not
eat
and
why
are
you
so
sad
Am
I
not
better
to
you
than
ten
sons
9
Then
Hannah
got
up
after
they
had
finished
eating
and
drinking
in
Shiloh
At
the
time
Eli
the
priest
was
sitting
on
the
seat
by
the
doorpost
of
the
temple
of
Jehovah
10
Hannah
was
extremely
bitter
and
she
began
to
pray
to
Jehovah
and
to
weep
uncontrollably
11
And
she
made
this
vow
O
Jehovah
of
armies
if
you
look
upon
the
affliction
of
your
servant
and
remember
me
and
you
do
not
forget
your
servant
and
give
to
your
servant
a
male
child
I
will
give
him
to
Jehovah
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
no
razor
will
touch
his
head
12
While
she
prayed
for
a
long
time
before
Jehovah
Eli
was
watching
her
mouth
13
Hannah
was
speaking
in
her
heart
only
her
lips
were
trembling
but
her
voice
was
not
heard
So
Eli
thought
she
was
drunk
14
Eli
said
to
her
How
long
will
you
stay
drunk
Stop
drinking
your
wine
15
At
this
Hannah
answered
No
my
lord
I
am
a
woman
under
great
stress
I
have
not
drunk
wine
or
anything
alcoholic
but
I
am
pouring
out
my
soul
before
Jehovah
16
Do
not
take
your
servant
for
a
worthless
woman
for
I
have
been
speaking
until
now
out
of
my
great
anguish
and
distress
17
Then
Eli
answered
Go
in
peace
and
may
the
God
of
Israel
grant
your
petition
that
you
have
asked
of
him
18
To
this
she
said
Let
your
servant
find
favor
in
your
eyes
And
the
woman
went
on
her
way
and
ate
and
her
face
was
no
longer
downcast
19
Then
they
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
bowed
before
Jehovah
after
which
they
returned
to
their
house
in
Ramah
Elkanah
had
sexual
relations
with
his
wife
Hannah
and
Jehovah
gave
attention
to
her
20
Within
a
year
Hannah
became
pregnant
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
named
him
Samuel
because
as
she
said
it
is
from
Jehovah
that
I
have
asked
him
21
In
time
Elkanah
went
up
with
all
his
household
to
offer
the
yearly
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
and
to
present
his
vow
offering
22
But
Hannah
did
not
go
up
for
she
said
to
her
husband
As
soon
as
the
boy
is
weaned
I
will
bring
him
then
he
will
appear
before
Jehovah
and
remain
there
from
then
on
23
Elkanah
her
husband
then
said
to
her
Do
what
you
think
is
best
Stay
at
home
until
you
wean
him
May
Jehovah
carry
out
what
you
have
said
So
the
woman
stayed
at
home
and
nursed
her
son
until
she
weaned
him
24
As
soon
as
she
had
weaned
him
she
took
him
up
to
Shiloh
along
with
a
three-year-old
bull
one
ephah
of
flour
and
a
large
jar
of
wine
and
she
came
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
Shiloh
and
brought
the
young
boy
with
her
25
Then
they
slaughtered
the
bull
and
brought
the
boy
to
Eli
26
With
that
she
said
Pardon
me
my
lord
As
surely
as
you
live
my
lord
I
am
the
woman
who
was
standing
with
you
in
this
place
to
pray
to
Jehovah
27
It
was
for
this
boy
that
I
prayed
and
Jehovah
granted
my
petition
that
I
asked
of
him
28
I
in
turn
now
lend
him
to
Jehovah
For
all
his
days
he
is
lent
to
Jehovah
And
he
bowed
down
there
to
Jehovah
1
Then
Hannah
said
in
prayer
My
heart
rejoices
in
Jehovah
My
horn
is
exalted
by
Jehovah
My
mouth
is
opened
wide
against
my
enemies
For
I
rejoice
in
your
acts
of
salvation

2
There
is
no
one
holy
like
Jehovah
There
is
no
one
but
you
And
there
is
no
rock
like
our
God

3
Do
not
keep
speaking
with
haughtiness
Let
nothing
arrogant
come
from
your
mouth
For
Jehovah
is
a
God
of
knowledge
And
by
him
deeds
are
rightly
evaluated

4
The
bows
of
mighty
men
are
shattered
But
those
who
are
stumbling
are
given
strength

5
The
well-fed
must
hire
themselves
out
for
bread
But
the
hungry
hunger
no
more
The
barren
has
given
birth
to
seven
But
she
who
had
many
sons
has
become
desolate

6
Jehovah
kills
and
he
preserves
life
He
brings
down
to
the
Grave
and
he
raises
up

7
Jehovah
impoverishes
and
he
enriches
He
abases
and
he
exalts

8
He
raises
the
lowly
one
from
the
dust
He
lifts
up
the
poor
from
the
ash
heap
To
make
them
sit
with
princes
Giving
them
a
seat
of
honor
To
Jehovah
belong
earths
supports
And
he
places
the
productive
land
upon
them

9
He
guards
the
steps
of
his
loyal
ones
But
the
wicked
will
be
silenced
in
darkness
For
not
by
power
does
a
man
prevail
10
Jehovah
will
shatter
those
fighting
against
him
He
will
thunder
against
them
from
the
heavens
Jehovah
will
judge
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
He
will
give
power
to
his
kingAnd
exalt
the
horn
of
his
anointed
one
11
Then
Elkanah
went
to
his
house
in
Ramah
but
the
boy
became
a
minister
of
Jehovah
before
Eli
the
priest
12
Now
the
sons
of
Eli
were
wicked
men
they
had
no
regard
for
Jehovah
13
This
is
what
they
did
with
the
due
right
of
the
priests
from
the
people
Whenever
any
man
was
offering
a
sacrifice
an
attendant
of
the
priest
came
with
a
three-pronged
fork
in
his
hand
when
the
meat
was
boiling
14
and
he
would
thrust
it
into
the
basin
the
two-handled
cooking
pot
the
cauldron
or
the
one-handled
cooking
pot
Whatever
the
fork
brought
up
the
priest
would
take
for
himself
That
is
what
they
would
do
in
Shiloh
to
all
the
Israelites
coming
there
15
Also
even
before
the
man
sacrificing
could
make
the
fat
smoke
an
attendant
of
the
priest
would
come
and
say
to
him
Give
the
priest
meat
to
roast
He
will
not
take
boiled
meat
from
you
only
raw
meat
16
When
the
man
would
say
to
him
Let
them
first
be
sure
to
make
the
fat
smoke
then
take
for
yourself
whatever
you
desire

he
would
say
No
give
it
to
me
now
if
not
I
will
take
it
by
force
17
Thus
the
sin
of
the
attendants
came
to
be
very
great
before
Jehovah
for
the
men
treated
the
offering
of
Jehovah
with
disrespect
18
Now
Samuel
was
ministering
before
Jehovah
wearing
a
linen
ephod
though
he
was
just
a
boy
19
Also
his
mother
would
make
for
him
a
little
sleeveless
coat
and
she
brought
it
up
to
him
year
after
year
when
she
came
up
with
her
husband
to
offer
the
yearly
sacrifice
20
And
Eli
blessed
Elkanah
and
his
wife
and
said
May
Jehovah
grant
you
a
child
from
this
wife
in
place
of
the
one
who
was
lent
to
Jehovah
And
they
went
back
home
21
Jehovah
turned
his
attention
to
Hannah
so
that
she
could
conceive
and
she
gave
birth
to
three
more
sons
and
two
daughters
And
the
boy
Samuel
continued
growing
up
before
Jehovah
22
Now
Eli
was
very
old
but
he
had
heard
about
everything
that
his
sons
were
doing
to
all
Israel
and
how
they
would
lie
down
with
the
women
who
served
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
of
meeting
23
He
used
to
say
to
them
Why
do
you
keep
doing
things
like
these
For
the
things
I
am
hearing
about
you
from
all
the
people
are
bad
24
No
my
sons
the
report
that
I
hear
circulating
among
the
people
of
Jehovah
is
not
good
25
If
a
man
should
sin
against
another
man
someone
may
appeal
to
Jehovah
for
him
but
if
a
man
should
sin
against
Jehovah
who
can
pray
for
him
But
they
refused
to
listen
to
their
father
for
Jehovah
had
determined
to
put
them
to
death
26
Meanwhile
the
boy
Samuel
kept
growing
in
stature
and
in
favor
both
with
Jehovah
and
with
the
people
27
A
man
of
God
came
to
Eli
and
said
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Did
I
not
plainly
reveal
myself
to
your
fathers
house
while
they
were
in
Egypt
as
slaves
to
the
house
of
Pharaoh
28
And
he
was
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
serve
as
my
priest
and
to
go
up
on
my
altar
to
make
sacrifices
to
offer
incense
and
to
bear
an
ephod
before
me
and
I
gave
to
the
house
of
your
forefather
all
the
offerings
made
by
fire
of
the
Israelites
29
Why
do
you
men
scorn
my
sacrifice
and
my
offering
that
I
have
commanded
in
my
place
of
dwelling
Why
do
you
keep
honoring
your
sons
more
than
me
by
fattening
yourselves
from
the
best
portions
of
every
offering
of
my
people
Israel
30
That
is
why
the
word
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
is
I
did
indeed
say
that
your
house
and
the
house
of
your
forefather
would
always
walk
before
me
But
now
Jehovah
declares
It
is
unthinkable
on
my
part
because
those
honoring
me
I
will
honor
but
those
despising
me
will
be
treated
with
contempt
31
Look
Days
are
coming
when
I
will
cut
off
your
strength
and
that
of
your
fathers
house
so
that
no
man
in
your
house
will
live
to
old
age
32
And
you
will
look
upon
a
rival
in
my
dwelling
amid
all
the
good
that
is
done
to
Israel
and
never
again
will
there
be
an
old
man
in
your
house
33
The
man
of
yours
whom
I
do
not
cut
off
from
serving
at
my
altar
will
cause
your
eyes
to
fail
and
will
bring
you
grief
but
the
greater
number
of
your
house
will
die
by
the
sword
of
men
34
And
what
happens
to
your
two
sons
Hophni
and
Phinehas
will
be
the
sign
for
you
On
one
day
both
of
them
will
die
35
Then
I
will
raise
up
for
myself
a
faithful
priest
He
will
act
in
harmony
with
what
is
my
hearts
desire
and
I
will
build
for
him
a
lasting
house
and
he
will
walk
before
my
anointed
one
always
36
Anyone
who
remains
in
your
house
will
come
and
bow
down
to
him
for
the
payment
of
money
and
a
loaf
of
bread
and
will
say
Assign
me
please
to
one
of
the
priestly
offices
to
eat
a
piece
of
bread
1
Meanwhile
the
boy
Samuel
was
ministering
to
Jehovah
before
Eli
but
word
from
Jehovah
had
become
rare
in
those
days
visions
were
not
widespread
2
One
day
Eli
was
lying
down
in
his
usual
place
and
his
eyes
had
grown
dim
he
was
not
able
to
see
3
The
lamp
of
God
had
not
yet
been
extinguished
and
Samuel
was
lying
in
the
temple
of
Jehovah
where
the
Ark
of
God
was
4
Jehovah
then
called
Samuel
He
answered
Here
I
am
5
He
ran
to
Eli
and
said
Here
I
am
for
you
called
me
But
he
said
I
did
not
call
Lie
down
again
So
he
went
and
lay
down
6
Jehovah
called
once
again
Samuel
At
this
Samuel
got
up
and
went
to
Eli
and
said
Here
I
am
for
you
called
me
But
he
said
I
did
not
call
my
son
Lie
down
again
7
Now
Samuel
had
not
yet
come
to
know
Jehovah
and
the
word
of
Jehovah
had
not
yet
been
revealed
to
him
8
So
Jehovah
called
again
a
third
time
Samuel
At
that
he
got
up
and
went
to
Eli
and
said
Here
I
am
for
you
called
me
Eli
then
realized
that
it
was
Jehovah
who
was
calling
the
boy
9
So
Eli
said
to
Samuel
Go
lie
down
and
if
he
calls
you
you
should
say
Speak
Jehovah
for
your
servant
is
listening
And
Samuel
went
and
lay
down
in
his
place
10
Jehovah
came
and
stood
there
and
he
called
as
at
the
other
times
Samuel
Samuel
At
this
Samuel
said
Speak
for
your
servant
is
listening
11
Jehovah
said
to
Samuel
Look
I
am
doing
something
in
Israel
that
will
make
both
ears
of
anyone
who
hears
about
it
tingle
12
On
that
day
I
will
carry
out
toward
Eli
all
that
I
said
about
his
house
from
start
to
finish
13
You
must
tell
him
that
I
am
bringing
a
lasting
judgment
on
his
house
for
the
error
that
he
has
known
about
for
his
sons
are
cursing
God
but
he
has
not
rebuked
them
14
That
is
why
I
have
sworn
to
the
house
of
Eli
that
the
error
of
the
house
of
Eli
will
never
be
atoned
for
by
sacrifices
or
by
offerings
15
Samuel
lay
down
until
the
morning
then
he
opened
the
doors
of
Jehovahs
house
Samuel
was
afraid
to
tell
Eli
of
the
vision
16
But
Eli
called
for
Samuel
Samuel
my
son
At
this
he
said
Here
I
am
17
He
asked
What
message
did
he
speak
to
you
Please
do
not
hide
it
from
me
May
God
do
so
to
you
and
add
to
it
if
you
hide
from
me
a
single
word
of
all
that
he
said
to
you
18
So
Samuel
told
him
everything
and
he
did
not
hide
anything
from
him
Eli
said
It
is
Jehovah
Let
him
do
what
is
good
in
his
eyes
19
Samuel
continued
growing
up
and
Jehovah
himself
was
with
him
and
did
not
let
any
of
all
his
words
go
unfulfilled
20
All
Israel
from
Dan
to
Beer-sheba
became
aware
that
Samuel
had
been
confirmed
as
Jehovahs
prophet
21
And
Jehovah
continued
to
appear
in
Shiloh
for
Jehovah
revealed
himself
to
Samuel
in
Shiloh
by
the
word
of
Jehovah
1
And
the
word
of
Samuel
went
out
to
all
Israel
Then
Israel
went
out
to
meet
the
Philistines
in
battle
they
camped
beside
Ebenezer
and
the
Philistines
were
encamped
at
Aphek
2
The
Philistines
drew
up
in
battle
formation
to
meet
Israel
but
the
battle
went
badly
and
Israel
was
defeated
by
the
Philistines
who
struck
down
about
4000
men
from
the
battle
line
in
the
field
3
When
the
people
returned
to
the
camp
the
elders
of
Israel
said
Why
did
Jehovah
allow
us
to
be
defeated
today
by
the
Philistines
Let
us
take
the
ark
of
Jehovahs
covenant
with
us
from
Shiloh
so
that
it
may
be
with
us
and
save
us
from
the
hand
of
our
enemies
4
So
the
people
sent
men
to
Shiloh
and
they
carried
from
there
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
of
armies
who
sits
enthroned
above
the
cherubs
The
two
sons
of
Eli
Hophni
and
Phinehas
were
also
there
with
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
true
God
5
As
soon
as
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
came
into
the
camp
all
the
Israelites
broke
out
into
loud
shouting
so
that
the
earth
shook
6
When
the
Philistines
heard
the
sound
of
the
shouting
they
said
Why
is
there
such
loud
shouting
in
the
camp
of
the
Hebrews
Finally
they
learned
that
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
had
come
into
the
camp
7
The
Philistines
became
afraid
for
they
said
God
has
come
into
the
camp
So
they
said
Too
bad
for
us
for
nothing
like
this
has
ever
happened
before
8
Too
bad
for
us
Who
will
save
us
from
the
hand
of
this
majestic
God
This
is
the
God
who
struck
Egypt
with
every
sort
of
slaughter
in
the
wilderness
9
Be
courageous
and
act
like
men
you
Philistines
so
that
you
may
not
serve
the
Hebrews
just
as
they
have
served
you
Act
like
men
and
fight
10
So
the
Philistines
fought
and
Israel
was
defeated
and
each
one
fled
to
his
tent
The
slaughter
was
very
great
on
Israels
side
30000
foot
soldiers
fell
11
Moreover
the
Ark
of
God
was
captured
and
the
two
sons
of
Eli
Hophni
and
Phinehas
died
12
A
man
of
Benjamin
ran
from
the
battle
line
and
arrived
at
Shiloh
on
that
day
with
his
garments
ripped
apart
and
dirt
on
his
head
13
When
the
man
arrived
Eli
was
sitting
on
the
seat
by
the
roadside
watching
because
his
heart
was
trembling
over
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
The
man
went
into
the
city
to
report
the
news
and
the
whole
city
began
crying
out
14
When
Eli
heard
the
sound
of
the
outcry
he
asked
What
does
the
sound
of
this
turmoil
mean
The
same
man
hurried
in
and
reported
the
news
to
Eli
15
Now
Eli
was
98
years
old
and
his
eyes
stared
straight
ahead
and
he
could
not
see
16
Then
the
man
said
to
Eli
I
am
the
one
who
came
from
the
battle
line
Just
today
I
fled
from
the
battle
line
At
this
he
asked
What
happened
my
son
17
So
the
bearer
of
the
news
related
Israel
has
fled
from
the
Philistines
and
there
was
a
great
defeat
among
the
people
also
your
own
two
sons
Hophni
and
Phinehas
have
died
and
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
has
been
captured
18
At
the
moment
he
mentioned
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
Eli
fell
backward
from
his
seat
beside
the
gate
and
his
neck
was
broken
and
he
died
for
he
was
old
and
heavy
He
had
judged
Israel
for
40
years
19
His
daughter-in-law
the
wife
of
Phinehas
was
pregnant
and
close
to
giving
birth
When
she
heard
the
report
that
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
had
been
captured
and
that
her
father-in-law
and
her
husband
had
died
she
doubled
over
and
unexpectedly
went
into
labor
and
gave
birth
20
As
she
was
dying
the
women
standing
by
her
said
Do
not
be
afraid
for
you
have
given
birth
to
a
son
She
did
not
answer
and
did
not
pay
attention
to
it
21
But
she
named
the
boy
Ichabod
saying
Glory
has
gone
away
from
Israel
into
exile

referring
to
the
capture
of
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
and
what
happened
to
her
father-in-law
and
her
husband
22
She
said
Glory
has
gone
away
from
Israel
into
exile
because
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
has
been
captured
1
When
the
Philistines
captured
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
they
brought
it
from
Ebenezer
to
Ashdod
2
The
Philistines
took
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
and
brought
it
into
the
house
of
Dagon
and
set
it
beside
Dagon
3
When
the
Ashdodites
got
up
early
the
next
day
there
was
Dagon
fallen
facedown
on
the
ground
before
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
So
they
took
Dagon
and
returned
him
to
his
place
4
When
they
got
up
early
in
the
morning
on
the
following
day
there
was
Dagon
fallen
facedown
on
the
ground
before
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
The
head
of
Dagon
and
the
palms
of
both
his
hands
were
cut
off
and
were
lying
on
the
threshold
Only
the
fish
part
had
been
left
intact
5
That
is
why
to
this
day
the
priests
of
Dagon
and
all
those
who
enter
the
house
of
Dagon
do
not
walk
on
the
threshold
of
Dagon
in
Ashdod
6
The
hand
of
Jehovah
was
heavy
against
the
Ashdodites
and
he
devastated
them
by
striking
Ashdod
and
its
territories
with
piles
7
When
the
men
of
Ashdod
saw
what
was
happening
they
said
Do
not
let
the
Ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
remain
with
us
for
his
hand
has
dealt
harshly
with
us
and
our
god
Dagon
8
So
they
sent
for
and
gathered
all
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
and
asked
them
What
should
we
do
with
the
Ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
They
replied
Let
the
Ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
be
moved
to
Gath
So
they
moved
the
Ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
there
9
After
they
moved
it
there
the
hand
of
Jehovah
came
against
the
city
bringing
great
panic
He
struck
the
men
of
the
city
from
small
to
great
and
piles
broke
out
on
them
10
So
they
sent
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
to
Ekron
but
as
soon
as
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
came
to
Ekron
the
Ekronites
began
to
cry
out
They
have
brought
the
Ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
to
us
to
put
us
and
our
people
to
death
11
Then
they
sent
for
and
gathered
all
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
and
said
Send
the
Ark
of
the
God
of
Israel
away
let
it
return
to
its
place
so
that
we
and
our
people
may
not
be
put
to
death
For
the
terror
of
death
had
spread
through
the
whole
city
the
hand
of
the
true
God
had
been
very
heavy
there
12
and
the
men
who
did
not
die
had
been
struck
with
piles
And
the
citys
cry
for
help
ascended
to
the
heavens
1
The
Ark
of
Jehovah
was
in
Philistine
territory
for
seven
months
2
The
Philistines
called
the
priests
and
the
diviners
and
asked
What
should
we
do
with
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
Let
us
know
how
we
should
send
it
back
to
its
place
3
They
replied
If
you
send
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
away
do
not
send
it
back
without
an
offering
You
should
by
all
means
return
to
him
a
guilt
offering
Only
then
will
you
be
healed
and
it
will
be
made
known
to
you
why
his
hand
has
not
turned
away
from
you
4
So
they
asked
What
guilt
offering
should
we
send
to
him
They
said
According
to
the
number
of
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
send
five
golden
piles
and
five
golden
mice
for
the
same
scourge
has
afflicted
every
one
of
you
and
your
lords
5
You
should
make
images
of
your
piles
and
images
of
your
mice
that
are
bringing
the
land
to
ruin
and
you
should
honor
the
God
of
Israel
Perhaps
he
will
lighten
the
weight
of
his
hand
that
is
on
you
and
your
god
and
your
land
6
Why
should
you
harden
your
heart
as
Egypt
and
Pharaoh
hardened
their
hearts
When
He
dealt
harshly
with
them
they
had
to
send
Israel
away
and
they
departed
7
Now
prepare
a
new
wagon
and
two
cows
that
have
calves
and
have
never
been
under
a
yoke
Then
hitch
the
cows
to
the
wagon
but
take
their
calves
back
home
away
from
them
8
Take
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
and
place
it
on
the
wagon
and
put
the
golden
articles
that
you
are
sending
to
him
as
a
guilt
offering
in
a
box
next
to
it
Then
send
it
on
its
way
9
and
watch
If
it
goes
up
the
road
to
Beth-shemesh
to
its
own
territory
then
he
is
the
one
who
has
done
this
great
evil
to
us
But
if
not
we
will
know
that
it
was
not
his
hand
that
struck
us
it
happened
to
us
by
coincidence
10
The
men
did
accordingly
They
took
two
cows
that
had
calves
and
hitched
them
to
the
wagon
and
the
calves
they
penned
up
at
home
11
Then
they
put
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
on
the
wagon
as
well
as
the
box
containing
the
golden
mice
and
the
images
of
their
piles
12
And
the
cows
went
straight
ahead
on
the
road
to
Beth-shemesh
They
stayed
on
the
one
highway
mooing
as
they
went
they
did
not
turn
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
All
the
while
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
were
walking
behind
them
as
far
as
the
boundary
of
Beth-shemesh
13
The
people
of
Beth-shemesh
were
reaping
the
wheat
harvest
in
the
valley
plain
When
they
raised
their
eyes
and
saw
the
Ark
they
were
overjoyed
at
seeing
it
14
The
wagon
came
into
the
field
of
Joshua
the
Beth-shemite
and
stopped
there
near
a
large
stone
So
they
chopped
up
the
wood
of
the
wagon
and
they
offered
the
cows
as
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
15
The
Levites
took
down
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
and
the
box
that
was
with
it
which
contained
the
golden
articles
and
they
put
them
on
the
large
stone
The
men
of
Beth-shemesh
offered
up
burnt
offerings
and
made
sacrifices
on
that
day
to
Jehovah
16
When
the
five
lords
of
the
Philistines
saw
it
they
returned
to
Ekron
on
that
day
17
Now
these
are
the
golden
piles
that
the
Philistines
sent
as
a
guilt
offering
to
Jehovah
one
for
Ashdod
one
for
Gaza
one
for
Ashkelon
one
for
Gath
one
for
Ekron
18
And
the
number
of
the
golden
mice
corresponded
to
the
number
of
all
the
cities
of
the
Philistines
that
belonged
to
the
five
lords—both
the
fortified
cities
and
the
villages
in
the
open
country
And
the
large
stone
upon
which
they
rested
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
serves
as
a
witness
down
to
this
day
in
the
field
of
Joshua
the
Beth-shemite
19
But
God
struck
down
the
men
of
Beth-shemesh
because
they
had
looked
upon
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
He
struck
down
50070
among
the
people
and
the
people
began
mourning
because
Jehovah
had
struck
them
down
with
a
great
slaughter
20
So
the
men
of
Beth-shemesh
asked
Who
will
be
able
to
stand
before
Jehovah
this
holy
God
and
to
whom
will
he
go
away
from
us
21
So
they
sent
messengers
to
the
inhabitants
of
Kiriath-jearim
saying
The
Philistines
have
returned
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
Come
down
and
take
it
up
with
you
1
So
the
men
of
Kiriath-jearim
came
and
took
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
up
into
the
house
of
Abinadab
on
the
hill
and
they
sanctified
his
son
Eleazar
to
guard
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
2
A
long
time
elapsed
20
years
in
all
from
the
day
of
the
Arks
coming
to
Kiriath-jearim
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
began
to
seek
after
Jehovah
3
Samuel
then
said
to
all
the
house
of
Israel
If
you
are
returning
to
Jehovah
with
all
your
heart
put
away
the
foreign
gods
and
the
Ashtoreth
images
from
among
you
and
direct
your
heart
unswervingly
to
Jehovah
and
serve
only
him
and
he
will
rescue
you
from
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
4
At
that
the
Israelites
got
rid
of
the
Baals
and
the
Ashtoreth
images
and
served
only
Jehovah
5
Then
Samuel
said
Gather
all
Israel
together
at
Mizpah
and
I
will
pray
to
Jehovah
in
your
behalf
6
So
they
gathered
together
at
Mizpah
and
they
drew
water
and
poured
it
out
before
Jehovah
and
kept
a
fast
on
that
day
There
they
said
We
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
And
Samuel
began
serving
as
judge
over
the
Israelites
in
Mizpah
7
When
the
Philistines
heard
that
the
Israelites
had
gathered
together
at
Mizpah
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
went
up
against
Israel
When
the
Israelites
heard
of
it
they
were
afraid
because
of
the
Philistines
8
So
the
Israelites
said
to
Samuel
Do
not
stop
calling
to
Jehovah
our
God
to
help
us
and
to
save
us
from
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
9
Then
Samuel
took
a
suckling
lamb
and
offered
it
up
as
a
whole
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
and
Samuel
called
to
Jehovah
for
help
in
behalf
of
Israel
and
Jehovah
answered
him
10
As
Samuel
was
offering
up
the
burnt
offering
the
Philistines
advanced
for
battle
against
Israel
Jehovah
now
caused
it
to
thunder
loudly
on
that
day
against
the
Philistines
and
He
threw
them
into
confusion
and
they
were
defeated
before
Israel
11
At
that
the
men
of
Israel
went
out
from
Mizpah
and
pursued
the
Philistines
striking
them
down
as
far
as
south
of
Beth-car
12
Then
Samuel
took
a
stone
and
set
it
between
Mizpah
and
Jeshanah
and
named
it
Ebenezer
for
he
said
Until
now
Jehovah
has
helped
us
13
Thus
the
Philistines
were
subdued
and
they
did
not
come
again
into
the
territory
of
Israel
and
the
hand
of
Jehovah
continued
against
the
Philistines
all
the
days
of
Samuel
14
Also
the
cities
that
the
Philistines
had
taken
from
Israel
were
returned
to
Israel
from
Ekron
to
Gath
and
Israel
recovered
their
territory
from
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
There
was
also
peace
between
Israel
and
the
Amorites
15
Samuel
kept
on
judging
Israel
throughout
his
life
16
Each
year
he
traveled
in
a
circuit
to
Bethel
Gilgal
and
Mizpah
and
he
judged
Israel
in
all
these
places
17
But
he
would
return
to
Ramah
because
his
house
was
there
and
there
he
also
judged
Israel
He
built
an
altar
there
to
Jehovah
1
When
Samuel
had
grown
old
he
appointed
his
sons
as
judges
for
Israel
2
The
name
of
his
firstborn
son
was
Joel
and
the
name
of
his
second
Abijah
they
were
judges
in
Beer-sheba
3
But
his
sons
did
not
walk
in
his
ways
they
were
inclined
to
pursue
dishonest
profit
they
accepted
bribes
and
they
perverted
justice
4
In
time
all
the
elders
of
Israel
gathered
together
and
came
to
Samuel
at
Ramah
5
They
said
to
him
Look
You
have
grown
old
but
your
sons
are
not
walking
in
your
ways
Now
appoint
for
us
a
king
to
judge
us
like
all
the
other
nations
6
But
it
displeased
Samuel
when
they
said
Give
us
a
king
to
judge
us
Then
Samuel
prayed
to
Jehovah
7
and
Jehovah
said
to
Samuel
Listen
to
everything
the
people
say
to
you
for
it
is
not
you
whom
they
have
rejected
but
it
is
I
whom
they
have
rejected
as
their
king
8
They
are
doing
just
as
they
have
done
from
the
day
I
brought
them
up
out
of
Egypt
until
this
day
they
keep
forsaking
me
and
serving
other
gods
and
that
is
what
they
are
doing
to
you
9
Now
listen
to
them
However
you
should
solemnly
warn
them
tell
them
what
the
king
who
rules
over
them
will
have
the
right
to
demand
10
So
Samuel
told
the
people
who
were
asking
him
for
a
king
all
the
words
of
Jehovah
11
He
said
This
is
what
the
king
who
rules
over
you
will
have
the
right
to
demand
He
will
take
your
sons
and
put
them
in
his
chariots
and
make
them
his
horsemen
and
some
will
have
to
run
before
his
chariots
12
And
he
will
appoint
for
himself
chiefs
over
thousands
and
chiefs
over
fifties
and
some
will
do
his
plowing
reap
his
harvest
and
make
his
weapons
of
war
and
equipment
for
his
chariots
13
He
will
take
your
daughters
to
be
ointment
mixers
cooks
and
bakers
14
He
will
take
the
best
of
your
fields
your
vineyards
and
your
olive
groves
and
he
will
give
them
to
his
servants
15
He
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
grainfields
and
your
vineyards
and
he
will
give
it
to
his
court
officials
and
his
servants
16
And
he
will
take
your
male
and
female
servants
your
best
herds
and
your
donkeys
and
he
will
use
them
for
his
work
17
He
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
flocks
and
you
will
become
his
servants
18
The
day
will
come
when
you
will
cry
out
because
of
the
king
you
have
chosen
for
yourselves
but
Jehovah
will
not
answer
you
in
that
day
19
However
the
people
refused
to
listen
to
what
Samuel
told
them
and
they
said
No
we
are
determined
to
have
a
king
over
us
20
Then
we
will
be
like
all
the
other
nations
and
our
king
will
judge
us
and
lead
us
and
fight
our
battles
21
After
Samuel
heard
all
the
words
of
the
people
he
repeated
them
in
the
hearing
of
Jehovah
22
Jehovah
said
to
Samuel
Listen
to
them
and
appoint
a
king
to
reign
over
them
Samuel
then
said
to
the
men
of
Israel
Each
of
you
should
return
to
his
city
1
There
was
a
man
of
Benjamin
named
Kish
the
son
of
Abiel
the
son
of
Zeror
son
of
Becorath
son
of
Aphiah
a
Benjaminite
and
a
very
wealthy
man
2
He
had
a
son
named
Saul
who
was
young
and
handsome—there
was
no
man
among
the
Israelites
more
handsome
than
he—and
he
stood
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
all
the
people
3
When
the
donkeys
belonging
to
Sauls
father
Kish
got
lost
Kish
said
to
his
son
Saul
Please
take
with
you
one
of
the
attendants
and
go
look
for
the
donkeys
4
They
passed
through
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
and
through
the
land
of
Shalishah
and
they
did
not
find
them
They
traveled
through
the
land
of
Shaalim
but
the
donkeys
were
not
there
They
passed
through
the
entire
land
of
the
Benjaminites
and
they
did
not
find
them
5
They
came
into
the
land
of
Zuph
and
Saul
said
to
his
attendant
who
was
with
him
Come
let
us
return
so
that
my
father
does
not
start
worrying
about
us
rather
than
the
donkeys
6
But
the
attendant
replied
Look
there
is
a
man
of
God
in
this
city
a
man
who
is
held
in
honor
All
that
he
says
is
sure
to
come
true
Let
us
go
there
now
Perhaps
he
can
tell
us
which
way
to
go
7
At
this
Saul
said
to
his
attendant
If
we
go
what
can
we
take
to
the
man
There
is
no
bread
in
our
bags
there
is
nothing
to
take
as
a
gift
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
What
do
we
have
8
So
the
attendant
answered
Saul
again
Look
There
is
a
quarter
of
a
shekel
of
silver
in
my
hand
I
will
give
it
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
and
he
will
tell
us
which
way
to
go
9
In
former
times
in
Israel
this
was
what
a
man
would
say
when
going
to
seek
God
Come
and
let
us
go
to
the
seer
For
the
prophet
of
today
used
to
be
called
a
seer
in
former
times
10
Then
Saul
said
to
his
attendant
What
you
said
is
good
Let
us
go
So
they
went
to
the
city
where
the
man
of
the
true
God
was
11
While
they
were
going
up
the
ascent
to
the
city
they
met
girls
going
out
to
draw
water
So
they
said
to
them
Is
the
seer
in
this
place
12
They
answered
He
is
Look
he
is
just
ahead
of
you
Hurry
now
for
today
he
has
come
to
the
city
because
the
people
are
making
a
sacrifice
today
on
the
high
place
13
As
soon
as
you
come
into
the
city
you
will
find
him
before
he
goes
up
to
the
high
place
to
eat
The
people
will
not
eat
until
he
comes
for
he
is
the
one
who
blesses
the
sacrifice
Once
that
is
done
those
who
are
invited
may
eat
So
now
go
up
right
away
and
you
will
find
him
14
So
they
went
up
to
the
city
As
they
were
coming
into
the
middle
of
the
city
there
was
Samuel
coming
out
to
meet
them
to
go
up
to
the
high
place
15
The
day
before
Saul
came
Jehovah
had
told
Samuel
16
Tomorrow
about
this
time
I
will
send
to
you
a
man
from
the
land
of
Benjamin
You
must
anoint
him
as
leader
over
my
people
Israel
and
he
will
save
my
people
from
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
For
I
have
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people
and
their
outcry
has
reached
me
17
When
Samuel
saw
Saul
Jehovah
told
him
Here
is
the
man
of
whom
I
said
to
you
This
is
the
one
who
will
govern
my
people
18
Then
Saul
approached
Samuel
in
the
middle
of
the
gate
and
said
Tell
me
please
where
is
the
house
of
the
seer
19
Samuel
answered
Saul
I
am
the
seer
Go
up
ahead
of
me
to
the
high
place
and
you
will
eat
with
me
today
I
will
send
you
away
in
the
morning
and
I
will
tell
you
all
that
you
want
to
know
20
As
for
the
donkeys
that
were
lost
three
days
ago
do
not
worry
about
them
for
they
have
been
found
And
to
whom
does
all
that
is
desirable
of
Israel
belong
Is
it
not
to
you
and
to
the
whole
house
of
your
father
21
At
this
Saul
answered
Am
I
not
a
Benjaminite
of
the
smallest
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
and
my
family
the
most
insignificant
of
all
the
families
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
So
why
have
you
spoken
to
me
in
this
way
22
Then
Samuel
took
Saul
and
his
attendant
and
brought
them
to
the
dining
hall
and
gave
them
a
place
at
the
head
of
those
invited
there
were
about
30
men
23
Samuel
said
to
the
cook
Bring
the
portion
that
I
gave
you
and
told
you
Set
it
aside
24
At
that
the
cook
lifted
up
the
leg
and
what
was
on
it
and
set
it
before
Saul
And
Samuel
said
What
has
been
reserved
has
been
set
before
you
Eat
because
they
have
reserved
it
for
you
for
this
occasion
For
I
told
them
I
invited
guests
So
Saul
ate
with
Samuel
on
that
day
25
Then
they
went
down
from
the
high
place
to
the
city
and
he
continued
to
speak
with
Saul
on
the
housetop
26
They
rose
early
and
at
daybreak
Samuel
called
to
Saul
on
the
housetop
saying
Get
ready
so
that
I
may
send
you
away
So
Saul
got
ready
and
both
he
and
Samuel
went
outside
27
While
they
were
descending
toward
the
outskirts
of
the
city
Samuel
said
to
Saul
Tell
the
attendant
to
go
on
ahead
of
us

so
he
went
on
ahead
But
you
stand
still
now
so
that
I
may
let
you
hear
the
word
of
God
1
Samuel
then
took
the
flask
of
oil
and
poured
it
out
on
Sauls
head
He
kissed
him
and
said
Has
not
Jehovah
anointed
you
as
a
leader
over
his
inheritance
2
When
you
leave
me
today
you
will
find
two
men
near
the
tomb
of
Rachel
in
the
territory
of
Benjamin
at
Zelzah
and
they
will
say
to
you
The
donkeys
that
you
went
to
look
for
have
been
found
but
now
your
father
has
forgotten
about
the
donkeys
and
is
worried
about
you
He
is
saying
What
should
I
do
about
my
son
3
Go
on
from
there
until
you
come
to
the
big
tree
of
Tabor
where
you
will
meet
three
men
going
up
to
the
true
God
at
Bethel
one
carrying
three
young
goats
one
carrying
three
loaves
of
bread
and
one
carrying
a
large
jar
of
wine
4
They
will
ask
about
your
welfare
and
give
you
two
loaves
and
you
must
accept
the
loaves
from
them
5
After
that
you
will
come
to
the
hill
of
the
true
God
where
there
is
a
garrison
of
the
Philistines
When
you
come
to
the
city
you
will
meet
a
group
of
prophets
coming
down
from
the
high
place
and
a
stringed
instrument
and
tambourine
and
flute
and
harp
will
be
played
ahead
of
them
while
they
are
prophesying
6
The
spirit
of
Jehovah
will
empower
you
and
you
will
prophesy
along
with
them
and
be
changed
into
a
different
person
7
When
these
signs
have
taken
place
do
whatever
your
hand
finds
possible
because
the
true
God
is
with
you
8
Then
go
down
ahead
of
me
to
Gilgal
and
I
will
go
down
to
you
there
to
offer
up
burnt
sacrifices
and
communion
sacrifices
You
should
wait
for
seven
days
until
I
come
to
you
Then
I
will
let
you
know
what
you
should
do
9
As
soon
as
Saul
turned
around
to
leave
Samuel
God
began
changing
his
heart
to
be
like
that
of
someone
else
and
all
these
signs
came
true
on
that
day
10
So
they
went
from
there
to
the
hill
and
a
group
of
prophets
met
him
At
once
the
spirit
of
God
empowered
him
and
he
began
to
prophesy
among
them
11
When
all
those
who
previously
knew
him
saw
him
prophesying
with
the
prophets
they
said
to
one
another
What
has
happened
to
the
son
of
Kish
Is
Saul
also
among
the
prophets
12
Then
a
man
from
there
said
But
who
is
their
father
So
it
became
a
saying
Is
Saul
also
among
the
prophets
13
When
he
finished
prophesying
he
came
to
the
high
place
14
The
brother
of
Sauls
father
later
said
to
him
and
to
his
attendant
Where
did
you
go
At
that
he
said
To
look
for
the
donkeys
but
we
saw
that
they
were
not
there
so
we
went
to
Samuel
15
Sauls
uncle
asked
Please
tell
me
what
did
Samuel
say
to
you
16
Saul
replied
to
his
uncle
He
told
us
that
the
donkeys
had
already
been
found
But
Saul
did
not
tell
him
what
Samuel
said
about
the
matter
of
the
kingship
17
Samuel
then
called
the
people
together
to
Jehovah
at
Mizpah
18
and
said
to
the
Israelites
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
It
was
I
who
brought
Israel
up
out
of
Egypt
and
who
rescued
you
from
the
hand
of
Egypt
and
from
the
hand
of
all
the
kingdoms
that
were
oppressing
you
19
But
today
you
have
rejected
your
God
who
was
your
Savior
out
of
all
your
evils
and
distresses
and
you
said
No
you
should
appoint
a
king
over
us
Now
take
your
stand
before
Jehovah
by
your
tribes
and
by
your
thousands
20
So
Samuel
had
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
draw
near
and
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
was
selected
21
Then
he
had
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
draw
near
by
its
families
and
the
family
of
the
Matrites
was
selected
Finally
Saul
the
son
of
Kish
was
selected
But
when
they
went
to
look
for
him
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
22
So
they
inquired
of
Jehovah
Has
the
man
come
here
yet
Jehovah
answered
There
he
is
hiding
himself
among
the
luggage
23
So
they
ran
and
brought
him
from
there
When
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
people
he
was
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
all
the
other
people
24
Samuel
said
to
all
the
people
Do
you
see
the
one
whom
Jehovah
has
chosen
that
there
is
none
like
him
among
all
the
people
And
all
the
people
began
to
shout
Long
live
the
king
25
Samuel
spoke
to
the
people
about
the
rightful
due
of
kings
and
wrote
it
in
a
book
and
deposited
it
before
Jehovah
Then
Samuel
sent
all
the
people
away
everyone
to
his
house
26
Saul
also
went
to
his
home
in
Gibeah
accompanied
by
the
warriors
whose
hearts
Jehovah
had
touched
27
But
some
worthless
men
said
How
will
this
one
save
us
So
they
despised
him
and
they
did
not
bring
any
gift
to
him
But
he
said
nothing
about
it
1
Then
Nahash
the
Ammonite
came
up
and
camped
against
Jabesh
in
Gilead
All
the
men
of
Jabesh
said
to
Nahash
Make
a
covenant
with
us
and
we
will
serve
you
2
Nahash
the
Ammonite
said
to
them
I
will
make
it
with
you
on
this
condition
that
all
your
right
eyes
be
bored
out
I
will
do
this
to
humiliate
all
Israel
3
The
elders
of
Jabesh
replied
to
him
Give
us
seven
days
time
so
that
we
can
send
messengers
into
all
the
territory
of
Israel
Then
if
there
is
no
one
to
rescue
us
we
will
surrender
to
you
4
In
time
the
messengers
came
to
Gibeah
of
Saul
and
spoke
these
words
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
and
all
the
people
wept
at
the
top
of
their
voice
5
But
Saul
was
coming
from
the
field
behind
the
herd
and
Saul
said
What
is
the
matter
with
the
people
Why
are
they
weeping
So
they
related
to
him
the
words
of
the
men
of
Jabesh
6
The
spirit
of
God
empowered
Saul
when
he
heard
these
words
and
he
burned
with
anger
7
So
he
took
a
pair
of
bulls
and
cut
them
into
pieces
and
he
sent
these
into
all
the
territory
of
Israel
by
the
hand
of
the
messengers
who
said
Whoever
does
not
follow
Saul
and
Samuel
should
expect
this
to
be
done
to
his
cattle
And
the
fear
of
Jehovah
fell
upon
the
people
so
that
they
came
out
with
one
accord
8
Then
he
counted
them
in
Bezek
and
there
were
300000
Israelites
and
30000
men
of
Judah
9
They
now
said
to
the
messengers
who
had
come
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
the
men
of
Jabesh
in
Gilead
Tomorrow
when
the
sun
gets
hot
you
will
be
saved
With
that
the
messengers
came
and
told
the
men
of
Jabesh
and
they
were
overjoyed
10
So
the
men
of
Jabesh
said
Tomorrow
we
will
surrender
to
you
and
you
may
do
to
us
whatever
seems
good
to
you
11
On
the
next
day
Saul
divided
the
people
into
three
bands
and
they
made
their
way
into
the
middle
of
the
camp
during
the
morning
watch
and
struck
down
the
Ammonites
until
the
day
grew
hot
Those
who
survived
were
scattered
so
that
no
two
of
them
were
left
together
12
Then
the
people
said
to
Samuel
Who
was
saying
Is
Saul
to
be
king
over
us
Hand
the
men
over
and
we
will
put
them
to
death
13
However
Saul
said
Not
a
man
should
be
put
to
death
on
this
day
for
today
Jehovah
has
rescued
Israel
14
Samuel
later
said
to
the
people
Come
and
let
us
go
to
Gilgal
to
reconfirm
the
kingship
15
So
all
the
people
went
to
Gilgal
and
in
Gilgal
they
made
Saul
king
before
Jehovah
Then
they
offered
communion
sacrifices
there
before
Jehovah
and
Saul
and
all
the
men
of
Israel
celebrated
with
great
joy
1
Finally
Samuel
said
to
all
Israel
Here
I
have
done
all
that
you
asked
of
me
and
I
appointed
a
king
to
reign
over
you
2
Now
here
is
the
king
who
is
leading
you
As
for
me
I
have
grown
old
and
gray
and
my
sons
are
here
with
you
and
I
have
led
you
from
my
youth
until
this
day
3
Here
I
am
Testify
against
me
before
Jehovah
and
before
his
anointed
one
Whose
bull
or
whose
donkey
have
I
taken
Or
whom
have
I
defrauded
or
crushed
From
whose
hand
have
I
accepted
a
bribe
to
make
me
look
the
other
way
If
I
have
I
will
restore
it
to
you
4
To
this
they
said
You
have
not
defrauded
us
or
crushed
us
or
accepted
anything
at
all
from
anyones
hand
5
So
he
said
to
them
Jehovah
is
a
witness
against
you
and
his
anointed
one
is
a
witness
this
day
that
you
have
found
nothing
to
accuse
me
of
To
this
they
said
He
is
a
witness
6
So
Samuel
said
to
the
people
Jehovah
who
used
Moses
and
Aaron
and
who
brought
your
forefathers
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
is
a
witness
7
And
now
take
your
positions
and
I
will
judge
you
before
Jehovah
in
view
of
all
the
righteous
acts
that
Jehovah
has
done
for
you
and
for
your
forefathers
8
As
soon
as
Jacob
had
come
into
Egypt
and
your
forefathers
began
calling
to
Jehovah
for
help
Jehovah
sent
Moses
and
Aaron
to
lead
your
forefathers
out
of
Egypt
and
to
cause
them
to
dwell
in
this
place
9
But
they
forgot
Jehovah
their
God
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
Sisera
the
chief
of
the
army
of
Hazor
and
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
and
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Moab
and
they
fought
against
them
10
And
they
called
to
Jehovah
for
help
and
said
We
have
sinned
for
we
have
left
Jehovah
to
serve
the
Baals
and
the
Ashtoreth
images
now
rescue
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
so
that
we
may
serve
you
11
Then
Jehovah
sent
Jerubbaal
and
Bedan
and
Jephthah
and
Samuel
and
rescued
you
from
the
hand
of
the
enemies
all
around
you
so
that
you
could
live
in
security
12
When
you
saw
that
Nahash
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
had
come
against
you
you
kept
saying
to
me
No
we
are
determined
to
have
a
king
over
us
even
though
Jehovah
your
God
is
your
King
13
Now
here
is
the
king
whom
you
have
chosen
the
one
you
asked
for
Look
Jehovah
has
appointed
a
king
over
you
14
If
you
fear
Jehovah
and
serve
him
and
obey
his
voice
and
you
do
not
rebel
against
the
order
of
Jehovah
and
both
you
and
the
king
who
reigns
over
you
follow
Jehovah
your
God
fine
15
But
if
you
do
not
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
and
you
rebel
against
the
order
of
Jehovah
the
hand
of
Jehovah
will
be
against
you
and
your
fathers
16
Now
take
your
positions
and
see
this
great
thing
that
Jehovah
is
doing
before
your
eyes
17
Is
it
not
the
wheat
harvest
today
I
will
call
on
Jehovah
to
make
it
thunder
and
rain
then
know
and
understand
what
an
evil
thing
you
have
done
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
in
asking
for
a
king
for
yourselves
18
At
that
Samuel
called
to
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
made
it
thunder
and
rain
on
that
day
so
that
all
the
people
were
greatly
in
fear
of
Jehovah
and
of
Samuel
19
And
all
the
people
said
to
Samuel
Pray
to
Jehovah
your
God
for
your
servants
as
we
do
not
want
to
die
for
we
have
added
to
all
our
sins
another
evil
by
asking
for
a
king
20
So
Samuel
said
to
the
people
Do
not
be
afraid
You
have
indeed
done
all
this
evil
Only
do
not
turn
away
from
following
Jehovah
and
serve
Jehovah
with
all
your
heart
21
Do
not
turn
away
to
follow
the
empty
things
which
are
of
no
benefit
and
cannot
rescue
because
they
are
empty
22
For
the
sake
of
his
great
name
Jehovah
will
not
abandon
his
people
for
Jehovah
has
taken
it
upon
himself
to
make
you
his
people
23
As
for
me
it
is
unthinkable
for
me
to
sin
against
Jehovah
by
ceasing
to
pray
in
your
behalf
and
I
will
continue
to
instruct
you
in
the
good
and
right
way
24
Only
fear
Jehovah
and
serve
him
faithfully
with
all
your
heart
for
see
what
great
things
he
has
done
for
you
25
But
if
you
flagrantly
do
what
is
bad
you
will
be
swept
away
both
you
and
your
king
1
Saul
was



years
old
when
he
became
king
and
for
two
years
he
reigned
over
Israel
2
Saul
chose
3000
men
out
of
Israel
2000
of
these
were
with
Saul
at
Michmash
and
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Bethel
and
1000
were
with
Jonathan
at
Gibeah
of
Benjamin
He
sent
the
rest
of
the
people
away
each
one
to
his
tent
3
Then
Jonathan
struck
down
the
garrison
of
the
Philistines
that
was
in
Geba
and
the
Philistines
heard
about
it
And
Saul
had
the
horn
blown
throughout
all
the
land
saying
Let
the
Hebrews
hear
4
All
Israel
heard
the
news
Saul
has
struck
down
a
garrison
of
the
Philistines
and
now
Israel
has
become
a
stench
among
the
Philistines
So
the
people
were
summoned
to
follow
Saul
at
Gilgal
5
The
Philistines
also
gathered
together
to
fight
against
Israel
with
30000
war
chariots
and
6000
horsemen
and
troops
as
numerous
as
the
grains
of
sand
on
the
seashore
and
they
went
up
and
camped
in
Michmash
to
the
east
of
Beth-aven
6
And
the
men
of
Israel
saw
that
they
were
in
trouble
because
they
were
hard-pressed
so
the
people
hid
in
the
caves
the
hollows
the
crags
the
cellars
and
the
cisterns
7
Some
of
the
Hebrews
even
crossed
the
Jordan
to
the
land
of
Gad
and
Gilead
But
Saul
was
still
in
Gilgal
and
all
the
people
following
him
were
trembling
8
He
continued
waiting
for
seven
days
until
the
designated
time
that
Samuel
had
set
but
Samuel
did
not
come
to
Gilgal
and
the
people
were
scattering
from
him
9
Finally
Saul
said
Bring
to
me
the
burnt
sacrifice
and
the
communion
sacrifices
And
he
offered
up
the
burnt
sacrifice
10
But
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
offering
up
the
burnt
sacrifice
Samuel
arrived
So
Saul
went
out
to
meet
him
and
bless
him
11
Then
Samuel
said
What
have
you
done
Saul
replied
I
saw
that
the
people
were
deserting
me
and
you
did
not
come
within
the
designated
time
and
the
Philistines
were
gathering
together
at
Michmash
12
So
I
said
to
myself
Now
the
Philistines
will
come
down
against
me
at
Gilgal
and
I
have
not
sought
the
favor
of
Jehovah
So
I
felt
obligated
to
offer
up
the
burnt
sacrifice
13
At
this
Samuel
said
to
Saul
You
have
acted
foolishly
You
have
not
obeyed
the
commandment
that
Jehovah
your
God
gave
you
If
you
had
Jehovah
would
have
made
your
kingdom
firm
over
Israel
forever
14
But
now
your
kingdom
will
not
last
Jehovah
will
find
a
man
agreeable
to
his
heart
and
Jehovah
will
commission
him
as
a
leader
over
his
people
because
you
did
not
obey
what
Jehovah
commanded
you
15
Then
Samuel
rose
and
went
his
way
up
from
Gilgal
to
Gibeah
of
Benjamin
and
Saul
took
the
count
of
the
people
those
still
with
him
were
about
600
men
16
Saul
his
son
Jonathan
and
the
people
still
with
them
were
dwelling
in
Geba
of
Benjamin
and
the
Philistines
had
encamped
at
Michmash
17
And
the
raiding
parties
would
go
out
from
the
camp
of
the
Philistines
in
three
bands
One
band
would
turn
toward
the
road
to
Ophrah
to
the
land
of
Shual
18
another
band
would
turn
toward
the
road
of
Beth-horon
and
the
third
band
would
turn
toward
the
road
leading
to
the
boundary
that
overlooks
the
valley
of
Zeboim
toward
the
wilderness
19
Now
there
was
not
a
metalworker
to
be
found
in
all
the
land
of
Israel
because
the
Philistines
had
said
So
that
the
Hebrews
may
not
make
a
sword
or
a
spear
20
And
all
the
Israelites
had
to
go
down
to
the
Philistines
to
get
their
plowshares
mattocks
axes
or
sickles
sharpened
21
The
price
for
sharpening
was
a
pim
for
the
plowshares
for
the
mattocks
for
the
three-toothed
instruments
for
the
axes
and
for
fixing
fast
the
oxgoad
22
And
on
the
day
of
battle
not
a
sword
or
a
spear
was
found
in
the
hand
of
any
of
the
people
who
were
with
Saul
and
Jonathan
only
Saul
and
his
son
Jonathan
had
weapons
23
Now
a
garrison
of
the
Philistines
had
gone
out
to
the
ravine
pass
of
Michmash
1
One
day
Jonathan
the
son
of
Saul
said
to
the
attendant
carrying
his
weapons
Come
and
let
us
cross
over
to
the
Philistine
outpost
on
the
other
side
But
he
did
not
tell
his
father
2
Saul
was
staying
on
the
outskirts
of
Gibeah
under
the
pomegranate
tree
in
Migron
and
there
were
about
600
men
with
him
3
And
Ahijah
the
son
of
Ahitub
the
brother
of
Ichabod
the
son
of
Phinehas
the
son
of
Eli
the
priest
of
Jehovah
in
Shiloh
was
carrying
the
ephod
And
the
people
did
not
know
that
Jonathan
had
gone
4
Now
between
the
passages
that
Jonathan
was
trying
to
cross
over
to
reach
the
outpost
of
the
Philistines
there
was
a
toothlike
crag
on
one
side
and
a
toothlike
crag
on
the
other
side
the
name
of
the
one
was
Bozez
and
the
name
of
the
other
was
Seneh
5
The
one
crag
was
a
pillar
on
the
north
facing
Michmash
and
the
other
was
on
the
south
facing
Geba
6
So
Jonathan
said
to
his
armor-bearer
Come
and
let
us
cross
over
to
the
outpost
of
these
uncircumcised
men
Perhaps
Jehovah
will
act
in
our
behalf
for
nothing
can
hinder
Jehovah
from
saving
by
many
or
by
few
7
At
this
his
armor-bearer
said
to
him
Do
whatever
your
heart
impels
you
to
do
Turn
wherever
you
wish
and
I
will
follow
you
wherever
your
heart
impels
you
8
Then
Jonathan
said
We
will
cross
over
to
those
men
and
reveal
our
presence
to
them
9
If
they
say
to
us
Stand
still
until
we
come
to
you
we
will
stand
where
we
are
and
not
go
up
to
them
10
But
if
they
say
Come
up
against
us
we
will
go
up
because
Jehovah
will
give
them
into
our
hand
This
will
be
our
sign
11
Then
both
of
them
revealed
their
presence
to
the
outpost
of
the
Philistines
The
Philistines
said
Look
The
Hebrews
are
coming
out
from
the
holes
where
they
have
been
hiding
12
So
the
men
of
the
outpost
said
to
Jonathan
and
his
armor-bearer
Come
up
to
us
and
we
will
teach
you
a
lesson
At
once
Jonathan
said
to
his
armor-bearer
Follow
me
for
Jehovah
will
give
them
into
the
hand
of
Israel
13
And
Jonathan
climbed
up
on
his
hands
and
feet
and
his
armor-bearer
was
behind
him
and
the
Philistines
began
to
fall
before
Jonathan
and
his
armor-bearer
was
putting
them
to
death
behind
him
14
In
the
first
attack
that
Jonathan
and
his
armor-bearer
made
they
struck
down
about
20
men
within
about
half
the
plowing
line
in
an
acre
of
field
15
Then
terror
spread
in
the
field
camp
and
among
all
the
people
of
the
outpost
and
even
the
raiding
parties
were
terrified
The
earth
began
quaking
and
a
terror
from
God
ensued
16
Sauls
watchmen
in
Gibeah
of
Benjamin
saw
that
the
turmoil
was
spreading
in
every
direction
17
Saul
said
to
the
people
with
him
Take
a
count
please
and
see
who
has
left
us
When
they
took
the
count
they
saw
that
Jonathan
and
his
armor-bearer
were
not
there
18
Saul
now
said
to
Ahijah
Bring
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
near
For
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
was
with
the
Israelites
at
that
time
19
And
while
Saul
was
speaking
to
the
priest
the
turmoil
in
the
camp
of
the
Philistines
was
growing
greater
and
greater
Then
Saul
said
to
the
priest
Stop
what
you
are
doing
20
So
Saul
and
all
the
people
with
him
assembled
and
went
into
the
battle
where
they
found
that
the
Philistines
had
turned
their
swords
against
one
another
and
the
confusion
was
very
great
21
Also
the
Hebrews
who
had
previously
sided
with
the
Philistines
and
who
had
come
up
with
them
into
the
camp
were
going
over
to
Israel
under
Saul
and
Jonathan
22
All
the
men
of
Israel
who
had
hidden
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
heard
that
the
Philistines
had
fled
and
they
too
joined
in
pursuing
them
in
the
battle
23
So
Jehovah
saved
Israel
on
that
day
and
the
battle
extended
as
far
as
Beth-aven
24
But
the
men
of
Israel
were
hard-pressed
on
that
day
for
Saul
had
put
the
people
under
this
oath
Cursed
is
the
man
who
eats
any
food
before
the
evening
and
until
I
have
taken
vengeance
on
my
enemies
So
none
of
the
people
ate
any
food
25
And
all
the
people
came
into
the
forest
and
there
was
honey
on
the
ground
26
When
the
people
came
into
the
forest
they
saw
the
honey
dripping
but
no
one
would
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
because
they
feared
the
oath
27
But
Jonathan
had
not
heard
his
father
put
the
people
under
an
oath
so
he
stretched
out
the
tip
of
the
staff
that
was
in
his
hand
and
dipped
it
into
the
honeycomb
When
he
drew
his
hand
back
to
his
mouth
his
eyes
brightened
28
At
this
one
of
the
people
said
Your
father
put
the
people
under
a
strict
oath
saying
Cursed
is
the
man
who
eats
food
today
That
is
why
the
people
are
so
tired
29
However
Jonathan
said
My
father
has
brought
great
trouble
on
the
land
Look
at
how
my
eyes
brightened
because
I
tasted
this
little
bit
of
honey
30
How
much
better
if
the
people
had
eaten
freely
today
from
the
spoil
of
their
enemies
that
they
found
For
then
the
slaughter
of
the
Philistines
would
have
been
even
greater
31
On
that
day
they
kept
striking
down
the
Philistines
from
Michmash
to
Aijalon
and
the
people
became
very
tired
32
So
the
people
began
rushing
greedily
at
the
spoil
and
they
took
sheep
and
cattle
and
calves
and
slaughtered
them
on
the
ground
and
they
ate
the
meat
along
with
the
blood
33
So
it
was
reported
to
Saul
Look
The
people
are
sinning
against
Jehovah
by
eating
meat
with
the
blood
At
this
he
said
You
have
acted
faithlessly
Roll
a
large
stone
to
me
immediately
34
Saul
then
said
Spread
out
among
the
people
and
say
to
them
Each
of
you
must
bring
his
bull
and
his
sheep
and
slaughter
them
here
and
then
eat
them
Do
not
sin
against
Jehovah
by
eating
meat
with
the
blood
So
each
of
them
brought
his
bull
with
him
that
night
and
slaughtered
it
there
35
And
Saul
built
an
altar
to
Jehovah
This
was
the
first
altar
he
built
to
Jehovah
36
Saul
later
said
Let
us
go
down
after
the
Philistines
by
night
and
plunder
them
until
the
morning
light
We
will
not
leave
a
single
survivor
To
this
they
said
Do
whatever
seems
good
in
your
eyes
Then
the
priest
said
Let
us
approach
the
true
God
here
37
And
Saul
inquired
of
God
Should
I
go
down
after
the
Philistines
Will
you
give
them
into
the
hand
of
Israel
But
God
did
not
answer
him
on
that
day
38
So
Saul
said
Come
here
all
you
chiefs
of
the
people
and
find
out
what
sin
has
been
committed
today
39
For
as
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
who
rescued
Israel
even
if
it
turns
out
to
be
Jonathan
my
son
he
must
die
But
none
of
the
people
would
answer
him
40
Then
he
said
to
all
Israel
You
will
be
on
one
side
and
my
son
Jonathan
and
I
will
be
on
the
other
side
At
this
the
people
said
to
Saul
Do
whatever
seems
good
in
your
eyes
41
Saul
then
said
to
Jehovah
O
God
of
Israel
answer
with
the
Thummim
Then
Jonathan
and
Saul
were
selected
and
the
people
went
free
42
Saul
now
said
Cast
lots
to
decide
between
me
and
my
son
Jonathan
And
Jonathan
was
selected
43
Then
Saul
said
to
Jonathan
Tell
me
what
have
you
done
So
Jonathan
told
him
I
merely
tasted
a
little
honey
on
the
tip
of
the
staff
in
my
hand
Here
I
am
I
am
ready
to
die
44
At
this
Saul
said
Thus
may
God
do
and
may
he
add
to
it
if
you
do
not
die
Jonathan
45
But
the
people
said
to
Saul
Should
Jonathan
die—the
one
who
brought
this
great
victory
to
Israel
It
is
unthinkable
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
not
even
a
single
hair
of
his
head
should
fall
to
the
ground
for
it
was
with
God
that
he
acted
this
day
With
that
the
people
rescued
Jonathan
and
he
did
not
die
46
So
Saul
stopped
pursuing
the
Philistines
and
the
Philistines
went
to
their
own
territory
47
Saul
secured
the
kingship
over
Israel
and
fought
against
all
his
enemies
on
every
side
against
the
Moabites
the
Ammonites
the
Edomites
the
kings
of
Zobah
and
the
Philistines
and
wherever
he
went
he
defeated
them
48
And
he
fought
bravely
and
conquered
the
Amalekites
and
rescued
Israel
from
the
hand
of
their
plunderers
49
The
sons
of
Saul
were
Jonathan
Ishvi
and
Malchi-shua
And
he
had
two
daughters
the
name
of
the
older
one
was
Merab
and
the
name
of
the
younger
one
Michal
50
The
name
of
Sauls
wife
was
Ahinoam
the
daughter
of
Ahimaaz
The
name
of
the
chief
of
his
army
was
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
the
uncle
of
Saul
51
Kish
was
the
father
of
Saul
and
Ner
the
father
of
Abner
was
the
son
of
Abiel
52
There
was
fierce
warfare
with
the
Philistines
all
the
days
of
Saul
When
Saul
saw
any
strong
or
courageous
man
he
would
recruit
him
into
his
service
1
Then
Samuel
said
to
Saul
Jehovah
sent
me
to
anoint
you
as
king
over
his
people
Israel
now
listen
to
what
Jehovah
has
to
say
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
I
will
call
to
account
the
Amalekites
for
what
they
did
to
Israel
when
they
opposed
them
along
their
way
coming
up
from
Egypt
3
Now
go
and
strike
down
the
Amalekites
and
devote
them
to
destruction
along
with
all
that
they
have
You
must
not
spare
them
you
are
to
put
them
to
death
man
as
well
as
woman
child
as
well
as
infant
bull
as
well
as
sheep
camel
as
well
as
donkey
4
Saul
summoned
the
people
and
counted
them
in
Telaim
There
were
200000
foot
soldiers
and
10000
men
of
Judah
5
Saul
advanced
as
far
as
the
city
of
Amalek
and
set
an
ambush
by
the
valley
6
Saul
then
said
to
the
Kenites
Go
depart
from
among
the
Amalekites
so
that
I
do
not
sweep
you
away
with
them
For
you
showed
loyal
love
to
all
the
people
of
Israel
at
the
time
they
came
up
out
of
Egypt
So
the
Kenites
departed
from
the
midst
of
Amalek
7
After
that
Saul
struck
down
the
Amalekites
from
Havilah
as
far
as
Shur
which
is
next
to
Egypt
8
He
caught
Agag
the
king
of
Amalek
alive
but
all
the
other
people
he
devoted
to
destruction
with
the
sword
9
However
Saul
and
the
people
spared
Agag
and
the
best
of
the
flock
the
herd
the
fattened
animals
the
rams
and
all
that
was
good
They
did
not
want
to
devote
them
to
destruction
But
all
the
goods
that
were
worthless
and
unwanted
these
they
devoted
to
destruction
10
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Samuel
11
I
regret
that
I
have
made
Saul
king
for
he
has
turned
away
from
following
me
and
he
has
not
carried
out
my
words
Samuel
became
very
upset
and
he
kept
crying
out
to
Jehovah
all
night
long
12
When
Samuel
got
up
early
in
the
morning
to
meet
Saul
Samuel
was
told
Saul
went
to
Carmel
and
there
he
erected
a
monument
for
himself
Then
he
turned
around
and
went
down
to
Gilgal
13
When
Samuel
finally
came
to
him
Saul
said
to
him
May
Jehovah
bless
you
I
have
carried
out
the
word
of
Jehovah
14
But
Samuel
said
Then
what
is
this
sound
of
the
flock
in
my
ears
and
the
sound
of
the
cattle
that
I
hear
15
To
this
Saul
said
They
were
brought
from
the
Amalekites
because
the
people
spared
the
best
of
the
flock
and
the
herd
for
sacrificing
them
to
Jehovah
your
God
but
what
was
left
we
devoted
to
destruction
16
At
this
Samuel
said
to
Saul
Stop
Let
me
tell
you
what
Jehovah
said
to
me
last
night
So
he
said
to
him
Speak
17
Samuel
continued
Were
you
not
insignificant
in
your
own
eyes
when
you
were
made
head
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
and
when
Jehovah
anointed
you
as
king
over
Israel
18
Jehovah
later
sent
you
on
a
mission
and
said
Go
and
devote
the
sinful
Amalekites
to
destruction
Fight
against
them
until
you
have
exterminated
them
19
So
why
did
you
not
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
Instead
you
rushed
greedily
toward
the
spoil
and
did
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
20
However
Saul
said
to
Samuel
But
I
have
obeyed
the
voice
of
Jehovah
I
went
on
the
mission
to
which
Jehovah
sent
me
and
I
brought
back
Agag
the
king
of
Amalek
and
I
devoted
the
Amalekites
to
destruction
21
But
the
people
took
sheep
and
cattle
from
the
spoil
the
best
of
what
was
devoted
to
destruction
to
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
your
God
at
Gilgal
22
Samuel
then
said
Does
Jehovah
take
as
much
pleasure
in
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
as
in
obeying
the
voice
of
Jehovah
Look
To
obey
is
better
than
a
sacrifice
and
to
pay
attention
than
the
fat
of
rams
23
for
rebelliousness
is
the
same
as
the
sin
of
divination
and
pushing
ahead
presumptuously
the
same
as
using
magical
power
and
idolatry
Because
you
have
rejected
the
word
of
Jehovah
he
has
rejected
you
from
being
king
24
Then
Saul
said
to
Samuel
I
have
sinned
for
I
have
overstepped
the
order
of
Jehovah
and
your
words
because
I
feared
the
people
and
listened
to
what
they
said
25
And
now
please
pardon
my
sin
and
return
with
me
so
that
I
may
bow
down
to
Jehovah
26
But
Samuel
said
to
Saul
I
will
not
return
with
you
for
you
have
rejected
the
word
of
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
has
rejected
you
from
continuing
as
king
over
Israel
27
As
Samuel
was
turning
to
go
Saul
grabbed
hold
of
the
hem
of
his
sleeveless
coat
but
it
ripped
away
28
At
this
Samuel
said
to
him
Jehovah
has
ripped
away
the
royal
rule
of
Israel
from
you
today
and
he
will
give
it
to
one
of
your
fellow
men
who
is
better
than
you
29
Moreover
the
Excellency
of
Israel
will
not
prove
false
or
change
his
mind
for
He
is
not
a
mere
man
that
he
should
change
his
mind
30
At
this
he
said
I
have
sinned
But
honor
me
please
in
front
of
the
elders
of
my
people
and
in
front
of
Israel
Return
with
me
and
I
will
bow
down
to
Jehovah
your
God
31
So
Samuel
returned
behind
Saul
and
Saul
bowed
down
to
Jehovah
32
And
Samuel
said
Bring
Agag
the
king
of
Amalek
near
to
me
Then
Agag
went
to
him
reluctantly
for
Agag
had
been
saying
to
himself
Surely
the
threat
of
death
is
past
33
However
Samuel
said
Just
as
your
sword
has
bereaved
women
of
children
so
your
mother
will
be
most
bereaved
among
women
With
that
Samuel
hacked
Agag
to
pieces
before
Jehovah
at
Gilgal
34
Samuel
now
went
to
Ramah
and
Saul
went
up
to
his
own
house
at
Gibeah
of
Saul
35
Samuel
did
not
see
Saul
again
until
the
day
of
his
death
for
Samuel
went
into
mourning
for
Saul
And
Jehovah
regretted
that
he
had
made
Saul
king
over
Israel
1
Jehovah
eventually
said
to
Samuel
How
long
will
you
mourn
for
Saul
now
that
I
have
rejected
him
from
ruling
as
king
over
Israel
Fill
your
horn
with
oil
and
go
I
will
send
you
to
Jesse
the
Bethlehemite
because
I
have
selected
from
among
his
sons
a
king
for
myself
2
But
Samuel
said
How
can
I
go
When
Saul
hears
about
it
he
will
kill
me
Jehovah
replied
Take
a
young
cow
with
you
and
say
I
have
come
to
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
3
Invite
Jesse
to
the
sacrifice
then
I
will
make
known
to
you
what
to
do
You
must
anoint
for
me
the
one
whom
I
designate
to
you
4
Samuel
did
what
Jehovah
said
When
he
came
to
Bethlehem
the
elders
of
the
city
were
trembling
at
meeting
him
and
they
said
Does
your
coming
mean
peace
5
To
this
he
said
It
means
peace
I
have
come
to
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
Sanctify
yourselves
and
come
with
me
to
the
sacrifice
Then
he
sanctified
Jesse
and
his
sons
after
which
he
summoned
them
to
the
sacrifice
6
As
they
came
in
and
he
saw
Eliab
he
said
Surely
here
before
Jehovah
stands
his
anointed
one
7
But
Jehovah
said
to
Samuel
Do
not
pay
attention
to
his
appearance
and
how
tall
he
is
for
I
have
rejected
him
For
the
way
man
sees
is
not
the
way
God
sees
because
mere
man
sees
what
appears
to
the
eyes
but
Jehovah
sees
into
the
heart
8
Then
Jesse
called
Abinadab
and
had
him
pass
before
Samuel
but
he
said
Jehovah
has
not
chosen
this
one
either
9
Next
Jesse
presented
Shammah
but
he
said
Jehovah
has
not
chosen
this
one
either
10
So
Jesse
had
seven
of
his
sons
pass
before
Samuel
but
Samuel
said
to
Jesse
Jehovah
has
not
chosen
any
of
these
11
Finally
Samuel
said
to
Jesse
Are
these
all
of
your
boys
To
this
he
said
The
youngest
has
been
left
out
until
now
he
is
pasturing
the
sheep
Then
Samuel
said
to
Jesse
Send
for
him
because
we
will
not
sit
down
for
the
meal
until
he
comes
here
12
So
he
sent
for
him
and
brought
him
in
Now
he
was
ruddy
with
beautiful
eyes
and
handsome
in
appearance
Then
Jehovah
said
Get
up
anoint
him
for
this
is
the
one
13
So
Samuel
took
the
horn
of
oil
and
anointed
him
in
the
presence
of
his
brothers
And
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
began
to
empower
David
from
that
day
forward
Samuel
later
rose
and
went
his
way
to
Ramah
14
Now
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
had
departed
from
Saul
and
a
bad
spirit
from
Jehovah
terrorized
him
15
The
servants
of
Saul
said
to
him
You
see
that
a
bad
spirit
from
God
is
terrorizing
you
16
Let
our
lord
please
command
your
servants
before
you
to
look
for
a
man
who
is
skilled
at
playing
the
harp
Whenever
a
bad
spirit
from
God
comes
upon
you
he
will
play
it
and
you
will
feel
better
17
So
Saul
said
to
his
servants
Find
me
please
a
man
who
plays
well
and
bring
him
to
me
18
One
of
the
attendants
said
Look
I
have
seen
how
a
son
of
Jesse
the
Bethlehemite
plays
skillfully
and
he
is
a
courageous
mighty
warrior
He
can
speak
well
and
he
is
handsome
and
Jehovah
is
with
him
19
Saul
then
sent
messengers
to
Jesse
and
said
Send
to
me
your
son
David
who
is
with
the
flock
20
So
Jesse
loaded
a
donkey
with
bread
a
skin
bottle
of
wine
and
a
young
goat
and
sent
them
to
Saul
with
his
son
David
21
Thus
David
came
to
Saul
and
began
serving
him
Saul
grew
to
love
him
very
much
and
he
became
his
armor-bearer
22
Saul
sent
a
message
to
Jesse
Please
let
David
remain
in
my
service
for
he
has
found
favor
in
my
eyes
23
Whenever
a
bad
spirit
from
God
came
upon
Saul
David
took
the
harp
and
played
it
and
Saul
found
relief
and
felt
better
and
the
bad
spirit
would
depart
from
him
1
And
the
Philistines
assembled
their
armies
for
war
They
assembled
at
Socoh
which
belongs
to
Judah
and
they
camped
between
Socoh
and
Azekah
in
Ephes-dammim
2
Saul
and
the
men
of
Israel
assembled
and
camped
in
the
Valley
of
Elah
and
they
drew
up
in
battle
formation
to
meet
the
Philistines
3
The
Philistines
occupied
the
mountain
on
one
side
and
the
Israelites
occupied
the
mountain
on
the
other
side
with
the
valley
between
them
4
Then
a
champion
came
out
from
the
camps
of
the
Philistines
his
name
was
Goliath
from
Gath
and
his
height
was
six
cubits
and
a
span
5
He
had
a
helmet
of
copper
on
his
head
and
he
was
wearing
a
coat
of
mail
of
overlapping
scales
The
weight
of
the
copper
coat
of
mail
was
5000
shekels
6
He
had
shin
guards
of
copper
on
his
legs
and
a
javelin
of
copper
slung
between
his
shoulders
7
The
wooden
shaft
of
his
spear
was
like
the
beam
of
loom
workers
and
the
iron
blade
of
his
spear
weighed
600
shekels
and
his
shield-bearer
was
marching
ahead
of
him
8
Then
he
stood
and
called
out
to
the
battle
line
of
Israel
and
said
to
them
Why
have
you
come
out
to
draw
up
in
battle
formation
Am
I
not
the
Philistine
and
are
you
not
the
servants
of
Saul
Choose
a
man
for
yourselves
and
let
him
come
down
to
me
9
If
he
is
able
to
fight
with
me
and
strike
me
down
we
will
then
become
your
servants
But
if
I
prevail
against
him
and
strike
him
down
you
will
become
our
servants
and
serve
us
10
The
Philistine
then
said
I
do
taunt
the
battle
line
of
Israel
this
day
Give
me
a
man
and
let
us
fight
it
out
11
When
Saul
and
all
Israel
heard
these
words
of
the
Philistine
they
became
terrified
and
greatly
afraid
12
Now
David
was
the
son
of
the
Ephrathite
from
Bethlehem
of
Judah
named
Jesse
who
had
eight
sons
and
who
in
the
days
of
Saul
was
already
an
old
man
13
The
three
oldest
sons
of
Jesse
had
followed
Saul
to
the
war
The
names
of
his
three
sons
who
went
to
war
were
Eliab
the
firstborn
his
second
son
Abinadab
and
the
third
Shammah
14
David
was
the
youngest
and
the
three
oldest
followed
Saul
15
David
was
going
back
and
forth
from
Saul
to
tend
the
sheep
of
his
father
at
Bethlehem
16
Meanwhile
the
Philistine
would
come
forward
and
take
his
position
each
morning
and
each
evening
for
40
days
17
Then
Jesse
said
to
his
son
David
Take
please
this
ephah
of
roasted
grain
and
these
ten
loaves
of
bread
and
carry
them
quickly
to
your
brothers
in
the
camp
18
And
take
these
ten
portions
of
cheese
to
the
chief
of
the
thousand
also
you
should
check
on
the
welfare
of
your
brothers
and
bring
back
some
token
from
them
19
They
were
with
Saul
and
all
the
other
men
of
Israel
in
the
Valley
of
Elah
fighting
against
the
Philistines
20
So
David
got
up
early
in
the
morning
and
left
someone
in
charge
of
the
sheep
then
he
packed
up
and
went
just
as
Jesse
had
commanded
him
When
he
came
to
the
camp
enclosure
the
army
was
going
out
to
the
battle
line
shouting
a
battle
cry
21
Israel
and
the
Philistines
drew
up
so
that
one
battle
line
faced
the
other
battle
line
22
David
immediately
left
his
baggage
in
the
care
of
the
baggage
keeper
and
ran
to
the
battle
line
When
he
arrived
he
began
asking
about
the
welfare
of
his
brothers
23
While
he
was
speaking
with
them
there
came
the
champion
named
Goliath
the
Philistine
from
Gath
He
came
out
from
the
battle
line
of
the
Philistines
and
he
spoke
the
same
words
as
before
and
David
heard
him
24
When
all
the
men
of
Israel
saw
the
man
they
fled
from
him
terrified
25
The
men
of
Israel
were
saying
Have
you
seen
this
man
who
is
coming
out
He
comes
to
taunt
Israel
The
king
will
give
great
riches
to
the
man
who
strikes
him
down
he
will
give
him
his
own
daughter
and
he
will
give
the
house
of
his
father
exemption
in
Israel
26
David
began
to
say
to
the
men
who
were
standing
near
him
What
will
be
done
for
the
man
who
strikes
down
that
Philistine
over
there
and
takes
away
reproach
from
Israel
For
who
is
this
uncircumcised
Philistine
that
he
should
taunt
the
battle
line
of
the
living
God
27
Then
the
people
told
him
the
same
thing
as
before
This
is
what
will
be
done
for
the
man
who
strikes
him
down
28
When
his
oldest
brother
Eliab
heard
him
speak
to
the
men
he
became
angry
with
David
and
said
Why
have
you
come
down
And
with
whom
did
you
leave
those
few
sheep
in
the
wilderness
I
well
know
your
presumptuousness
and
the
bad
intentions
of
your
heart
you
came
down
just
to
see
the
battle
29
To
this
David
said
What
have
I
done
now
I
was
only
asking
a
question
30
So
he
turned
from
him
toward
someone
else
and
asked
the
same
thing
as
before
and
the
people
gave
him
the
same
reply
as
before
31
The
words
that
David
had
spoken
were
overheard
and
reported
to
Saul
So
he
sent
for
him
32
David
said
to
Saul
Let
no
one
lose
heart
because
of
him
Your
servant
will
go
and
fight
with
this
Philistine
33
But
Saul
said
to
David
You
are
not
able
to
go
fight
against
this
Philistine
for
you
are
but
a
boy
and
he
has
been
a
soldier
from
his
youth
34
David
then
said
to
Saul
Your
servant
became
a
shepherd
of
his
fathers
flock
and
a
lion
came
also
a
bear
and
each
carried
off
a
sheep
from
the
flock
35
I
went
out
after
it
and
struck
it
down
and
rescued
it
from
its
mouth
When
it
rose
up
against
me
I
grabbed
it
by
its
fur
and
struck
it
down
and
put
it
to
death
36
Your
servant
struck
down
both
the
lion
and
the
bear
and
this
uncircumcised
Philistine
will
become
like
one
of
them
for
he
has
taunted
the
battle
lines
of
the
living
God
37
Then
David
added
Jehovah
who
rescued
me
from
the
claws
of
the
lion
and
the
bear
he
is
the
one
who
will
rescue
me
from
the
hand
of
this
Philistine
At
this
Saul
said
to
David
Go
and
may
Jehovah
be
with
you
38
Saul
now
clothed
David
with
his
garments
He
put
a
copper
helmet
on
his
head
after
which
he
clothed
him
with
a
coat
of
mail
39
Then
David
strapped
on
his
sword
over
his
garments
and
tried
to
go
but
could
not
for
he
was
not
used
to
them
David
said
to
Saul
I
am
unable
to
go
in
these
things
for
I
am
not
used
to
them
So
David
took
them
off
40
He
then
took
his
staff
in
his
hand
and
chose
five
smooth
stones
from
the
streambed
and
placed
them
in
the
pouch
of
his
shepherds
bag
and
his
sling
was
in
his
hand
And
he
began
approaching
the
Philistine
41
The
Philistine
came
closer
and
closer
to
David
and
his
shield-bearer
was
ahead
of
him
42
When
the
Philistine
looked
and
saw
David
he
sneered
at
him
in
contempt
because
he
was
just
a
ruddy
and
handsome
boy
43
So
the
Philistine
said
to
David
Am
I
a
dog
so
that
you
are
coming
against
me
with
sticks
With
that
the
Philistine
cursed
David
by
his
gods
44
The
Philistine
said
to
David
Just
come
to
me
and
I
will
give
your
flesh
to
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
45
David
replied
to
the
Philistine
You
are
coming
against
me
with
sword
and
spear
and
javelin
but
I
am
coming
against
you
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
the
battle
line
of
Israel
whom
you
have
taunted
46
This
very
day
Jehovah
will
surrender
you
into
my
hand
and
I
will
strike
you
down
and
cut
off
your
head
and
on
this
day
I
will
give
the
corpses
of
the
camp
of
the
Philistines
to
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
to
the
wild
beasts
of
the
earth
and
people
of
all
the
earth
will
know
that
there
is
a
God
in
Israel
47
And
all
those
gathered
here
will
know
that
it
is
not
with
the
sword
or
the
spear
that
Jehovah
saves
for
the
battle
belongs
to
Jehovah
and
he
will
give
all
of
you
into
our
hand
48
Then
the
Philistine
rose
and
drew
steadily
closer
to
meet
David
but
David
ran
quickly
toward
the
battle
line
to
meet
the
Philistine
49
David
thrust
his
hand
into
his
bag
and
took
a
stone
from
there
and
slung
it
He
struck
the
Philistine
in
the
forehead
and
the
stone
sank
into
his
forehead
and
he
fell
facedown
on
the
ground
50
So
David
prevailed
over
the
Philistine
with
a
sling
and
a
stone
he
struck
down
the
Philistine
and
put
him
to
death
though
there
was
no
sword
in
Davids
hand
51
David
continued
running
and
stood
over
him
Then
he
took
hold
of
the
Philistines
sword
and
pulled
it
out
of
its
sheath
and
made
sure
that
he
was
dead
by
cutting
off
his
head
with
it
When
the
Philistines
saw
that
their
mighty
one
had
died
they
fled
52
At
that
the
men
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
rose
and
broke
into
shouting
and
pursued
the
Philistines
all
the
way
from
the
valley
to
the
gates
of
Ekron
and
the
slain
of
the
Philistines
lay
fallen
along
the
road
from
Shaaraim
as
far
as
Gath
and
Ekron
53
After
the
Israelites
returned
from
hotly
pursuing
the
Philistines
they
pillaged
their
camps
54
Then
David
took
the
head
of
the
Philistine
and
brought
it
to
Jerusalem
but
he
put
the
Philistines
weapons
in
his
own
tent
55
At
the
moment
that
Saul
saw
David
go
out
to
meet
the
Philistine
he
said
to
Abner
the
chief
of
the
army
Whose
son
is
this
boy
Abner
Abner
replied
As
surely
as
you
live
O
king
I
do
not
know
56
The
king
said
Find
out
whose
son
the
young
man
is
57
So
as
soon
as
David
returned
from
striking
down
the
Philistine
Abner
took
him
and
brought
him
before
Saul
with
the
head
of
the
Philistine
in
his
hand
58
Saul
now
said
to
him
Whose
son
are
you
boy
to
which
David
said
The
son
of
your
servant
Jesse
the
Bethlehemite
1
As
soon
as
David
had
finished
speaking
to
Saul
Jonathan
and
David
became
bound
together
in
close
friendship
and
Jonathan
began
to
love
him
as
himself
2
From
that
day
Saul
kept
David
with
him
and
he
did
not
allow
him
to
return
to
his
fathers
house
3
And
Jonathan
and
David
made
a
covenant
because
he
loved
him
as
himself
4
Jonathan
took
off
the
sleeveless
coat
that
he
wore
and
gave
it
to
David
along
with
his
gear
his
sword
his
bow
and
his
belt
5
David
began
going
out
and
was
successful
wherever
Saul
would
send
him
So
Saul
put
him
in
charge
of
the
fighting
men
and
this
pleased
all
the
people
and
the
servants
of
Saul
6
When
David
and
the
others
would
return
from
striking
down
the
Philistines
the
women
would
come
out
from
all
the
cities
of
Israel
with
song
and
dances
to
meet
King
Saul
with
tambourines
with
rejoicing
and
with
lutes
7
The
women
who
were
celebrating
would
sing
Saul
has
struck
down
his
thousands
And
David
his
tens
of
thousands
8
Saul
became
very
angry
and
this
song
displeased
him
for
he
said
They
have
credited
David
with
tens
of
thousands
but
to
me
they
have
credited
thousands
The
only
thing
left
to
give
him
is
the
kingship
9
From
that
day
on
Saul
was
always
looking
at
David
suspiciously
10
The
next
day
a
bad
spirit
from
God
gripped
Saul
and
he
started
to
act
strangely
inside
the
house
while
David
was
playing
music
on
the
harp
as
on
other
occasions
Saul
had
a
spear
in
his
hand
11
and
he
hurled
the
spear
saying
to
himself
I
will
pin
David
to
the
wall
But
David
escaped
from
him
twice
12
Then
Saul
was
afraid
of
David
because
Jehovah
was
with
him
but
had
departed
from
Saul
13
So
Saul
removed
him
from
his
presence
and
appointed
him
as
chief
of
a
thousand
and
David
would
lead
the
army
into
battle
14
David
continued
to
have
success
in
all
he
did
and
Jehovah
was
with
him
15
And
when
Saul
saw
that
he
was
very
successful
he
became
afraid
of
him
16
But
all
Israel
and
Judah
loved
David
because
he
would
lead
them
in
their
campaigns
17
Saul
later
said
to
David
Here
is
my
oldest
daughter
Merab
I
will
give
her
to
you
as
a
wife
However
you
should
continue
to
display
your
courage
for
me
and
fight
the
wars
of
Jehovah
For
Saul
said
to
himself
Do
not
let
my
hand
come
against
him
Let
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
strike
him
18
At
this
David
said
to
Saul
Who
am
I
and
who
are
my
relatives
my
fathers
family
in
Israel
for
me
to
become
son-in-law
to
the
king
19
However
when
the
time
came
to
give
Sauls
daughter
Merab
to
David
she
had
already
been
given
to
be
the
wife
of
Adriel
the
Meholathite
20
Now
Sauls
daughter
Michal
was
in
love
with
David
and
it
was
reported
to
Saul
and
this
pleased
him
21
So
Saul
said
I
will
give
her
to
him
to
serve
as
a
snare
to
him
so
that
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
may
come
upon
him
Saul
then
said
to
David
a
second
time
You
will
form
a
marriage
alliance
with
me
today
22
Further
Saul
ordered
his
servants
Speak
to
David
secretly
and
say
Look
The
king
is
pleased
with
you
and
all
his
servants
are
fond
of
you
So
now
form
a
marriage
alliance
with
the
king
23
When
Sauls
servants
told
David
these
things
David
said
Is
it
a
trivial
matter
to
you
to
form
a
marriage
alliance
with
the
king
when
I
am
a
man
poor
and
lightly
esteemed
24
Then
Sauls
servants
reported
to
him
These
are
the
words
that
David
spoke
25
At
that
Saul
said
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
David
The
king
does
not
want
any
bride
price
except
100
foreskins
of
the
Philistines
to
take
revenge
on
the
enemies
of
the
king
For
Saul
was
scheming
to
have
David
fall
by
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
26
So
his
servants
reported
these
words
to
David
and
it
was
pleasing
to
David
to
form
a
marriage
alliance
with
the
king
Before
the
allotted
time
27
David
went
with
his
men
and
struck
down
200
Philistine
men
and
David
brought
the
full
number
of
their
foreskins
to
the
king
to
form
a
marriage
alliance
with
the
king
Therefore
Saul
gave
him
his
daughter
Michal
as
a
wife
28
Saul
realized
that
Jehovah
was
with
David
and
that
his
daughter
Michal
loved
him
29
This
made
Saul
even
more
afraid
of
David
and
Saul
became
an
enemy
of
David
for
the
rest
of
his
life
30
The
princes
of
the
Philistines
would
go
out
to
battle
but
as
often
as
they
went
out
David
was
more
successful
than
all
the
servants
of
Saul
and
his
name
was
highly
esteemed
1
Saul
later
spoke
to
Jonathan
his
son
and
to
all
his
servants
about
putting
David
to
death
2
Since
Sauls
son
Jonathan
was
very
fond
of
David
Jonathan
told
David
My
father
Saul
wants
to
have
you
put
to
death
Please
be
on
your
guard
in
the
morning
and
go
to
a
secret
place
and
remain
hidden
3
I
will
go
out
and
stand
next
to
my
father
in
the
field
where
you
will
be
I
will
talk
about
you
to
my
father
and
if
I
learn
anything
I
will
be
sure
to
tell
you
4
So
Jonathan
spoke
well
of
David
to
his
father
Saul
He
said
to
him
The
king
should
not
sin
against
his
servant
David
for
he
has
not
sinned
against
you
and
what
he
has
done
for
you
has
benefited
you
5
He
risked
his
life
to
strike
down
the
Philistine
so
that
Jehovah
brought
about
a
great
victory
for
all
Israel
You
saw
it
and
you
were
overjoyed
So
why
should
you
sin
against
innocent
blood
in
having
David
put
to
death
for
no
reason
6
Saul
listened
to
Jonathan
and
Saul
swore
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
he
will
not
be
put
to
death
7
Afterward
Jonathan
called
David
and
told
him
all
these
things
So
Jonathan
brought
David
to
Saul
and
he
continued
to
serve
him
as
before
8
In
time
war
broke
out
again
and
David
went
out
and
fought
against
the
Philistines
and
struck
them
down
with
a
great
slaughter
and
they
fled
from
before
him
9
And
a
bad
spirit
from
Jehovah
came
upon
Saul
when
he
was
sitting
in
his
house
with
his
spear
in
his
hand
while
David
was
playing
music
on
the
harp
10
Saul
tried
to
pin
David
to
the
wall
with
the
spear
but
he
eluded
Saul
who
drove
the
spear
into
the
wall
David
fled
and
escaped
during
that
night
11
Saul
later
sent
messengers
to
Davids
house
to
watch
it
and
to
kill
him
in
the
morning
but
Davids
wife
Michal
told
him
If
you
do
not
escape
tonight
tomorrow
you
will
be
a
dead
man
12
Immediately
Michal
let
David
down
through
the
window
so
that
he
could
run
away
and
escape
13
Michal
took
the
teraphim
statue
and
placed
it
on
the
bed
and
she
put
a
net
of
goat
hair
at
the
place
of
his
head
and
she
covered
it
with
a
garment
14
Saul
now
sent
messengers
to
take
David
but
she
said
He
is
sick
15
So
Saul
sent
the
messengers
to
see
David
and
told
them
Bring
him
to
me
on
his
bed
to
have
him
put
to
death
16
When
the
messengers
came
in
there
was
the
teraphim
statue
on
the
bed
and
a
net
of
goat
hair
where
his
head
would
have
been
17
Saul
said
to
Michal
Why
did
you
trick
me
like
this
and
send
my
enemy
away
so
that
he
could
escape
Michal
replied
to
Saul
He
said
to
me
Send
me
away
or
I
will
kill
you
18
Now
David
had
run
away
and
escaped
and
he
came
to
Samuel
at
Ramah
He
told
him
all
that
Saul
had
done
to
him
Then
he
and
Samuel
went
away
and
they
stayed
in
Naioth
19
In
time
it
was
reported
to
Saul
Look
David
is
in
Naioth
in
Ramah
20
At
once
Saul
sent
messengers
to
seize
David
When
they
saw
the
elderly
ones
of
the
prophets
prophesying
and
Samuel
standing
and
presiding
over
them
the
spirit
of
God
came
to
be
upon
Sauls
messengers
and
they
began
behaving
as
prophets
as
well
21
When
they
told
it
to
Saul
he
immediately
sent
other
messengers
and
they
too
began
behaving
as
prophets
So
Saul
sent
messengers
again
a
third
group
and
they
too
began
behaving
as
prophets
22
Finally
he
also
went
to
Ramah
When
he
reached
the
great
cistern
that
is
in
Secu
he
asked
Where
are
Samuel
and
David
They
replied
There
in
Naioth
in
Ramah
23
While
Saul
was
on
his
way
from
there
to
Naioth
in
Ramah
the
spirit
of
God
came
upon
him
as
well
and
he
walked
along
behaving
as
a
prophet
until
he
came
into
Naioth
in
Ramah
24
He
also
stripped
off
his
garments
and
he
too
behaved
as
a
prophet
before
Samuel
and
he
lay
there
naked
all
that
day
and
all
that
night
That
is
why
they
say
Is
Saul
also
among
the
prophets
1
Then
David
ran
away
from
Naioth
in
Ramah
However
he
came
to
Jonathan
and
said
What
have
I
done
What
is
my
offense
and
how
have
I
sinned
against
your
father
for
him
to
seek
my
life
2
At
this
Jonathan
said
to
him
It
is
unthinkable
You
will
not
die
Look
My
father
will
not
do
anything
great
or
small
without
disclosing
it
to
me
Why
should
my
father
hide
this
matter
from
me
This
will
not
happen
3
But
David
swore
further
and
said
Your
father
surely
knows
that
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
and
would
say
Do
not
let
Jonathan
know
this
or
he
will
be
upset
But
as
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
and
as
surely
as
you
are
living
there
is
only
a
step
between
me
and
death
4
Then
Jonathan
said
to
David
Whatever
you
say
I
will
do
for
you
5
David
said
to
Jonathan
Tomorrow
is
the
new
moon
and
I
am
certainly
expected
to
sit
with
the
king
to
eat
you
must
send
me
away
and
I
will
hide
in
the
field
until
the
evening
on
the
third
day
6
If
your
father
misses
me
at
all
then
say
David
begged
me
for
permission
to
go
quickly
to
his
city
Bethlehem
because
there
is
a
yearly
sacrifice
there
for
all
the
family
7
If
his
response
is
That
is
fine

it
means
peace
to
your
servant
But
if
he
becomes
angry
you
can
be
sure
that
he
is
determined
to
harm
me
8
Show
loyal
love
to
your
servant
for
you
have
brought
your
servant
into
Jehovahs
covenant
with
you
But
if
I
am
guilty
put
me
to
death
yourself
Why
turn
me
over
to
your
father
9
To
this
Jonathan
said
It
is
unthinkable
to
suggest
that
about
you
If
I
learn
that
my
father
is
determined
to
harm
you
would
I
not
tell
you
10
Then
David
said
to
Jonathan
Who
will
tell
me
whether
your
father
gives
you
a
harsh
answer
11
Jonathan
said
to
David
Come
let
us
go
out
into
the
field
So
both
of
them
went
out
into
the
field
12
And
Jonathan
said
to
David
Let
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
be
a
witness
that
I
will
sound
out
my
father
about
this
time
tomorrow
or
by
the
third
day
If
he
is
favorably
disposed
toward
David
will
I
not
then
send
you
word
and
disclose
it
to
you
13
But
if
my
father
intends
to
harm
you
may
Jehovah
do
that
and
more
to
Jonathan
if
I
do
not
disclose
it
to
you
and
send
you
away
in
peace
May
Jehovah
be
with
you
just
as
he
was
with
my
father
14
And
will
you
not
show
me
the
loyal
love
of
Jehovah
while
I
am
alive
and
even
when
I
die
15
Never
withdraw
your
loyal
love
from
my
household
even
when
Jehovah
wipes
out
all
the
enemies
of
David
from
the
face
of
the
earth
16
So
Jonathan
made
a
covenant
with
the
house
of
David
saying
Jehovah
will
require
it
and
call
Davids
enemies
to
account
17
So
Jonathan
had
David
swear
again
by
his
love
for
him
for
he
loved
him
as
he
loved
himself
18
Jonathan
then
said
to
him
Tomorrow
is
the
new
moon
and
you
will
be
missed
for
your
seat
will
be
vacant
19
By
the
third
day
you
will
be
missed
even
more
and
you
must
go
to
the
place
where
you
hid
the
other
day
and
stay
near
the
stone
here
20
I
will
then
shoot
three
arrows
to
one
side
of
it
as
though
I
were
shooting
at
a
target
21
When
I
send
the
attendant
I
will
say
Go
find
the
arrows
If
I
say
to
the
attendant
Look
The
arrows
are
on
this
side
of
you
get
them

then
you
may
come
back
for
as
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
it
means
everything
is
peaceful
for
you
and
there
is
no
danger
22
But
if
I
should
say
to
the
boy
Look
The
arrows
are
beyond
you

then
go
for
Jehovah
has
sent
you
away
23
As
for
the
promise
that
we
have
made
you
and
I
may
Jehovah
be
between
us
forever
24
So
David
hid
in
the
field
When
the
new
moon
came
the
king
took
his
seat
at
the
meal
to
eat
25
The
king
was
sitting
in
his
usual
seat
by
the
wall
Jonathan
was
facing
him
and
Abner
was
sitting
at
Sauls
side
but
Davids
place
was
vacant
26
Saul
did
not
say
anything
that
day
for
he
said
to
himself
Something
has
happened
so
that
he
is
not
clean
Yes
he
must
be
unclean
27
And
the
day
after
the
new
moon
on
the
second
day
Davids
place
continued
vacant
Saul
then
said
to
Jonathan
his
son
Why
has
the
son
of
Jesse
not
come
to
the
meal
either
yesterday
or
today
28
Jonathan
answered
Saul
David
begged
me
for
permission
to
go
to
Bethlehem
29
He
said
Please
permit
me
to
go
because
we
have
a
family
sacrifice
in
the
city
and
my
own
brother
summoned
me
So
if
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
please
let
me
slip
away
to
see
my
brothers
That
is
why
he
has
not
come
to
the
kings
table
30
Then
Saul
became
enraged
with
Jonathan
and
he
said
to
him
You
son
of
a
rebellious
woman
do
you
think
I
do
not
know
that
you
are
choosing
to
side
with
the
son
of
Jesse
to
your
own
shame
and
to
the
shame
of
your
mother
31
As
long
as
the
son
of
Jesse
is
alive
on
the
earth
you
and
your
kingship
will
not
be
firmly
established
So
now
send
someone
to
bring
him
to
me
for
he
must
die
32
However
Jonathan
said
to
Saul
his
father
Why
should
he
be
put
to
death
What
has
he
done
33
At
that
Saul
hurled
the
spear
at
him
to
strike
him
so
Jonathan
knew
that
his
father
was
determined
to
put
David
to
death
34
Jonathan
immediately
rose
up
from
the
table
in
the
heat
of
anger
and
he
did
not
eat
any
food
on
the
second
day
after
the
new
moon
for
he
was
upset
over
David
and
his
own
father
had
humiliated
him
35
In
the
morning
Jonathan
went
out
to
the
field
for
the
appointment
with
David
and
a
young
attendant
was
with
him
36
And
he
said
to
his
attendant
Please
run
and
find
the
arrows
that
I
shoot
The
attendant
ran
and
Jonathan
shot
the
arrow
beyond
him
37
When
the
attendant
reached
the
place
where
Jonathan
had
shot
the
arrow
Jonathan
called
out
to
the
attendant
Is
not
the
arrow
beyond
you
38
Jonathan
called
out
to
the
attendant
Hurry
Go
quickly
Do
not
delay
And
Jonathans
attendant
picked
up
the
arrows
and
came
back
to
his
master
39
The
attendant
did
not
understand
anything
about
the
matter
only
Jonathan
and
David
knew
what
was
meant
40
Then
Jonathan
gave
his
weapons
to
his
attendant
and
told
him
Go
take
them
to
the
city
41
When
the
attendant
left
David
rose
up
from
a
place
nearby
that
was
to
the
south
Then
he
fell
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
bowed
three
times
and
they
kissed
each
other
and
wept
for
each
other
but
David
wept
the
most
42
Jonathan
said
to
David
Go
in
peace
since
we
have
both
sworn
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
saying
May
Jehovah
be
between
you
and
me
and
between
your
offspring
and
my
offspring
forever
Then
David
rose
up
and
left
and
Jonathan
went
back
to
the
city
1
David
later
came
to
Nob
to
Ahimelech
the
priest
Ahimelech
began
to
tremble
when
he
met
David
and
he
said
to
him
Why
are
you
by
yourself
and
no
one
is
with
you
2
David
replied
to
Ahimelech
the
priest
The
king
instructed
me
to
do
something
but
he
said
Do
not
let
anyone
know
anything
about
the
mission
on
which
I
am
sending
you
and
about
the
instructions
I
have
given
you
I
made
an
appointment
with
my
young
men
to
meet
at
a
certain
place
3
Now
if
there
are
five
loaves
of
bread
at
your
disposal
just
give
them
to
me
or
whatever
is
available
4
But
the
priest
answered
David
There
is
no
ordinary
bread
on
hand
but
there
is
holy
bread—provided
that
the
young
men
have
kept
away
from
women
5
David
answered
the
priest
Women
have
certainly
been
kept
away
from
us
as
on
previous
occasions
when
I
went
out
on
a
campaign
If
the
bodies
of
the
young
men
are
holy
even
when
the
mission
is
ordinary
how
much
more
so
today
should
they
be
holy
6
So
the
priest
gave
him
the
holy
bread
because
there
was
no
bread
there
except
the
showbread
which
had
been
removed
from
Jehovahs
presence
to
be
replaced
by
fresh
bread
on
the
day
it
was
taken
away
7
Now
one
of
Sauls
servants
was
there
on
that
day
detained
before
Jehovah
His
name
was
Doeg
the
Edomite
the
chief
of
Sauls
shepherds
8
David
then
said
to
Ahimelech
Is
there
a
spear
or
a
sword
here
at
your
disposal
I
did
not
take
my
own
sword
or
my
weapons
with
me
because
the
kings
mission
was
urgent
9
To
this
the
priest
said
The
sword
of
Goliath
the
Philistine
whom
you
struck
down
in
the
Valley
of
Elah
is
here
wrapped
up
in
a
cloth
behind
the
ephod
If
you
want
to
take
it
for
yourself
take
it
because
it
is
the
only
one
here
David
said
There
is
none
like
it
Give
it
to
me
10
That
day
David
rose
up
and
continued
his
flight
from
Saul
and
he
eventually
came
to
King
Achish
of
Gath
11
The
servants
of
Achish
said
to
him
Is
this
not
David
the
king
of
the
land
Is
he
not
the
one
they
sang
about
when
they
danced
saying
Saul
has
struck
down
his
thousands
And
David
his
tens
of
thousands
12
David
took
these
words
to
heart
and
he
became
very
much
afraid
of
King
Achish
of
Gath
13
So
he
disguised
his
sanity
in
their
presence
and
acted
insane
while
among
them
He
was
making
marks
on
the
doors
of
the
gate
and
letting
his
saliva
run
down
his
beard
14
Finally
Achish
said
to
his
servants
You
see
that
this
man
is
crazy
Why
bring
him
to
me
15
Do
I
have
a
shortage
of
crazy
men
that
I
need
to
have
this
one
acting
crazy
before
me
Should
this
man
enter
my
house
1
So
David
went
from
there
escaping
to
the
cave
of
Adullam
When
his
brothers
and
his
fathers
entire
house
heard
of
it
they
went
down
there
to
him
2
And
all
those
who
were
in
trouble
and
in
debt
and
who
had
a
grievance
gathered
to
him
and
he
became
their
chief
There
were
about
400
men
with
him
3
David
later
went
from
there
to
Mizpeh
in
Moab
and
said
to
the
king
of
Moab
Please
let
my
father
and
mother
stay
with
you
until
I
know
what
God
will
do
for
me
4
So
he
left
them
with
the
king
of
Moab
and
they
stayed
with
him
the
whole
time
that
David
was
in
the
stronghold
5
In
time
Gad
the
prophet
said
to
David
Do
not
stay
in
the
stronghold
Go
from
there
into
the
land
of
Judah
So
David
left
and
went
into
the
forest
of
Hereth
6
Saul
heard
that
David
and
the
men
with
him
had
been
found
Saul
was
then
sitting
in
Gibeah
under
the
tamarisk
tree
on
the
high
place
with
his
spear
in
his
hand
and
all
his
servants
were
stationed
around
him
7
Then
Saul
said
to
his
servants
stationed
around
him
Listen
please
you
Benjaminites
Will
the
son
of
Jesse
also
give
fields
and
vineyards
to
all
of
you
Will
he
appoint
all
of
you
as
chiefs
of
thousands
and
chiefs
of
hundreds
8
All
of
you
have
conspired
against
me
No
one
informed
me
when
my
own
son
made
a
covenant
with
the
son
of
Jesse
Not
one
of
you
has
sympathy
for
me
and
informs
me
that
my
own
son
has
incited
my
own
servant
against
me
to
ambush
me
as
is
now
the
case
9
Then
Doeg
the
Edomite
who
was
stationed
there
over
the
servants
of
Saul
answered
I
saw
the
son
of
Jesse
come
to
Nob
to
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Ahitub
10
And
he
inquired
of
Jehovah
for
him
and
gave
him
provisions
He
even
gave
him
the
sword
of
Goliath
the
Philistine
11
At
once
the
king
sent
for
Ahimelech
son
of
Ahitub
the
priest
and
all
the
priests
of
his
fathers
house
who
were
in
Nob
So
all
of
them
came
to
the
king
12
Saul
now
said
Listen
please
you
son
of
Ahitub
to
which
he
replied
Here
I
am
my
lord
13
Saul
said
to
him
Why
have
you
conspired
against
me
you
and
the
son
of
Jesse
by
giving
him
bread
and
a
sword
and
by
making
an
inquiry
of
God
for
him
He
opposes
me
and
waits
in
ambush
as
is
now
the
case
14
At
this
Ahimelech
answered
the
king
Who
among
all
your
servants
is
as
trustworthy
as
David
He
is
the
kings
son-in-law
and
a
chief
over
your
bodyguard
and
honored
in
your
house
15
Was
today
the
first
time
I
inquired
of
God
for
him
What
you
are
saying
is
unthinkable
on
my
part
Do
not
let
the
king
hold
anything
against
his
servant
and
against
my
fathers
entire
house
for
your
servant
did
not
know
a
single
thing
about
any
of
this
16
But
the
king
said
You
will
surely
die
Ahimelech
you
along
with
all
your
fathers
house
17
With
that
the
king
said
to
the
guards
stationed
around
him
Turn
and
kill
the
priests
of
Jehovah
because
they
have
sided
with
David
They
knew
that
he
was
a
runaway
and
they
did
not
inform
me
But
the
kings
servants
did
not
want
to
lift
their
hands
to
assault
the
priests
of
Jehovah
18
Then
the
king
said
to
Doeg
You
turn
and
assault
the
priests
Immediately
Doeg
the
Edomite
went
and
assaulted
the
priests
himself
He
killed
on
that
day
85
men
wearing
the
linen
ephod
19
He
also
struck
Nob
the
city
of
the
priests
with
the
sword
man
as
well
as
woman
child
as
well
as
infant
bull
donkey
and
sheep
he
put
to
the
sword
20
However
one
son
of
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Ahitub
whose
name
was
Abiathar
escaped
and
ran
away
to
follow
David
21
Abiathar
told
David
Saul
has
killed
the
priests
of
Jehovah
22
At
this
David
said
to
Abiathar
I
knew
on
that
day
when
Doeg
the
Edomite
was
there
that
he
would
be
sure
to
tell
Saul
I
am
personally
responsible
for
the
death
of
everyone
in
your
fathers
house
23
Stay
with
me
Do
not
be
afraid
for
whoever
seeks
your
life
seeks
my
life
you
are
under
my
protection
1
In
time
David
was
told
The
Philistines
are
fighting
against
Keilah
and
they
are
raiding
the
threshing
floors
2
So
David
inquired
of
Jehovah
Should
I
go
and
strike
down
these
Philistines
Jehovah
said
to
David
Go
strike
down
the
Philistines
and
rescue
Keilah
3
But
the
men
of
David
said
to
him
Look
We
are
afraid
while
here
in
Judah
how
much
more
so
if
we
go
to
Keilah
against
the
battle
line
of
the
Philistines
4
So
David
inquired
once
again
of
Jehovah
Jehovah
now
answered
him
Rise
up
go
down
to
Keilah
because
I
will
give
the
Philistines
into
your
hand
5
So
David
went
with
his
men
to
Keilah
and
fought
against
the
Philistines
he
carried
off
their
livestock
and
struck
them
down
with
a
great
slaughter
and
David
rescued
the
inhabitants
of
Keilah
6
Now
when
Abiathar
the
son
of
Ahimelech
ran
away
to
David
at
Keilah
he
had
an
ephod
with
him
7
Saul
was
told
David
has
come
to
Keilah
Then
Saul
said
God
has
handed
him
over
to
me
for
he
has
trapped
himself
by
entering
a
city
with
gates
and
bars
8
So
Saul
summoned
all
the
people
to
war
to
go
down
to
Keilah
and
besiege
David
and
his
men
9
When
David
learned
that
Saul
was
plotting
against
him
he
said
to
Abiathar
the
priest
Bring
the
ephod
here
10
Then
David
said
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
your
servant
has
indeed
heard
that
Saul
intends
to
come
to
Keilah
to
destroy
the
city
because
of
me
11
Will
the
leaders
of
Keilah
surrender
me
into
his
hand
Will
Saul
come
down
as
your
servant
has
heard
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
please
tell
your
servant
To
this
Jehovah
said
He
will
come
down
12
David
asked
Will
the
leaders
of
Keilah
surrender
me
and
my
men
into
Sauls
hand
Jehovah
replied
They
will
surrender
you
13
At
once
David
rose
up
with
his
men
about
600
in
number
and
they
left
Keilah
and
moved
about
wherever
they
could
When
Saul
was
told
that
David
had
escaped
from
Keilah
he
did
not
go
out
after
him
14
David
stayed
in
the
wilderness
in
places
difficult
to
approach
in
the
mountainous
region
of
the
wilderness
of
Ziph
Saul
searched
for
him
constantly
but
Jehovah
did
not
give
him
into
his
hand
15
David
was
aware
that
Saul
had
gone
out
to
seek
his
life
while
David
was
in
the
wilderness
of
Ziph
at
Horesh
16
Jonathan
the
son
of
Saul
now
went
out
to
David
at
Horesh
and
he
helped
him
find
strength
in
Jehovah
17
He
said
to
him
Do
not
be
afraid
for
my
father
Saul
will
not
find
you
you
will
be
king
over
Israel
and
I
will
become
second
to
you
and
my
father
Saul
also
knows
that
18
Then
the
two
of
them
made
a
covenant
before
Jehovah
and
David
stayed
in
Horesh
and
Jonathan
went
to
his
home
19
The
men
of
Ziph
later
went
up
to
Saul
at
Gibeah
and
said
Is
not
David
hiding
near
us
in
the
places
difficult
to
approach
at
Horesh
on
the
hill
of
Hachilah
which
is
south
of
Jeshimon
20
Whenever
it
pleases
you
to
come
down
O
king
come
and
we
will
surrender
him
into
the
hand
of
the
king
21
At
this
Saul
said
May
you
be
blessed
by
Jehovah
for
you
have
shown
compassion
to
me
22
Please
go
and
try
to
find
out
exactly
where
he
is
and
who
saw
him
there
for
I
have
been
told
that
he
is
very
cunning
23
Carefully
ascertain
where
all
his
hiding
places
are
and
return
to
me
with
the
evidence
I
will
then
go
with
you
and
if
he
is
in
the
land
I
will
search
him
out
among
all
the
thousands
of
Judah
24
So
they
left
and
went
to
Ziph
ahead
of
Saul
while
David
and
his
men
were
in
the
wilderness
of
Maon
in
the
Arabah
to
the
south
of
Jeshimon
25
Then
Saul
came
with
his
men
to
look
for
him
When
David
was
told
he
at
once
went
down
to
the
crag
and
stayed
in
the
wilderness
of
Maon
When
Saul
heard
this
he
chased
after
David
into
the
wilderness
of
Maon
26
As
Saul
came
to
one
side
of
the
mountain
David
and
his
men
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
David
was
hurrying
to
get
away
from
Saul
but
Saul
and
his
men
were
closing
in
on
David
and
his
men
to
capture
them
27
But
a
messenger
came
to
Saul
saying
Come
quickly
for
the
Philistines
have
made
a
raid
on
the
land
28
At
that
Saul
stopped
chasing
after
David
and
went
to
confront
the
Philistines
That
is
why
that
place
was
named
the
Crag
of
the
Divisions
29
Then
David
made
his
way
up
from
there
and
stayed
in
the
places
difficult
to
approach
at
En-gedi
1
As
soon
as
Saul
returned
from
pursuing
the
Philistines
they
told
him
Look
David
is
in
the
wilderness
of
En-gedi
2
So
Saul
took
3000
men
chosen
from
all
Israel
and
went
to
look
for
David
and
his
men
on
the
rocky
cliffs
of
the
mountain
goats
3
Saul
came
to
the
stone
sheepfolds
along
the
road
where
there
was
a
cave
and
he
went
in
to
relieve
himself
while
David
and
his
men
were
sitting
in
the
recesses
at
the
back
of
the
cave
4
Davids
men
said
to
him
This
is
the
day
on
which
Jehovah
is
saying
to
you
Look
I
am
giving
your
enemy
into
your
hand
and
you
can
do
to
him
whatever
seems
good
to
you
So
David
rose
up
and
quietly
cut
off
the
edge
of
Sauls
sleeveless
coat
5
But
afterward
Davids
heart
kept
striking
him
because
he
had
cut
off
the
edge
of
Sauls
sleeveless
coat
6
He
said
to
his
men
It
is
unthinkable
from
Jehovahs
standpoint
that
I
should
do
such
a
thing
to
my
lord
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
by
lifting
my
hand
against
him
for
he
is
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
7
So
David
restrained
his
men
with
these
words
and
he
did
not
allow
them
to
attack
Saul
As
for
Saul
he
rose
up
from
the
cave
and
went
on
his
way
8
Then
David
got
up
and
went
out
from
the
cave
and
called
out
after
Saul
My
lord
the
king
When
Saul
looked
behind
him
David
bowed
down
low
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
prostrated
himself
9
David
said
to
Saul
Why
do
you
listen
to
the
words
of
men
who
say
Look
David
is
seeking
to
harm
you
10
This
very
day
your
own
eyes
have
seen
how
Jehovah
gave
you
into
my
hand
in
the
cave
But
when
someone
said
to
kill
you
I
had
pity
on
you
and
said
I
will
not
lift
my
hand
against
my
lord
for
he
is
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
11
And
look
my
father
yes
see
the
edge
of
your
sleeveless
coat
in
my
hand
for
when
I
cut
off
the
edge
of
your
sleeveless
coat
I
did
not
kill
you
You
can
now
see
and
understand
that
I
do
not
intend
to
harm
you
or
to
rebel
and
I
have
not
sinned
against
you
whereas
you
are
hunting
me
down
to
take
my
life
12
May
Jehovah
judge
between
you
and
me
and
may
Jehovah
take
vengeance
on
you
for
me
but
my
hand
will
not
come
against
you
13
Just
as
the
ancient
proverb
says
From
the
wicked
comes
wickedness

but
my
hand
will
not
come
against
you
14
After
whom
has
the
king
of
Israel
gone
out
Whom
are
you
chasing
A
dead
dog
A
single
flea
15
May
Jehovah
be
the
judge
and
he
will
judge
between
you
and
me
and
he
will
see
and
will
plead
my
case
and
judge
me
and
rescue
me
from
your
hand
16
At
the
moment
that
David
finished
speaking
these
words
to
him
Saul
said
Is
this
your
voice
my
son
David
And
Saul
began
to
weep
loudly
17
He
said
to
David
You
are
more
righteous
than
I
am
for
you
have
treated
me
well
and
I
have
repaid
you
with
evil
18
Yes
today
you
have
told
me
of
the
good
you
did
by
not
killing
me
when
Jehovah
surrendered
me
into
your
hand
19
For
what
man
finds
his
enemy
and
sends
him
on
his
way
unharmed
Jehovah
will
reward
you
with
good
because
of
what
you
have
done
for
me
today
20
And
now
look
I
know
that
you
will
surely
rule
as
king
and
that
in
your
hand
the
kingdom
of
Israel
will
endure
21
Now
swear
to
me
by
Jehovah
that
you
will
not
wipe
out
my
descendants
after
me
and
that
you
will
not
annihilate
my
name
out
of
my
fathers
house
22
So
David
swore
to
Saul
after
which
Saul
went
home
But
David
and
his
men
went
up
to
the
stronghold
1
In
time
Samuel
died
and
all
Israel
gathered
together
to
mourn
for
him
and
to
bury
him
at
his
house
in
Ramah
Then
David
rose
and
went
down
to
the
wilderness
of
Paran
2
Now
there
was
a
man
in
Maon
whose
work
was
in
Carmel
The
man
was
very
wealthy
he
had
3000
sheep
and
1000
goats
and
he
was
then
shearing
his
sheep
at
Carmel
3
The
mans
name
was
Nabal
and
his
wifes
name
was
Abigail
The
wife
was
discerning
and
beautiful
but
the
husband
a
Calebite
was
harsh
and
he
behaved
badly
4
David
heard
in
the
wilderness
that
Nabal
was
shearing
his
sheep
5
So
David
sent
ten
young
men
to
him
and
David
told
the
young
men
Go
up
to
Carmel
and
when
you
come
to
Nabal
ask
him
in
my
name
about
his
welfare
6
Then
say
May
you
live
long
and
may
you
be
well
and
may
your
household
be
well
and
may
all
that
you
have
be
well
7
Now
I
hear
that
you
are
doing
your
shearing
When
your
shepherds
were
with
us
we
did
not
harm
them
and
they
found
nothing
missing
the
whole
time
they
were
in
Carmel
8
Ask
your
young
men
and
they
will
tell
you
May
my
young
men
find
favor
in
your
eyes
because
we
have
come
at
a
joyous
time
Please
give
to
your
servants
and
to
your
son
David
whatever
you
can
spare
9
So
Davids
young
men
went
and
told
all
of
this
to
Nabal
in
Davids
name
When
they
finished
10
Nabal
answered
Davids
servants
Who
is
David
and
who
is
the
son
of
Jesse
Nowadays
many
servants
are
breaking
away
from
their
masters
11
Do
I
have
to
take
my
bread
and
my
water
and
the
meat
that
I
butchered
for
my
shearers
and
give
it
to
men
who
come
from
who
knows
where
12
At
that
Davids
young
men
returned
and
reported
all
these
words
to
him
13
David
immediately
said
to
his
men
Everyone
strap
on
your
sword
So
they
all
strapped
on
their
swords
and
David
also
strapped
on
his
own
sword
and
about
400
men
went
up
with
David
while
200
men
stayed
with
the
baggage
14
Meanwhile
one
of
the
servants
reported
to
Abigail
Nabals
wife
Look
David
sent
messengers
from
the
wilderness
to
wish
our
master
well
but
he
screamed
insults
at
them
15
Those
men
were
very
good
to
us
They
never
harmed
us
and
we
did
not
miss
a
single
thing
the
whole
time
we
were
together
with
them
in
the
fields
16
They
were
like
a
protective
wall
around
us
both
by
night
and
by
day
the
whole
time
we
were
with
them
shepherding
the
flock
17
Now
decide
what
you
are
going
to
do
for
disaster
has
been
determined
against
our
master
and
against
all
his
house
and
he
is
such
a
worthless
man
that
no
one
can
speak
to
him
18
So
Abigail
quickly
took
200
loaves
of
bread
two
large
jars
of
wine
five
dressed
sheep
five
seah
measures
of
roasted
grain
100
cakes
of
raisins
and
200
cakes
of
pressed
figs
and
put
all
of
it
on
the
donkeys
19
Then
she
said
to
her
servants
Go
on
ahead
of
me
I
will
follow
you
But
she
said
nothing
to
her
husband
Nabal
20
While
she
was
riding
on
the
donkey
and
going
down
under
cover
of
the
mountain
just
then
David
and
his
men
were
coming
down
toward
her
and
she
met
them
21
Now
David
had
been
saying
It
was
for
nothing
that
I
guarded
everything
that
belongs
to
this
fellow
in
the
wilderness
Not
a
single
thing
belonging
to
him
went
missing
and
yet
he
repays
me
evil
for
good
22
May
God
do
the
same
and
more
to
the
enemies
of
David
if
I
allow
a
single
male
of
his
to
survive
until
the
morning
23
When
Abigail
caught
sight
of
David
she
hurried
down
off
the
donkey
and
threw
herself
facedown
before
David
bowing
to
the
ground
24
She
then
fell
at
his
feet
and
said
My
lord
let
the
blame
be
on
me
let
your
servant
girl
speak
to
you
and
listen
to
the
words
of
your
servant
girl
25
Please
do
not
let
my
lord
pay
attention
to
this
worthless
Nabal
for
he
is
just
like
his
name
Nabal
is
his
name
and
senselessness
is
with
him
But
I
your
servant
girl
did
not
see
my
lords
young
men
whom
you
sent
26
And
now
my
lord
as
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
and
as
you
are
living
it
is
Jehovah
who
has
held
you
back
from
incurring
bloodguilt
and
from
taking
revenge
with
your
own
hand
May
your
enemies
and
those
seeking
injury
to
my
lord
become
like
Nabal
27
Now
let
this
gift
that
your
servant
girl
has
brought
to
my
lord
be
given
to
the
young
men
who
are
following
my
lord
28
Pardon
please
the
transgression
of
your
servant
girl
for
Jehovah
will
without
fail
make
for
my
lord
a
lasting
house
because
my
lord
is
fighting
the
wars
of
Jehovah
and
no
evil
has
been
found
in
you
all
your
days
29
When
someone
rises
up
to
pursue
you
and
seeks
your
life
the
life
of
my
lord
will
be
wrapped
securely
in
the
bag
of
life
with
Jehovah
your
God
but
the
lives
of
your
enemies
he
will
hurl
away
like
stones
from
a
sling
30
And
when
Jehovah
has
done
for
my
lord
all
the
good
things
he
has
promised
and
he
appoints
you
as
leader
over
Israel
31
you
will
have
no
remorse
or
regret
in
your
heart
for
shedding
blood
without
cause
and
for
letting
the
hand
of
my
lord
take
revenge
When
Jehovah
confers
good
upon
my
lord
remember
your
servant
girl
32
At
this
David
said
to
Abigail
Praise
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
who
sent
you
this
day
to
meet
me
33
And
blessed
be
your
good
sense
May
you
be
blessed
for
restraining
me
this
day
from
incurring
bloodguilt
and
from
taking
revenge
with
my
own
hands
34
Otherwise
as
surely
as
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
who
held
me
back
from
harming
you
is
living
if
you
had
not
come
quickly
to
meet
me
by
morning
there
would
not
have
remained
a
single
male
belonging
to
Nabal
35
With
that
David
accepted
from
her
what
she
had
brought
him
and
said
to
her
Go
up
in
peace
to
your
house
See
I
have
listened
to
you
and
I
will
grant
your
request
36
Abigail
later
went
back
to
Nabal
who
was
feasting
like
a
king
in
his
house
and
Nabal
was
in
a
good
mood
and
was
as
drunk
as
could
be
She
did
not
tell
him
a
single
thing
until
the
morning
light
37
In
the
morning
when
Nabal
was
sober
his
wife
told
him
these
things
And
his
heart
became
like
a
dead
mans
and
he
lay
paralyzed
like
a
stone
38
About
ten
days
later
Jehovah
struck
Nabal
and
he
died
39
When
David
heard
that
Nabal
had
died
he
said
Praise
Jehovah
who
has
pleaded
my
case
of
reproach
from
Nabal
and
has
kept
his
servant
from
doing
anything
bad
and
Jehovah
has
brought
the
badness
of
Nabal
back
on
his
own
head
Then
David
sent
word
to
propose
to
Abigail
to
take
her
as
his
wife
40
So
Davids
servants
came
to
Abigail
at
Carmel
and
said
to
her
David
has
sent
us
to
you
to
take
you
as
his
wife
41
She
immediately
rose
up
and
bowed
with
her
face
to
the
ground
and
said
Here
is
your
slave
as
a
servant
to
wash
the
feet
of
the
servants
of
my
lord
42
Then
Abigail
quickly
rose
up
and
rode
on
her
donkey
with
five
of
her
female
servants
walking
behind
her
she
accompanied
the
messengers
of
David
and
became
his
wife
43
David
had
also
married
Ahinoam
from
Jezreel
and
both
women
became
his
wives
44
But
Saul
had
given
his
daughter
Michal
Davids
wife
to
Palti
the
son
of
Laish
who
was
from
Gallim
1
In
time
the
men
of
Ziph
came
to
Saul
at
Gibeah
saying
Is
David
not
hiding
on
the
hill
of
Hachilah
facing
Jeshimon
2
So
Saul
rose
up
and
went
down
to
the
wilderness
of
Ziph
with
3000
chosen
men
of
Israel
to
look
for
David
in
the
wilderness
of
Ziph
3
Saul
camped
on
the
hill
of
Hachilah
which
faces
Jeshimon
by
the
road
David
was
then
living
in
the
wilderness
and
he
learned
that
Saul
had
come
into
the
wilderness
after
him
4
So
David
sent
spies
to
verify
that
Saul
had
indeed
come
5
David
later
went
to
the
place
where
Saul
had
encamped
and
David
saw
the
place
where
Saul
and
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
the
chief
of
his
army
were
lying
asleep
Saul
lay
asleep
in
the
camp
enclosure
with
the
troops
camping
all
around
him
6
Then
David
said
to
Ahimelech
the
Hittite
and
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
the
brother
of
Joab
Who
will
go
down
with
me
into
the
camp
to
Saul
Abishai
replied
I
will
go
down
with
you
7
So
David
and
Abishai
made
their
way
to
the
troops
by
night
and
they
found
Saul
lying
asleep
in
the
camp
enclosure
with
his
spear
stuck
into
the
ground
next
to
his
head
Abner
and
the
troops
were
lying
all
around
him
8
Abishai
now
said
to
David
Today
God
has
surrendered
your
enemy
into
your
hand
And
now
please
let
me
pin
him
to
the
ground
with
the
spear
just
once
and
I
will
not
need
to
do
it
twice
9
However
David
said
to
Abishai
Do
not
harm
him
for
who
can
lift
his
hand
against
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
and
remain
innocent
10
David
continued
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
Jehovah
himself
will
strike
him
down
or
his
day
will
come
and
he
will
die
or
he
will
go
down
into
battle
and
perish
11
It
is
unthinkable
from
Jehovahs
standpoint
for
me
to
lift
my
hand
against
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
So
now
take
please
the
spear
next
to
his
head
and
the
water
jug
and
let
us
be
on
our
way
12
So
David
took
the
spear
and
the
water
jug
from
next
to
Sauls
head
and
they
went
away
No
one
saw
or
noticed
them
or
woke
up
for
they
were
all
asleep
because
a
deep
sleep
from
Jehovah
had
fallen
upon
them
13
Then
David
crossed
to
the
other
side
and
stood
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
some
distance
away
with
a
considerable
space
between
them
14
David
called
out
to
the
troops
and
to
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
saying
Abner
will
you
not
answer
Abner
answered
Who
are
you
who
calls
to
the
king
15
David
said
to
Abner
Are
you
not
a
man
And
who
is
like
you
in
Israel
So
why
did
you
not
keep
watch
over
your
lord
the
king
For
one
of
the
soldiers
came
in
to
do
away
with
your
lord
the
king
16
What
you
have
done
is
not
good
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
you
deserve
to
die
because
you
have
not
kept
watch
over
your
lord
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
Now
look
around
Where
are
the
kings
spear
and
the
water
jug
that
were
next
to
his
head
17
Then
Saul
recognized
the
voice
of
David
and
said
Is
this
your
voice
my
son
David
David
replied
It
is
my
voice
my
lord
the
king
18
He
added
Why
is
my
lord
chasing
after
his
servant
for
what
have
I
done
and
what
am
I
guilty
of
19
My
lord
the
king
please
listen
to
the
words
of
his
servant
If
it
is
Jehovah
who
incited
you
against
me
let
him
accept
my
grain
offering
But
if
men
have
incited
you
they
are
cursed
before
Jehovah
because
they
have
driven
me
away
today
from
being
united
with
Jehovahs
inheritance
saying
Go
serve
other
gods
20
And
now
do
not
let
my
blood
fall
to
the
ground
away
from
the
presence
of
Jehovah
for
the
king
of
Israel
has
gone
out
to
look
for
a
single
flea
as
if
he
were
chasing
a
partridge
on
the
mountains
21
In
turn
Saul
said
I
have
sinned
Come
back
my
son
David
for
I
will
do
you
no
more
harm
because
you
regarded
my
life
as
precious
this
day
Yes
I
have
acted
foolishly
and
have
made
a
terrible
mistake
22
David
answered
Here
is
the
spear
of
the
king
Let
one
of
the
young
men
come
over
and
take
it
23
It
is
Jehovah
who
will
repay
each
one
for
his
own
righteousness
and
his
own
faithfulness
for
today
Jehovah
gave
you
into
my
hand
but
I
was
unwilling
to
lift
my
hand
against
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
24
Look
Just
as
your
life
was
precious
to
me
this
day
so
may
my
life
be
precious
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
may
he
rescue
me
out
of
all
distress
25
Saul
replied
to
David
May
you
be
blessed
my
son
David
You
will
surely
do
great
things
and
you
will
surely
prevail
Then
David
went
on
his
way
and
Saul
returned
to
his
place
1
However
David
said
in
his
heart
One
day
I
will
perish
by
Sauls
hand
The
best
thing
for
me
is
to
escape
to
the
land
of
the
Philistines
then
Saul
will
give
up
looking
for
me
in
all
the
territory
of
Israel
and
I
will
escape
from
his
hand
2
So
David
rose
up
with
the
600
men
who
were
with
him
and
went
over
to
Achish
the
son
of
Maoch
the
king
of
Gath
3
David
stayed
with
Achish
in
Gath
he
and
his
men
each
man
with
his
household
With
David
were
his
two
wives
Ahinoam
of
Jezreel
and
Abigail
the
Carmelite
Nabals
widow
4
When
report
was
made
to
Saul
that
David
had
run
away
to
Gath
he
stopped
searching
for
him
5
Then
David
said
to
Achish
If
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
let
them
give
me
a
place
in
one
of
the
cities
of
the
countryside
so
that
I
may
live
there
Why
should
your
servant
live
in
the
royal
city
with
you
6
So
Achish
gave
him
Ziklag
on
that
day
That
is
why
Ziklag
belongs
to
the
kings
of
Judah
down
to
this
day
7
The
length
of
time
that
David
lived
in
the
countryside
of
the
Philistines
was
a
year
and
four
months
8
David
would
go
up
with
his
men
to
raid
the
Geshurites
the
Girzites
and
the
Amalekites
for
they
were
inhabiting
the
land
that
extended
from
Telam
as
far
as
Shur
and
down
to
the
land
of
Egypt
9
When
David
would
attack
the
land
he
preserved
neither
man
nor
woman
alive
but
he
took
the
flocks
herds
donkeys
camels
and
clothing
after
which
he
would
return
to
Achish
10
Then
Achish
would
ask
Where
did
you
make
a
raid
today
David
would
reply
Against
the
south
of
Judah
or
Against
the
south
of
the
Jerahmeelites
or
Against
the
south
of
the
Kenites
11
David
did
not
spare
alive
any
man
or
woman
to
be
brought
to
Gath
saying
That
they
may
not
tell
them
about
us
and
say
This
is
what
David
did
And
that
was
his
practice
the
whole
time
he
lived
in
the
countryside
of
the
Philistines
12
So
Achish
believed
David
saying
to
himself
He
has
certainly
become
a
stench
among
his
people
Israel
so
he
will
always
be
my
servant
1
In
those
days
the
Philistines
assembled
their
armies
for
war
against
Israel
So
Achish
said
to
David
You
know
of
course
that
you
and
your
men
will
go
out
into
battle
with
me
2
At
that
David
said
to
Achish
You
surely
know
what
your
servant
will
do
Achish
said
to
David
That
is
why
I
will
appoint
you
as
my
permanent
bodyguard
3
Now
Samuel
had
died
and
all
Israel
had
mourned
him
and
had
buried
him
in
Ramah
his
own
city
And
Saul
had
removed
the
spirit
mediums
and
the
fortune-tellers
from
the
land
4
The
Philistines
assembled
and
went
and
set
up
camp
in
Shunem
So
Saul
assembled
all
Israel
and
they
set
up
camp
in
Gilboa
5
When
Saul
saw
the
camp
of
the
Philistines
he
was
afraid
and
his
heart
trembled
greatly
6
Although
Saul
would
inquire
of
Jehovah
Jehovah
never
answered
him
either
in
dreams
or
by
the
Urim
or
through
the
prophets
7
Finally
Saul
said
to
his
servants
Find
me
a
woman
who
is
a
spirit
medium
and
I
will
go
and
consult
her
His
servants
replied
Look
There
is
a
woman
who
is
a
spirit
medium
in
En-dor
8
So
Saul
disguised
himself
and
put
on
other
garments
and
went
to
the
woman
by
night
with
two
of
his
men
He
said
Use
divination
please
by
acting
as
a
spirit
medium
and
bring
up
for
me
the
one
whom
I
designate
to
you
9
However
the
woman
said
to
him
You
must
know
what
Saul
did
how
he
removed
the
spirit
mediums
and
the
fortune-tellers
from
the
land
Why
then
are
you
trying
to
trap
me
to
have
me
put
to
death
10
Saul
then
swore
to
her
by
Jehovah
saying
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
you
will
not
incur
any
guilt
in
this
matter
11
At
this
the
woman
said
Whom
should
I
bring
up
for
you
He
replied
Bring
up
Samuel
for
me
12
When
the
woman
saw
Samuel

she
cried
out
at
the
top
of
her
voice
and
said
to
Saul
Why
did
you
trick
me
You
are
Saul
13
The
king
said
to
her
Do
not
be
afraid
but
what
do
you
see
The
woman
replied
to
Saul
I
see
one
like
a
god
coming
up
out
of
the
earth
14
At
once
he
asked
her
What
does
he
look
like
to
which
she
said
It
is
an
old
man
coming
up
and
he
is
clothed
in
a
sleeveless
coat
At
that
Saul
realized
that
it
was
Samuel

and
he
bowed
low
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
prostrated
himself
15
Then
Samuel
said
to
Saul
Why
have
you
disturbed
me
by
having
me
brought
up
Saul
replied
I
am
in
great
trouble
The
Philistines
are
fighting
against
me
and
God
has
departed
from
me
and
no
longer
answers
me
either
through
the
prophets
or
in
dreams
so
that
is
why
I
am
calling
on
you
to
let
me
know
what
I
should
do
16
And
Samuel
said
Why
do
you
inquire
of
me
now
that
Jehovah
has
departed
from
you
and
has
become
your
adversary
17
Jehovah
will
do
for
himself
what
he
foretold
through
me
Jehovah
will
rip
the
kingdom
out
of
your
hands
and
give
it
to
one
of
your
fellow
men
David
18
Because
you
did
not
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
and
you
did
not
execute
his
burning
anger
against
the
Amalekites
that
is
why
Jehovah
is
doing
this
to
you
this
day
19
Jehovah
will
also
give
both
Israel
and
you
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
and
tomorrow
you
and
your
sons
will
be
with
me
Jehovah
will
also
give
the
army
of
Israel
into
the
hands
of
the
Philistines
20
At
once
Saul
fell
full
length
on
the
ground
and
became
very
much
afraid
because
of
Samuels
words
And
there
was
no
strength
left
in
him
because
he
had
not
eaten
food
all
day
and
all
night
21
When
the
woman
came
to
Saul
and
saw
that
he
had
been
greatly
disturbed
she
said
to
him
Here
your
servant
has
obeyed
what
you
said
and
I
risked
my
life
and
did
what
you
told
me
to
do
22
Now
please
listen
to
what
your
servant
has
to
say
Let
me
set
before
you
a
piece
of
bread
then
eat
so
that
you
will
have
some
strength
to
go
on
your
way
23
But
he
refused
and
said
I
am
not
going
to
eat
However
his
servants
and
also
the
woman
kept
urging
him
Finally
he
listened
to
them
and
got
up
from
the
ground
and
sat
on
the
bed
24
The
woman
had
a
fattened
calf
in
the
house
so
she
quickly
slaughtered
it
and
took
flour
and
kneaded
dough
and
baked
it
into
unleavened
bread
25
She
served
them
to
Saul
and
his
servants
and
they
ate
After
that
they
rose
up
and
left
during
the
night
1
The
Philistines
assembled
all
their
armies
at
Aphek
while
the
Israelites
were
camping
by
the
spring
in
Jezreel
2
And
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
were
passing
by
with
their
hundreds
and
their
thousands
and
David
and
his
men
were
marching
at
the
rear
with
Achish
3
But
the
princes
of
the
Philistines
said
Why
are
these
Hebrews
here
Achish
replied
to
the
princes
of
the
Philistines
This
is
David
the
servant
of
King
Saul
of
Israel
who
has
been
with
me
for
a
year
or
more
I
have
not
found
any
fault
in
him
from
the
day
he
deserted
to
me
until
today
4
But
the
princes
of
the
Philistines
became
indignant
at
him
and
they
said
to
him
Make
the
man
go
back
Let
him
return
to
the
place
where
you
assigned
him
Do
not
let
him
go
down
with
us
into
the
battle
so
that
he
will
not
turn
against
us
during
the
battle
For
what
better
way
to
put
himself
in
favor
with
his
lord
than
with
the
heads
of
our
men
5
Is
this
not
the
David
about
whom
they
sang
when
they
danced
saying
Saul
has
struck
down
his
thousands
And
David
his
tens
of
thousands
6
So
Achish
summoned
David
and
said
to
him
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
you
are
upright
and
I
am
pleased
to
have
you
go
on
the
campaign
with
my
army
for
I
have
not
found
any
fault
with
you
from
the
day
you
came
to
me
until
today
But
the
lords
do
not
trust
you
7
So
return
in
peace
and
do
not
do
anything
to
displease
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
8
However
David
said
to
Achish
Why
what
have
I
done
What
fault
have
you
found
in
your
servant
from
the
day
that
I
came
to
you
until
today
Why
should
I
not
come
with
you
and
fight
against
the
enemies
of
my
lord
the
king
9
Achish
answered
David
From
my
standpoint
you
have
been
as
good
as
an
angel
of
God
But
the
princes
of
the
Philistines
have
said
Do
not
let
him
go
up
with
us
into
the
battle
10
Now
get
up
early
in
the
morning
with
the
servants
of
your
lord
who
came
with
you
rise
up
and
leave
early
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
it
is
light
11
So
David
and
his
men
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
to
return
to
the
land
of
the
Philistines
and
the
Philistines
went
up
to
Jezreel
1
When
David
and
his
men
came
to
Ziklag
on
the
third
day
the
Amalekites
had
made
a
raid
on
the
south
and
on
Ziklag
and
they
had
attacked
Ziklag
and
burned
it
with
fire
2
They
had
taken
captive
the
women
and
all
who
were
in
it
from
the
smallest
to
the
greatest
They
had
not
killed
anyone
but
they
had
carried
them
off
and
gone
on
their
way
3
When
David
and
his
men
came
to
the
city
they
found
it
burned
down
and
their
wives
and
their
sons
and
their
daughters
had
been
carried
off
captive
4
So
David
and
the
men
with
him
began
weeping
loudly
until
they
had
no
strength
left
to
weep
5
Davids
two
wives
had
also
been
carried
off
captive
Ahinoam
of
Jezreel
and
Abigail
the
widow
of
Nabal
the
Carmelite
6
David
was
very
distressed
because
the
men
were
talking
of
stoning
him
for
all
the
men
had
become
very
bitter
over
the
loss
of
their
sons
and
daughters
But
David
strengthened
himself
by
Jehovah
his
God
7
David
then
said
to
Abiathar
the
priest
the
son
of
Ahimelech
Please
bring
the
ephod
here
So
Abiathar
brought
the
ephod
to
David
8
David
inquired
of
Jehovah
Should
I
chase
after
this
marauder
band
Will
I
overtake
them
At
this
He
said
to
him
Go
in
pursuit
for
you
will
certainly
overtake
them
and
you
will
make
the
rescue
9
David
immediately
set
out
with
the
600
men
who
were
with
him
and
they
went
on
as
far
as
the
Wadi
Besor
where
some
of
the
men
stayed
behind
10
David
kept
up
the
chase
with
400
men
but
the
200
men
who
were
too
tired
to
cross
the
Wadi
Besor
stayed
behind
11
They
found
an
Egyptian
man
in
the
field
and
took
him
to
David
They
gave
him
food
to
eat
and
water
to
drink
12
as
well
as
a
slice
of
a
cake
of
pressed
figs
and
two
cakes
of
raisins
After
he
ate
he
regained
his
strength
for
he
had
not
eaten
any
food
or
drunk
any
water
for
three
days
and
three
nights
13
David
now
asked
him
To
whom
do
you
belong
and
where
are
you
from
to
which
he
said
I
am
an
Egyptian
attendant
a
slave
of
an
Amalekite
man
but
my
master
left
me
because
I
got
sick
three
days
ago
14
We
made
a
raid
on
the
south
of
the
Cherethites
and
on
the
territory
of
Judah
and
on
the
south
of
Caleb
and
Ziklag
we
burned
with
fire
15
At
this
David
said
to
him
Will
you
lead
me
down
to
this
marauder
band
He
replied
If
you
swear
to
me
by
God
that
you
will
not
put
me
to
death
and
that
you
will
not
hand
me
over
to
my
master
I
will
lead
you
down
to
this
marauder
band
16
So
he
led
him
down
to
where
they
were
spread
out
all
over
the
land
eating
and
drinking
and
celebrating
because
of
all
the
great
spoil
that
they
had
taken
from
the
land
of
the
Philistines
and
the
land
of
Judah
17
Then
David
struck
them
down
from
the
morning
darkness
until
the
following
evening
not
a
man
escaped
except
400
men
who
fled
on
camels
18
David
recovered
all
that
the
Amalekites
had
taken
and
David
rescued
his
two
wives
19
Nothing
of
theirs
was
missing
from
the
smallest
to
the
greatest
They
recovered
their
sons
and
daughters
and
the
spoil
David
recovered
everything
that
they
had
taken
20
So
David
took
all
the
flocks
and
the
herds
which
they
drove
before
their
own
livestock
They
said
This
is
Davids
spoil
21
Then
David
came
to
the
200
men
who
had
been
too
tired
to
go
along
with
David
and
who
had
stayed
behind
by
the
Wadi
Besor
and
they
came
out
to
meet
David
and
the
people
with
him
When
David
came
near
to
the
men
he
asked
them
how
they
were
22
However
every
bad
and
worthless
man
among
those
who
had
gone
with
David
said
Since
they
did
not
go
with
us
we
will
not
give
them
any
of
the
spoil
that
we
recovered
except
that
each
one
may
take
his
wife
and
his
sons
and
go
away
23
But
David
said
You
must
not
do
this
my
brothers
with
what
Jehovah
has
given
us
He
protected
us
and
gave
into
our
hand
the
marauder
band
that
came
against
us
24
Who
would
agree
with
you
on
this
The
share
of
the
one
who
went
down
into
the
battle
will
be
the
same
as
the
share
of
the
one
who
sat
by
the
baggage
All
will
have
a
share
together
25
And
from
that
day
forward
he
kept
it
set
as
a
regulation
and
a
rule
for
Israel
down
to
this
day
26
When
David
returned
to
Ziklag
he
sent
some
of
the
spoil
to
the
elders
of
Judah
who
were
his
friends
saying
Here
is
a
gift
for
you
from
the
spoil
of
Jehovahs
enemies
27
He
sent
it
to
those
who
were
in
Bethel
to
those
in
Ramoth
of
the
Negeb
to
those
in
Jattir
28
to
those
in
Aroer
to
those
in
Siphmoth
to
those
in
Eshtemoa
29
to
those
in
Racal
to
those
in
the
cities
of
the
Jerahmeelites
to
those
in
the
cities
of
the
Kenites
30
to
those
in
Hormah
to
those
in
Borashan
to
those
in
Athach
31
to
those
in
Hebron
and
to
all
the
places
that
David
and
his
men
had
frequented
1
Now
the
Philistines
were
fighting
against
Israel
And
the
men
of
Israel
fled
from
before
the
Philistines
and
many
fell
slain
on
Mount
Gilboa
2
The
Philistines
kept
in
close
range
of
Saul
and
his
sons
and
the
Philistines
struck
down
Jonathan
Abinadab
and
Malchi-shua
Sauls
sons
3
The
fighting
grew
fierce
against
Saul
and
the
archers
found
him
and
he
was
severely
wounded
by
the
archers
4
Then
Saul
said
to
his
armor-bearer
Draw
your
sword
and
run
me
through
with
it
so
that
these
uncircumcised
men
may
not
come
and
run
me
through
and
deal
ruthlessly
with
me
But
his
armor-bearer
was
unwilling
because
he
was
very
much
afraid
So
Saul
took
the
sword
and
fell
on
it
5
When
his
armor-bearer
saw
that
Saul
was
dead
he
too
fell
on
his
own
sword
and
died
with
him
6
Thus
Saul
his
three
sons
his
armor-bearer
and
all
his
men
died
together
on
that
day
7
When
the
people
of
Israel
who
were
in
the
region
of
the
valley
and
in
the
region
of
the
Jordan
saw
that
the
men
of
Israel
had
fled
and
that
Saul
and
his
sons
had
died
they
began
to
abandon
the
cities
and
flee
the
Philistines
then
came
and
occupied
them
8
The
next
day
when
the
Philistines
came
to
strip
the
slain
they
found
Saul
and
his
three
sons
fallen
on
Mount
Gilboa
9
So
they
cut
off
his
head
and
stripped
off
his
armor
and
sent
word
throughout
the
land
of
the
Philistines
to
spread
the
news
in
the
houses
of
their
idols
and
among
the
people
10
Then
they
put
his
armor
in
the
house
of
the
Ashtoreth
images
and
fastened
his
corpse
to
the
wall
of
Beth-shan
11
When
the
inhabitants
of
Jabesh-gilead
heard
what
the
Philistines
had
done
to
Saul
12
all
the
warriors
rose
and
traveled
all
night
and
took
the
bodies
of
Saul
and
his
sons
off
the
wall
of
Beth-shan
They
returned
to
Jabesh
and
burned
them
there
13
Then
they
took
their
bones
and
buried
them
under
the
tamarisk
tree
in
Jabesh
and
they
fasted
for
seven
days
1
After
Sauls
death
when
David
had
returned
from
defeating
the
Amalekites
David
stayed
at
Ziklag
for
two
days
2
On
the
third
day
a
man
came
from
the
camp
of
Saul
with
his
garments
ripped
apart
and
dirt
on
his
head
When
he
approached
David
he
fell
down
to
the
ground
and
prostrated
himself
3
David
asked
him
Where
are
you
coming
from
He
replied
I
have
escaped
from
the
camp
of
Israel
4
David
asked
him
How
did
things
turn
out
Please
tell
me
To
this
he
said
The
people
have
fled
from
the
battle
and
many
have
fallen
and
died
Even
Saul
and
his
son
Jonathan
have
died
5
Then
David
asked
the
young
man
who
brought
him
the
news
How
do
you
know
that
Saul
and
his
son
Jonathan
are
dead
6
The
young
man
replied
By
chance
I
was
on
Mount
Gilboa
and
there
was
Saul
supporting
himself
on
his
spear
and
the
chariots
and
horsemen
had
caught
up
with
him
7
When
he
turned
around
and
saw
me
he
called
me
and
I
said
Here
I
am
8
He
asked
me
Who
are
you
I
replied
I
am
an
Amalekite
9
Then
he
said
Please
stand
over
me
and
put
me
to
death
for
I
am
in
great
agony
but
I
am
still
alive
10
So
I
stood
over
him
and
put
him
to
death
for
I
knew
that
he
could
not
survive
after
he
had
fallen
down
wounded
Then
I
took
the
crown
that
was
on
his
head
and
the
bracelet
that
was
on
his
arm
and
I
brought
them
here
to
my
lord
11
At
this
David
took
hold
of
his
garments
and
ripped
them
apart
and
so
did
all
the
men
who
were
with
him
12
And
they
wailed
and
wept
and
fasted
until
evening
for
Saul
for
his
son
Jonathan
for
the
people
of
Jehovah
and
for
the
house
of
Israel
because
they
had
fallen
by
the
sword
13
David
asked
the
young
man
who
brought
him
the
news
Where
are
you
from
He
said
I
am
the
son
of
a
foreign
resident
an
Amalekite
14
Then
David
said
to
him
Why
did
you
not
fear
to
lift
your
hand
to
do
away
with
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
15
With
that
David
called
one
of
the
young
men
and
said
Step
forward
and
strike
him
So
he
struck
him
down
and
he
died
16
David
said
to
him
Your
blood
is
on
your
own
head
because
your
own
mouth
testified
against
you
by
saying
I
myself
put
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
to
death
17
Then
David
chanted
this
dirge
over
Saul
and
his
son
Jonathan
18
and
said
that
the
people
of
Judah
should
be
taught
the
dirge
called
The
Bow

which
is
written
in
the
book
of
Jashar
19
The
beauty
O
Israel
lies
slain
upon
your
high
places
How
the
mighty
have
fallen
20
Do
not
tell
it
in
Gath
Do
not
announce
it
in
the
streets
of
Ashkelon
Or
the
daughters
of
the
Philistines
will
rejoice
Or
the
daughters
of
the
uncircumcised
men
will
exult
21
You
mountains
of
Gilboa
May
there
be
no
dew
or
rain
upon
you
Nor
fields
producing
holy
contributions
Because
there
the
shield
of
mighty
ones
was
defiled
The
shield
of
Saul
is
no
longer
anointed
with
oil
22
From
the
blood
of
the
slain
from
the
fat
of
mighty
ones
The
bow
of
Jonathan
did
not
turn
back
And
the
sword
of
Saul
would
not
return
without
success
23
Saul
and
Jonathan
beloved
and
cherished
during
their
life
And
in
death
they
were
not
separated
Swifter
than
the
eagles
they
were
Mightier
than
the
lions
24
O
daughters
of
Israel
weep
over
Saul
Who
clothed
you
in
scarlet
and
finery
Who
put
gold
ornaments
upon
your
clothing
25
How
the
mighty
have
fallen
in
battle
Jonathan
lies
slain
upon
your
high
places
26
I
am
distressed
over
you
my
brother
Jonathan
You
were
very
dear
to
me
More
wonderful
was
your
love
to
me
than
the
love
of
women
27
How
the
mighty
have
fallenAnd
the
weapons
of
war
have
perished
1
Afterward
David
inquired
of
Jehovah
saying
Should
I
go
up
into
one
of
the
cities
of
Judah
Jehovah
said
to
him
Go
up
David
then
asked
Where
should
I
go
He
replied
To
Hebron
2
So
David
went
up
there
with
his
two
wives
Ahinoam
of
Jezreel
and
Abigail
the
widow
of
Nabal
the
Carmelite
3
David
also
brought
the
men
who
were
with
him
each
with
his
household
and
they
settled
in
the
cities
around
Hebron
4
Then
the
men
of
Judah
came
and
there
they
anointed
David
as
king
over
the
house
of
Judah
They
told
David
The
men
of
Jabesh-gilead
were
the
ones
who
buried
Saul
5
So
David
sent
messengers
to
the
men
of
Jabesh-gilead
and
said
to
them
May
you
be
blessed
by
Jehovah
because
you
showed
loyal
love
to
your
lord
Saul
by
burying
him
6
May
Jehovah
show
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
to
you
I
will
also
show
you
kindness
because
you
have
done
this
7
Now
let
your
hands
be
strong
and
be
courageous
men
for
your
lord
Saul
is
dead
and
the
house
of
Judah
has
anointed
me
as
king
over
them
8
But
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
the
chief
of
Sauls
army
had
taken
Sauls
son
Ish-bosheth
and
brought
him
across
to
Mahanaim
9
and
made
him
king
over
Gilead
the
Ashurites
Jezreel
Ephraim
Benjamin
and
over
all
Israel
10
Ish-bosheth
Sauls
son
was
40
years
old
when
he
became
king
over
Israel
and
he
reigned
for
two
years
The
house
of
Judah
however
supported
David
11
The
time
that
David
was
king
in
Hebron
over
the
house
of
Judah
was
seven
years
and
six
months
12
In
time
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
and
the
servants
of
Ish-bosheth
Sauls
son
went
out
from
Mahanaim
to
Gibeon
13
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
and
the
servants
of
David
also
went
out
and
encountered
them
at
the
pool
of
Gibeon
and
one
group
sat
on
this
side
of
the
pool
and
the
other
group
on
that
side
of
the
pool
14
Finally
Abner
said
to
Joab
Let
the
young
men
get
up
and
engage
in
combat
before
us
To
this
Joab
said
Let
them
get
up
15
So
they
got
up
and
crossed
over
by
number
12
for
Benjamin
and
Sauls
son
Ish-bosheth
and
12
from
the
servants
of
David
16
They
grabbed
one
another
by
the
head
and
each
of
them
thrust
his
sword
into
the
side
of
his
opponent
and
they
all
fell
down
together
So
that
place
which
is
in
Gibeon
was
called
Helkath-hazzurim
17
The
fighting
that
ensued
was
extremely
fierce
that
day
and
Abner
and
the
men
of
Israel
were
finally
defeated
before
the
servants
of
David
18
Now
the
three
sons
of
Zeruiah
were
there—Joab
Abishai
and
Asahel
and
Asahel
was
as
swift
on
his
feet
as
a
gazelle
in
the
open
field
19
Asahel
chased
after
Abner
and
he
would
not
veer
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
in
his
pursuit
of
Abner
20
When
Abner
looked
behind
he
asked
Is
that
you
Asahel
to
which
he
replied
Yes
it
is
21
Then
Abner
said
to
him
Veer
to
your
right
or
to
your
left
and
capture
one
of
the
young
men
and
take
whatever
you
strip
off
him
for
yourself
But
Asahel
did
not
want
to
stop
chasing
him
22
So
Abner
said
to
Asahel
once
again
Stop
chasing
me
Why
should
I
strike
you
down
How
could
I
look
your
brother
Joab
in
the
face
23
But
he
kept
refusing
to
stop
so
Abner
struck
him
in
the
abdomen
with
the
butt
end
of
the
spear
and
the
spear
came
out
from
his
back
and
he
fell
there
and
died
on
the
spot
Everyone
who
came
to
the
place
where
Asahel
fell
and
died
would
stop
and
pause
there
24
Then
Joab
and
Abishai
went
in
pursuit
of
Abner
As
the
sun
was
setting
they
came
to
the
hill
of
Ammah
which
faces
Giah
on
the
way
to
the
wilderness
of
Gibeon
25
There
the
Benjaminites
gathered
together
behind
Abner
and
they
formed
one
company
and
made
a
stand
on
the
top
of
a
certain
hill
26
Then
Abner
called
out
to
Joab
Is
the
sword
going
to
devour
endlessly
Do
you
not
know
that
the
outcome
will
only
be
bitterness
How
long
then
will
it
be
before
you
tell
the
people
to
turn
back
from
pursuing
their
brothers
27
At
that
Joab
said
As
surely
as
the
true
God
is
living
if
you
had
not
spoken
then
only
by
the
morning
would
the
people
have
stopped
pursuing
their
brothers
28
Joab
now
blew
the
horn
and
his
men
stopped
chasing
after
Israel
and
the
fighting
ceased
29
Abner
and
his
men
then
marched
through
the
Arabah
all
that
night
and
crossed
the
Jordan
and
marched
through
the
entire
ravine
and
finally
came
to
Mahanaim
30
After
Joab
turned
back
from
pursuing
Abner
he
gathered
all
the
people
together
Of
Davids
servants
19
were
missing
in
addition
to
Asahel
31
But
the
servants
of
David
had
defeated
the
Benjaminites
and
the
men
of
Abner
and
360
of
their
men
had
died
32
They
took
Asahel
and
buried
him
in
his
fathers
tomb
which
is
at
Bethlehem
Then
Joab
and
his
men
marched
all
night
long
and
they
reached
Hebron
at
daybreak
1
The
war
between
the
house
of
Saul
and
the
house
of
David
dragged
on
and
David
kept
getting
stronger
and
the
house
of
Saul
grew
steadily
weaker
2
Meanwhile
sons
were
born
to
David
in
Hebron
His
firstborn
was
Amnon
by
Ahinoam
of
Jezreel
3
His
second
was
Chileab
by
Abigail
the
widow
of
Nabal
the
Carmelite
and
the
third
was
Absalom
the
son
of
Maacah
the
daughter
of
Talmai
the
king
of
Geshur
4
The
fourth
was
Adonijah
the
son
of
Haggith
and
the
fifth
was
Shephatiah
the
son
of
Abital
5
The
sixth
was
Ithream
by
Davids
wife
Eglah
These
were
born
to
David
in
Hebron
6
While
the
war
between
the
house
of
Saul
and
the
house
of
David
continued
Abner
kept
strengthening
his
position
in
the
house
of
Saul
7
Now
Saul
had
had
a
concubine
whose
name
was
Rizpah
the
daughter
of
Aiah
Ish-bosheth
later
said
to
Abner
Why
did
you
have
relations
with
the
concubine
of
my
father
8
Abner
grew
very
angry
over
the
words
of
Ish-bosheth
and
said
Am
I
a
dogs
head
from
Judah
Until
this
very
day
I
have
shown
loyal
love
toward
the
house
of
your
father
Saul
and
to
his
brothers
and
his
friends
and
I
have
not
betrayed
you
into
the
hand
of
David
yet
today
you
call
me
to
account
for
an
error
concerning
a
woman
9
May
God
do
so
to
Abner
and
add
to
it
if
I
do
not
do
for
David
just
as
Jehovah
swore
to
him
10
to
transfer
the
kingdom
from
the
house
of
Saul
and
to
establish
the
throne
of
David
over
Israel
and
over
Judah
from
Dan
to
Beer-sheba
11
He
was
not
able
to
say
one
more
word
in
reply
to
Abner
for
he
was
afraid
of
him
12
Abner
immediately
sent
messengers
to
David
saying
To
whom
does
the
land
belong
He
added
Make
a
covenant
with
me
and
I
will
do
whatever
I
can
to
turn
all
Israel
to
your
side
13
To
this
he
replied
Good
I
will
make
a
covenant
with
you
The
only
thing
I
ask
of
you
is
that
you
do
not
try
to
see
my
face
unless
first
you
bring
Michal
Sauls
daughter
when
you
come
to
see
me
14
Then
David
sent
messengers
to
Ish-bosheth
Sauls
son
saying
Give
me
my
wife
Michal
to
whom
I
became
engaged
for
100
foreskins
of
the
Philistines
15
So
Ish-bosheth
sent
to
take
her
from
her
husband
Paltiel
the
son
of
Laish
16
But
her
husband
kept
walking
with
her
weeping
as
he
followed
her
as
far
as
Bahurim
Then
Abner
said
to
him
Go
return
At
that
he
returned
17
Meanwhile
Abner
sent
word
to
the
elders
of
Israel
saying
For
some
time
you
wanted
to
have
David
as
king
over
you
18
Now
act
for
Jehovah
said
to
David
By
the
hand
of
my
servant
David
I
will
save
my
people
Israel
from
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
and
from
the
hand
of
all
their
enemies
19
Then
Abner
spoke
to
the
people
of
Benjamin
Abner
also
went
to
speak
privately
to
David
at
Hebron
to
tell
him
what
Israel
and
the
whole
house
of
Benjamin
had
agreed
upon
20
When
Abner
came
to
David
at
Hebron
with
20
men
David
held
a
feast
for
Abner
and
for
the
men
with
him
21
Then
Abner
said
to
David
Let
me
go
and
gather
all
Israel
together
to
my
lord
the
king
so
that
they
may
make
a
covenant
with
you
and
you
will
become
king
over
all
that
you
desire
So
David
sent
Abner
off
and
he
went
his
way
in
peace
22
Just
then
Davids
servants
and
Joab
returned
from
a
raid
bringing
a
great
quantity
of
spoil
back
with
them
Abner
was
no
longer
with
David
in
Hebron
for
he
had
sent
him
on
his
way
in
peace
23
When
Joab
and
all
the
army
that
was
with
him
arrived
Joab
was
told
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
came
to
the
king
and
he
sent
him
off
and
he
went
his
way
in
peace
24
So
Joab
went
in
to
the
king
and
said
What
have
you
done
Here
Abner
came
to
you
Why
did
you
send
him
off
so
that
he
successfully
got
away
25
You
know
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
He
came
here
to
fool
you
and
to
get
to
know
your
every
move
and
to
find
out
everything
that
you
are
doing
26
So
Joab
left
David
and
sent
messengers
after
Abner
and
they
brought
him
back
from
the
cistern
of
Sirah
but
David
did
not
know
anything
about
it
27
When
Abner
returned
to
Hebron
Joab
took
him
aside
inside
the
gate
to
speak
with
him
privately
However
there
he
stabbed
him
in
the
abdomen
and
he
died
this
was
for
killing
his
brother
Asahel
28
When
David
heard
about
it
later
he
said
I
and
my
kingdom
are
forever
innocent
before
Jehovah
of
the
bloodguilt
for
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
29
May
it
turn
back
on
the
head
of
Joab
and
on
the
entire
house
of
his
father
May
Joabs
house
never
be
without
a
man
suffering
from
a
discharge
or
a
leper
or
a
man
working
at
the
spindle
or
one
falling
by
the
sword
or
one
in
need
of
food
30
So
Joab
and
his
brother
Abishai
killed
Abner
because
he
had
put
Asahel
their
brother
to
death
in
the
battle
at
Gibeon
31
Then
David
said
to
Joab
and
all
the
people
with
him
Rip
your
garments
apart
and
tie
on
sackcloth
and
wail
over
Abner
King
David
himself
was
walking
behind
the
funeral
bier
32
They
buried
Abner
in
Hebron
and
the
king
wept
loudly
at
Abners
tomb
and
all
the
people
gave
way
to
weeping
33
The
king
chanted
over
Abner
and
said
Should
Abner
die
the
death
of
a
senseless
person
34
Your
hands
had
not
been
bound
And
your
feet
were
not
in
fetters
You
fell
like
one
falling
before
criminals
At
that
all
the
people
wept
over
him
again
35
Later
all
the
people
came
to
give
David
bread
for
consolation
while
it
was
still
daytime
but
David
swore
May
God
do
so
to
me
and
add
to
it
if
before
the
sun
sets
I
taste
bread
or
anything
at
all
36
All
the
people
took
notice
and
it
pleased
them
Like
everything
that
the
king
did
it
pleased
all
the
people
37
So
all
the
people
and
all
Israel
knew
on
that
day
that
the
king
was
not
responsible
for
having
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
put
to
death
38
Then
the
king
said
to
his
servants
Do
you
not
know
that
a
prince
and
a
great
man
has
fallen
this
day
in
Israel
39
Today
I
am
weak
although
anointed
as
king
and
these
men
the
sons
of
Zeruiah
are
too
brutal
for
me
May
Jehovah
repay
the
evildoer
according
to
his
own
evil
1
When
Sauls
son
Ish-bosheth
heard
that
Abner
had
died
in
Hebron
his
courage
failed
him
and
all
the
Israelites
were
disturbed
2
There
were
two
men
in
charge
of
the
marauder
bands
that
belonged
to
the
son
of
Saul
one
was
named
Baanah
and
the
other
Rechab
They
were
sons
of
Rimmon
the
Beerothite
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
For
Beeroth
too
used
to
be
counted
as
part
of
Benjamin
3
The
Beerothites
ran
away
to
Gittaim
and
they
are
foreign
residents
there
down
to
this
day
4
Now
Sauls
son
Jonathan
had
a
son
whose
feet
were
crippled
He
was
five
years
old
when
the
report
about
Saul
and
Jonathan
came
from
Jezreel
and
his
nurse
picked
him
up
and
fled
but
as
she
was
fleeing
in
panic
he
fell
and
was
crippled
His
name
was
Mephibosheth
5
The
sons
of
Rimmon
the
Beerothite
Rechab
and
Baanah
went
to
the
house
of
Ish-bosheth
during
the
hot
part
of
the
day
as
he
was
taking
his
midday
rest
6
They
went
into
the
house
as
if
they
were
getting
wheat
and
they
struck
him
in
the
abdomen
then
Rechab
and
his
brother
Baanah
escaped
7
When
they
had
entered
the
house
he
was
lying
on
his
bed
in
his
bedroom
and
they
struck
him
and
put
him
to
death
after
which
they
cut
off
his
head
Then
they
took
his
head
and
walked
all
night
long
on
the
road
to
the
Arabah
8
And
they
brought
the
head
of
Ish-bosheth
to
David
at
Hebron
and
said
to
the
king
Here
is
the
head
of
Ish-bosheth
the
son
of
Saul
your
enemy
who
sought
your
life
This
day
Jehovah
gives
to
my
lord
the
king
revenge
on
Saul
and
his
descendants
9
However
David
answered
Rechab
and
his
brother
Baanah
the
sons
of
Rimmon
the
Beerothite
and
said
to
them
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
the
one
who
rescued
me
out
of
all
distress
10
when
someone
reported
to
me
Here
Saul
is
dead

and
he
thought
he
was
bringing
me
good
news
I
took
hold
of
him
and
killed
him
in
Ziklag
That
was
the
messengers
reward
he
received
from
me
11
How
much
more
so
when
wicked
men
have
killed
a
righteous
man
in
his
own
house
on
his
bed
Should
I
not
require
his
blood
from
your
hands
and
rid
the
earth
of
you
12
David
then
ordered
the
young
men
to
kill
them
They
cut
off
their
hands
and
feet
and
hung
them
by
the
pool
in
Hebron
But
they
took
the
head
of
Ish-bosheth
and
buried
it
in
the
burial
place
of
Abner
in
Hebron
1
In
time
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
came
to
David
at
Hebron
and
said
Look
We
are
your
own
bone
and
flesh
2
In
times
past
while
Saul
was
our
king
you
were
the
one
who
was
leading
Israel
on
its
campaigns
And
Jehovah
said
to
you
You
will
shepherd
my
people
Israel
and
you
will
become
leader
over
Israel
3
So
all
the
elders
of
Israel
came
to
the
king
at
Hebron
and
King
David
made
a
covenant
with
them
in
Hebron
before
Jehovah
Then
they
anointed
David
as
king
over
Israel
4
David
was
30
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
40
years
5
In
Hebron
he
reigned
over
Judah
for
7
years
and
6
months
and
in
Jerusalem
he
reigned
for
33
years
over
all
Israel
and
Judah
6
And
the
king
and
his
men
set
out
for
Jerusalem
against
the
Jebusites
who
were
inhabiting
the
land
They
taunted
David
You
will
never
come
in
here
Even
the
blind
and
the
lame
will
drive
you
away
They
thought
David
will
never
get
in
here
7
However
David
captured
the
stronghold
of
Zion
which
is
now
the
City
of
David
8
So
David
said
on
that
day
Those
who
attack
the
Jebusites
should
go
through
the
water
tunnel
to
strike
down
both
the
lame
and
the
blind

who
are
hateful
to
David
That
is
why
it
is
said
The
blind
and
the
lame
will
never
enter
the
house
9
Then
David
took
up
residence
in
the
stronghold
and
it
was
called
the
City
of
David
and
David
began
to
build
all
around
from
the
Mound
inward
10
Thus
David
became
greater
and
greater
and
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
was
with
him
11
King
Hiram
of
Tyre
sent
messengers
to
David
also
cedar
timbers
woodworkers
and
stonemasons
for
building
walls
and
they
began
to
build
a
house
for
David
12
And
David
knew
that
Jehovah
had
firmly
established
him
as
king
over
Israel
and
had
exalted
his
kingdom
for
the
sake
of
His
people
Israel
13
David
took
more
concubines
and
wives
in
Jerusalem
after
he
came
from
Hebron
and
more
sons
and
daughters
were
born
to
David
14
These
are
the
names
of
those
born
to
him
in
Jerusalem
Shammua
Shobab
Nathan
Solomon
15
Ibhar
Elishua
Nepheg
Japhia
16
Elishama
Eliada
and
Eliphelet
17
When
the
Philistines
heard
that
David
had
been
anointed
as
king
over
Israel
all
the
Philistines
came
up
to
search
for
David
When
David
heard
about
it
he
went
down
to
the
stronghold
18
Then
the
Philistines
came
in
and
spread
out
in
the
Valley
of
Rephaim
19
David
inquired
of
Jehovah
saying
Should
I
go
up
against
the
Philistines
Will
you
give
them
into
my
hand
At
this
Jehovah
said
to
David
Go
up
for
I
will
surely
give
the
Philistines
into
your
hand
20
So
David
came
to
Baal-perazim
and
David
struck
them
down
there
At
that
he
said
Jehovah
has
broken
through
my
enemies
before
me
like
a
breach
made
by
waters
That
is
why
he
named
that
place
Baal-perazim
21
The
Philistines
abandoned
their
idols
there
and
David
and
his
men
took
them
away
22
Later
the
Philistines
came
up
once
again
and
spread
out
in
the
Valley
of
Rephaim
23
David
inquired
of
Jehovah
but
He
said
Do
not
go
directly
up
Instead
go
around
behind
them
and
come
against
them
in
front
of
the
baca
bushes
24
And
when
you
hear
the
sound
of
marching
in
the
tops
of
the
baca
bushes
then
act
decisively
for
Jehovah
will
have
gone
out
before
you
to
strike
down
the
army
of
the
Philistines
25
So
David
did
just
as
Jehovah
commanded
him
and
he
struck
down
the
Philistines
from
Geba
all
the
way
to
Gezer
1
David
again
gathered
all
the
best
troops
in
Israel
30000
men
2
Then
David
and
all
the
men
with
him
set
out
for
Baale-judah
to
bring
up
from
there
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
before
which
people
call
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
of
armies
who
sits
enthroned
above
the
cherubs
3
However
they
placed
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
on
a
new
wagon
to
transport
it
from
the
house
of
Abinadab
which
was
on
the
hill
and
Uzzah
and
Ahio
the
sons
of
Abinadab
were
leading
the
new
wagon
4
So
they
transported
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
from
Abinadabs
house
on
the
hill
and
Ahio
was
walking
ahead
of
the
Ark
5
David
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
were
celebrating
before
Jehovah
with
all
sorts
of
juniper-wood
instruments
harps
other
stringed
instruments
tambourines
sistrums
and
cymbals
6
But
when
they
came
to
the
threshing
floor
of
Nacon
Uzzah
thrust
his
hand
out
to
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
and
grabbed
hold
of
it
for
the
cattle
nearly
upset
it
7
At
that
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
Uzzah
and
the
true
God
struck
him
down
there
for
his
irreverent
act
and
he
died
there
beside
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
8
But
David
became
angry
because
Jehovahs
wrath
had
broken
through
against
Uzzah
and
that
place
has
been
called
Perez-uzzah
down
to
this
day
9
So
David
became
fearful
of
Jehovah
on
that
day
and
said
How
can
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
come
to
me
10
David
was
not
willing
to
bring
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
to
where
he
was
in
the
City
of
David
Instead
David
had
it
taken
to
the
house
of
Obed-edom
the
Gittite
11
The
Ark
of
Jehovah
remained
at
the
house
of
Obed-edom
the
Gittite
for
three
months
and
Jehovah
kept
blessing
Obed-edom
and
all
his
household
12
The
report
was
made
to
King
David
Jehovah
has
blessed
the
house
of
Obed-edom
and
all
that
belongs
to
him
because
of
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
So
David
went
to
bring
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
from
the
house
of
Obed-edom
up
to
the
City
of
David
with
rejoicing
13
When
the
carriers
of
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
had
marched
six
steps
he
sacrificed
a
bull
and
a
fattened
animal
14
David
was
dancing
around
before
Jehovah
with
all
his
might
all
the
while
David
wore
a
linen
ephod
15
David
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
were
bringing
up
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
with
joyful
shouting
and
with
the
sound
of
the
horn
16
But
when
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
came
into
the
City
of
David
Sauls
daughter
Michal
looked
down
through
the
window
and
saw
King
David
leaping
and
dancing
around
before
Jehovah
and
she
began
to
despise
him
in
her
heart
17
So
they
brought
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
in
and
set
it
in
its
place
inside
the
tent
that
David
had
pitched
for
it
Then
David
offered
up
burnt
offerings
and
communion
sacrifices
before
Jehovah
18
When
David
finished
offering
up
the
burnt
offerings
and
the
communion
sacrifices
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
of
armies
19
Further
he
distributed
to
all
the
people
to
the
whole
multitude
of
Israel
to
each
man
and
woman
a
ring-shaped
loaf
of
bread
a
date
cake
and
a
raisin
cake
and
then
all
the
people
left
each
to
his
own
house
20
When
David
returned
to
bless
his
own
household
Sauls
daughter
Michal
came
out
to
meet
him
She
said
How
glorious
the
king
of
Israel
made
himself
when
he
uncovered
himself
today
before
the
eyes
of
the
slave
girls
of
his
servants
just
as
an
empty-headed
man
openly
uncovers
himself
21
At
this
David
said
to
Michal
My
celebration
was
before
Jehovah
who
chose
me
rather
than
your
father
and
all
his
household
and
who
appointed
me
as
leader
over
Jehovahs
people
Israel
Therefore
I
will
celebrate
before
Jehovah
22
and
I
will
humble
myself
even
more
than
this
and
become
low
even
in
my
own
eyes
But
by
the
slave
girls
whom
you
mentioned
I
will
be
glorified
23
So
Sauls
daughter
Michal
had
no
children
down
to
the
day
of
her
death
1
When
the
king
was
settled
in
his
own
house
and
Jehovah
had
given
him
rest
from
all
his
surrounding
enemies
2
the
king
said
to
Nathan
the
prophet
Here
I
am
living
in
a
house
of
cedars
while
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
sits
in
the
midst
of
tent
cloths
3
Nathan
replied
to
the
king
Go
and
do
whatever
is
in
your
heart
for
Jehovah
is
with
you
4
On
that
very
night
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Nathan
saying
5
Go
and
say
to
my
servant
David
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Should
you
build
me
a
house
to
dwell
in
6
For
I
have
not
dwelled
in
a
house
from
the
day
I
brought
the
people
of
Israel
out
of
Egypt
to
this
day
but
I
have
been
moving
about
in
a
tent
and
in
a
tabernacle
7
During
all
the
time
that
I
went
with
all
the
Israelites
did
I
ever
say
one
word
to
any
of
the
tribal
leaders
of
Israel
whom
I
appointed
to
shepherd
my
people
Israel
saying
Why
did
you
not
build
a
house
of
cedars
for
me
8
Now
say
this
to
my
servant
David
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
I
took
you
from
the
pastures
from
following
the
flock
to
become
a
leader
over
my
people
Israel
9
And
I
will
be
with
you
wherever
you
go
and
I
will
do
away
with
all
your
enemies
from
before
you
and
I
will
make
a
great
name
for
you
like
the
name
of
the
great
men
of
the
earth
10
I
will
appoint
a
place
for
my
people
Israel
and
settle
them
and
they
will
live
there
and
not
be
disturbed
anymore
and
wicked
men
will
not
oppress
them
again
as
they
did
in
the
past
11
from
the
day
that
I
appointed
judges
over
my
people
Israel
And
I
will
give
you
rest
from
all
your
enemies
Also
Jehovah
has
told
you
that
Jehovah
will
make
a
house
for
you
12
When
your
days
come
to
an
end
and
you
are
laid
to
rest
with
your
forefathers
then
I
will
raise
up
your
offspring
after
you
your
own
son
and
I
will
firmly
establish
his
kingdom
13
He
is
the
one
who
will
build
a
house
for
my
name
and
I
will
firmly
establish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
forever
14
I
will
become
his
father
and
he
will
become
my
son
When
he
does
wrong
I
will
reprove
him
with
the
rod
of
men
and
with
the
strokes
of
the
sons
of
men
15
My
loyal
love
will
not
be
taken
away
from
him
the
way
I
took
it
away
from
Saul
whom
I
removed
from
before
you
16
Your
house
and
your
kingdom
will
be
secure
forever
before
you
your
throne
will
be
firmly
established
forever
17
Nathan
told
David
all
these
words
and
this
entire
vision
18
At
that
King
David
came
in
and
sat
down
before
Jehovah
and
said
Who
am
I
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
And
what
is
my
house
that
you
have
brought
me
this
far
19
As
if
this
were
not
enough
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
you
also
speak
about
the
house
of
your
servant
down
to
a
distant
future
time
and
this
is
instruction
for
all
mankind
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
20
What
more
can
your
servant
David
say
to
you
when
you
know
me
so
well
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
21
For
the
sake
of
your
word
and
in
agreement
with
your
heart
you
have
done
all
these
great
things
and
have
revealed
them
to
your
servant
22
That
is
why
you
are
truly
great
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
There
is
no
one
like
you
and
there
is
no
God
except
you
everything
we
have
heard
with
our
ears
confirms
this
23
And
what
other
nation
on
earth
is
like
your
people
Israel
God
went
and
redeemed
them
as
his
people
making
a
name
for
himself
by
doing
great
and
awe-inspiring
things
for
them
You
drove
out
the
nations
and
their
gods
in
behalf
of
your
people
whom
you
redeemed
to
yourself
from
Egypt
24
You
established
your
people
Israel
as
your
own
people
for
all
time
and
you
O
Jehovah
have
become
their
God
25
Now
O
Jehovah
God
carry
out
the
promise
you
have
made
concerning
your
servant
and
his
house
for
all
time
and
may
you
do
just
as
you
have
promised
26
May
your
name
be
exalted
forever
so
that
people
may
say
Jehovah
of
armies
is
God
over
Israel

and
may
the
house
of
your
servant
David
be
firmly
established
before
you
27
For
you
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
have
made
a
revelation
to
your
servant
by
saying
I
will
build
a
house
for
you
That
is
why
your
servant
has
the
courage
to
pray
this
prayer
to
you
28
And
now
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
you
are
the
true
God
and
your
words
are
truth
and
you
have
promised
these
good
things
to
your
servant
29
So
may
it
please
you
to
bless
the
house
of
your
servant
and
may
it
continue
forever
before
you
for
you
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
have
promised
and
with
your
blessing
may
the
house
of
your
servant
be
blessed
forever
1
Some
time
later
David
defeated
the
Philistines
and
subdued
them
and
David
took
Metheg-ammah
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Philistines
2
He
defeated
the
Moabites
and
made
them
lie
down
on
the
ground
and
measured
them
with
a
line
He
measured
out
two
lines
to
be
put
to
death
and
one
full
line
to
be
kept
alive
And
the
Moabites
became
Davids
servants
and
brought
tribute
3
David
defeated
Hadadezer
the
son
of
Rehob
the
king
of
Zobah
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
restore
his
authority
at
the
Euphrates
River
4
David
captured
1700
horsemen
and
20000
foot
soldiers
from
him
Then
David
hamstrung
all
but
100
of
the
chariot
horses
5
When
the
Syrians
of
Damascus
came
to
help
King
Hadadezer
of
Zobah
David
struck
down
22000
of
the
Syrians
6
David
then
established
garrisons
in
Syria
of
Damascus
and
the
Syrians
became
Davids
servants
and
brought
tribute
Jehovah
gave
David
victory
wherever
he
went
7
Moreover
David
took
the
circular
shields
of
gold
from
the
servants
of
Hadadezer
and
brought
them
to
Jerusalem
8
From
Betah
and
Berothai
cities
of
Hadadezer
King
David
took
a
great
quantity
of
copper
9
Now
King
Toi
of
Hamath
heard
that
David
had
defeated
the
entire
army
of
Hadadezer
10
So
Toi
sent
his
son
Joram
to
King
David
to
ask
about
his
welfare
and
to
congratulate
him
because
he
had
fought
and
defeated
Hadadezer
for
Hadadezer
had
often
fought
against
Toi
and
he
brought
articles
of
silver
gold
and
copper
11
King
David
sanctified
these
to
Jehovah
along
with
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
he
had
sanctified
from
all
the
nations
that
he
had
subdued
12
from
Syria
and
Moab
from
the
Ammonites
the
Philistines
the
Amalekites
and
from
the
spoil
of
Hadadezer
the
son
of
Rehob
the
king
of
Zobah
13
David
also
made
a
name
for
himself
when
he
came
back
from
striking
down
18000
Edomites
in
the
Valley
of
Salt
14
He
established
garrisons
in
Edom
In
all
Edom
he
established
garrisons
and
all
the
Edomites
became
Davids
servants
Jehovah
gave
David
victory
wherever
he
went
15
David
kept
reigning
over
all
Israel
and
David
was
administering
justice
and
righteousness
for
all
his
people
16
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
was
over
the
army
and
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Ahilud
was
recorder
17
Zadok
the
son
of
Ahitub
and
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Abiathar
were
priests
and
Seraiah
was
secretary
18
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
over
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites
And
Davids
sons
became
chief
ministers
1
David
then
said
Is
there
anyone
still
left
of
the
house
of
Saul
to
whom
I
may
show
loyal
love
for
the
sake
of
Jonathan
2
Now
there
was
a
servant
of
the
house
of
Saul
named
Ziba
So
they
called
him
to
David
and
the
king
asked
him
Are
you
Ziba
He
replied
I
am
your
servant
3
The
king
continued
Is
there
anyone
left
of
the
house
of
Saul
to
whom
I
may
extend
Gods
loyal
love
Ziba
replied
to
the
king
There
is
still
one
son
of
Jonathan
he
is
crippled
in
both
feet
4
The
king
asked
him
Where
is
he
Ziba
replied
to
the
king
He
is
in
the
house
of
Machir
the
son
of
Ammiel
at
Lo-debar
5
King
David
immediately
sent
for
him
and
took
him
from
the
house
of
Machir
the
son
of
Ammiel
at
Lo-debar
6
When
Mephibosheth
the
son
of
Jonathan
the
son
of
Saul
came
in
to
David
he
at
once
fell
facedown
and
prostrated
himself
Then
David
said
Mephibosheth
to
which
he
replied
Here
is
your
servant
7
David
said
to
him
Do
not
be
afraid
for
I
will
certainly
show
loyal
love
to
you
for
the
sake
of
your
father
Jonathan
and
I
will
return
to
you
all
the
land
of
Saul
your
grandfather
and
you
will
always
dine
at
my
table
8
At
that
he
prostrated
himself
and
said
What
is
your
servant
that
you
have
turned
your
attention
to
a
dead
dog
like
me
9
The
king
now
sent
for
Ziba
Sauls
attendant
and
said
to
him
Everything
that
belonged
to
Saul
and
to
all
his
house
I
give
to
the
grandson
of
your
master
10
You
will
cultivate
the
land
for
him—you
and
your
sons
and
your
servants—and
you
will
gather
its
produce
to
provide
food
for
those
who
belong
to
the
grandson
of
your
master
to
eat
But
Mephibosheth
the
grandson
of
your
master
will
always
dine
at
my
table
Now
Ziba
had
15
sons
and
20
servants
11
Then
Ziba
said
to
the
king
Your
servant
will
do
all
that
my
lord
the
king
commands
his
servant
to
do
So
Mephibosheth
ate
at
Davids
table
like
one
of
the
sons
of
the
king
12
Now
Mephibosheth
also
had
a
young
son
named
Mica
and
all
those
who
lived
in
Zibas
house
became
servants
of
Mephibosheth
13
And
Mephibosheth
lived
in
Jerusalem
for
he
always
ate
at
the
table
of
the
king
and
he
was
crippled
in
both
feet
1
Later
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
died
and
his
son
Hanun
became
king
in
his
place
2
At
that
David
said
I
will
show
loyal
love
toward
Hanun
the
son
of
Nahash
as
his
father
showed
loyal
love
toward
me
So
David
sent
his
servants
to
offer
him
comfort
over
the
loss
of
his
father
But
when
Davids
servants
came
into
the
land
of
the
Ammonites
3
the
princes
of
the
Ammonites
said
to
Hanun
their
lord
Do
you
think
that
David
is
honoring
your
father
by
sending
comforters
to
you
Is
it
not
to
search
through
the
city
and
to
spy
it
out
and
to
overthrow
it
that
David
has
sent
his
servants
to
you
4
So
Hanun
took
the
servants
of
David
and
shaved
off
half
their
beards
and
cut
their
garments
in
half
at
their
buttocks
and
sent
them
away
5
When
David
was
told
he
at
once
sent
men
to
meet
them
because
the
men
had
been
deeply
humiliated
and
the
king
told
them
Stay
in
Jericho
until
your
beards
grow
back
and
then
return
6
In
time
the
Ammonites
saw
that
they
had
become
a
stench
to
David
so
the
Ammonites
sent
and
hired
Syrians
of
Beth-rehob
and
Syrians
of
Zobah
20000
foot
soldiers
and
the
king
of
Maacah
with
1000
men
and
from
Ishtob
12000
men
7
When
David
heard
about
it
he
sent
Joab
and
the
entire
army
including
his
mightiest
warriors
8
And
the
Ammonites
went
out
and
drew
up
in
battle
formation
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
gate
while
the
Syrians
of
Zobah
and
of
Rehob
along
with
Ishtob
and
Maacah
were
by
themselves
in
the
open
field
9
When
Joab
saw
that
the
battle
charges
were
coming
against
him
from
the
front
and
the
rear
he
chose
some
of
the
best
troops
in
Israel
and
drew
them
up
in
battle
formation
to
meet
the
Syrians
10
He
put
the
rest
of
the
men
under
the
command
of
his
brother
Abishai
in
order
to
draw
them
up
in
battle
formation
to
meet
the
Ammonites
11
Then
he
said
If
the
Syrians
become
too
strong
for
me
then
you
must
come
to
my
rescue
but
if
the
Ammonites
become
too
strong
for
you
I
will
come
to
your
rescue
12
We
must
be
strong
and
courageous
for
our
people
and
for
the
cities
of
our
God
and
Jehovah
will
do
what
is
good
in
his
eyes
13
Then
Joab
and
his
men
advanced
to
meet
the
Syrians
in
battle
and
they
fled
from
before
him
14
When
the
Ammonites
saw
that
the
Syrians
had
fled
they
fled
from
Abishai
and
went
into
the
city
After
that
Joab
returned
from
the
Ammonites
and
came
to
Jerusalem
15
When
the
Syrians
saw
that
they
had
been
defeated
by
Israel
they
regrouped
16
So
Hadadezer
sent
for
the
Syrians
in
the
region
of
the
River
and
then
they
came
to
Helam
with
Shobach
the
chief
of
the
army
of
Hadadezer
leading
them
17
When
the
report
was
made
to
David
he
immediately
gathered
all
Israel
and
crossed
the
Jordan
and
came
to
Helam
The
Syrians
then
drew
up
in
battle
formation
to
meet
David
and
fought
against
him
18
But
the
Syrians
fled
from
Israel
and
David
killed
700
charioteers
and
40000
horsemen
of
the
Syrians
and
he
struck
down
Shobach
the
chief
of
their
army
who
died
there
19
When
all
the
kings
the
servants
of
Hadadezer
saw
that
they
had
been
defeated
by
Israel
they
promptly
made
peace
with
Israel
and
became
their
subjects
and
the
Syrians
were
afraid
to
help
the
Ammonites
anymore
1
At
the
start
of
the
year
at
the
time
when
kings
go
on
campaigns
David
sent
Joab
and
his
servants
and
the
entire
army
of
Israel
to
bring
the
Ammonites
to
ruin
and
they
besieged
Rabbah
while
David
stayed
in
Jerusalem
2
One
evening
David
got
up
from
his
bed
and
walked
around
on
the
rooftop
of
the
kings
house
From
the
rooftop
he
saw
a
woman
bathing
and
the
woman
was
very
beautiful
3
David
sent
someone
to
inquire
about
the
woman
and
he
reported
Is
this
not
Bath-sheba
the
daughter
of
Eliam
and
the
wife
of
Uriah
the
Hittite
4
Then
David
sent
messengers
to
bring
her
So
she
came
in
to
him
and
he
lay
down
with
her
This
happened
while
she
was
purifying
herself
from
her
uncleanness
Afterward
she
returned
to
her
house
5
The
woman
became
pregnant
and
she
sent
a
message
to
David
I
am
pregnant
6
At
this
David
sent
a
message
to
Joab
Send
to
me
Uriah
the
Hittite
So
Joab
sent
Uriah
to
David
7
When
Uriah
came
to
him
David
asked
him
how
Joab
was
getting
along
how
the
troops
were
getting
along
and
how
the
war
was
going
8
David
then
said
to
Uriah
Go
down
to
your
house
and
relax
When
Uriah
left
the
kings
house
the
kings
courtesy
gift
was
sent
after
him
9
However
Uriah
slept
at
the
entrance
of
the
kings
house
with
all
the
other
servants
of
his
lord
and
he
did
not
go
down
to
his
own
house
10
So
David
was
told
Uriah
did
not
go
down
to
his
own
house
At
that
David
said
to
Uriah
Have
you
not
just
returned
from
a
journey
Why
did
you
not
go
down
to
your
own
house
11
Uriah
replied
to
David
The
Ark
and
Israel
and
Judah
are
dwelling
in
temporary
shelters
and
my
lord
Joab
and
the
servants
of
my
lord
are
camping
in
the
open
field
So
should
I
go
into
my
own
house
to
eat
and
drink
and
lie
down
with
my
wife
As
surely
as
you
live
and
are
alive
I
will
not
do
this
thing
12
Then
David
said
to
Uriah
Stay
here
also
today
and
tomorrow
I
will
send
you
away
So
Uriah
stayed
in
Jerusalem
on
that
day
and
the
following
day
13
David
then
sent
for
him
to
come
and
eat
and
drink
with
him
and
he
got
him
drunk
But
in
the
evening
he
went
out
to
sleep
on
his
bed
with
the
servants
of
his
lord
and
he
did
not
go
down
to
his
house
14
In
the
morning
David
wrote
a
letter
to
Joab
and
sent
it
by
the
hand
of
Uriah
15
He
wrote
in
the
letter
Put
Uriah
in
the
front
lines
where
the
fighting
is
fiercest
Then
retreat
from
behind
him
so
that
he
will
be
struck
down
and
die
16
Joab
had
been
carefully
watching
the
city
and
he
stationed
Uriah
where
he
knew
there
were
mighty
warriors
17
When
the
men
of
the
city
came
out
and
fought
against
Joab
some
of
Davids
servants
fell
and
Uriah
the
Hittite
was
among
those
who
died
18
Joab
now
reported
to
David
all
the
news
about
the
war
19
He
instructed
the
messenger
When
you
finish
speaking
to
the
king
about
all
the
news
of
the
war
20
the
king
may
become
angry
and
say
to
you
Why
did
you
have
to
go
so
near
to
the
city
to
fight
Did
you
not
know
that
they
would
shoot
from
the
top
of
the
wall
21
Who
struck
down
Abimelech
the
son
of
Jerubbesheth
Was
it
not
a
woman
who
threw
an
upper
millstone
on
him
from
the
top
of
the
wall
causing
his
death
at
Thebez
Why
did
you
have
to
go
so
close
to
the
wall
Then
say
Your
servant
Uriah
the
Hittite
also
died
22
So
the
messenger
went
and
told
David
everything
that
Joab
had
sent
him
to
tell
23
Then
the
messenger
told
David
Their
men
overpowered
us
and
they
came
out
against
us
in
the
field
but
we
drove
them
back
to
the
entrance
of
the
city
gate
24
And
the
archers
were
shooting
at
your
servants
from
the
top
of
the
wall
and
some
of
the
servants
of
the
king
died
your
servant
Uriah
the
Hittite
also
died
25
At
that
David
said
to
the
messenger
Say
this
to
Joab
Do
not
let
this
matter
trouble
you
for
the
sword
devours
one
as
well
as
another
Intensify
your
battle
against
the
city
and
conquer
it
And
encourage
him
26
When
Uriahs
wife
heard
that
her
husband
Uriah
had
died
she
began
to
mourn
her
husband
27
As
soon
as
the
mourning
period
was
over
David
sent
for
her
and
brought
her
to
his
house
and
she
became
his
wife
and
bore
him
a
son
But
what
David
had
done
was
very
displeasing
to
Jehovah
1
So
Jehovah
sent
Nathan
to
David
He
came
in
to
him
and
said
There
were
two
men
in
one
city
the
one
rich
and
the
other
poor
2
The
rich
man
had
very
many
sheep
and
cattle
3
but
the
poor
man
had
nothing
but
one
small
female
lamb
which
he
had
bought
He
cared
for
it
and
it
grew
up
together
with
him
and
his
sons
It
would
eat
from
the
little
food
he
had
and
drink
from
his
cup
and
sleep
in
his
arms
It
became
as
a
daughter
to
him
4
Later
a
visitor
came
to
the
rich
man
but
he
would
not
take
any
of
his
own
sheep
and
cattle
to
prepare
a
meal
for
the
traveler
who
had
come
to
him
Instead
he
took
the
poor
mans
lamb
and
prepared
it
for
the
man
who
had
come
to
him
5
At
this
David
grew
very
angry
against
the
man
and
he
said
to
Nathan
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
the
man
who
did
this
deserves
to
die
6
And
he
should
pay
for
the
lamb
four
times
over
because
he
did
this
and
showed
no
compassion
7
Then
Nathan
said
to
David
You
are
the
man
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
I
myself
anointed
you
as
king
over
Israel
and
I
rescued
you
from
the
hand
of
Saul
8
I
was
willing
to
give
you
your
masters
house
and
put
your
masters
wives
in
your
arms
and
I
gave
you
the
house
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
And
as
if
that
were
not
enough
I
was
willing
to
do
much
more
for
you
9
Why
did
you
despise
the
word
of
Jehovah
by
doing
what
is
bad
in
his
eyes
You
struck
down
Uriah
the
Hittite
with
the
sword
Then
you
took
his
wife
as
your
wife
after
you
killed
him
by
the
sword
of
the
Ammonites
10
Now
a
sword
will
never
depart
from
your
own
house
because
you
despised
me
by
taking
the
wife
of
Uriah
the
Hittite
as
your
wife
11
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
bringing
against
you
calamity
from
within
your
own
house
and
before
your
own
eyes
I
will
take
your
wives
and
give
them
to
another
man
and
he
will
lie
down
with
your
wives
in
broad
daylight
12
Although
you
acted
in
secret
I
will
do
this
in
front
of
all
Israel
and
in
broad
daylight
13
David
then
said
to
Nathan
I
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
Nathan
replied
to
David
Jehovah
in
turn
forgives
your
sin
You
will
not
die
14
Nevertheless
because
you
have
treated
Jehovah
with
utter
disrespect
in
this
matter
the
son
just
born
to
you
will
certainly
die
15
Then
Nathan
went
to
his
own
house
And
Jehovah
struck
the
child
whom
Uriahs
wife
had
borne
to
David
and
he
became
sick
16
David
pleaded
with
the
true
God
in
behalf
of
the
boy
David
went
on
a
strict
fast
and
would
go
in
and
spend
the
night
lying
on
the
ground
17
So
the
elders
of
his
house
stood
over
him
and
tried
to
raise
him
up
from
the
ground
but
he
refused
and
would
not
eat
with
them
18
On
the
seventh
day
the
child
died
but
Davids
servants
were
afraid
to
tell
him
that
the
child
was
dead
They
said
While
the
child
was
alive
we
spoke
to
him
and
he
did
not
listen
to
us
So
how
can
we
tell
him
that
the
child
has
died
He
may
do
something
terrible
19
When
David
saw
that
his
servants
were
whispering
to
one
another
he
discerned
that
the
child
had
died
David
said
to
his
servants
Has
the
child
died
They
replied
He
has
died
20
So
David
got
up
from
the
ground
He
washed
rubbed
himself
with
oil
changed
his
clothing
and
went
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
prostrated
himself
Afterward
he
went
to
his
house
and
asked
for
food
to
be
brought
to
him
and
he
ate
21
His
servants
asked
him
Why
have
you
acted
in
this
way
While
the
child
was
alive
you
fasted
and
kept
weeping
but
as
soon
as
the
child
died
you
got
up
and
ate
food
22
He
replied
While
the
child
was
alive
I
fasted
and
kept
weeping
because
I
said
to
myself
Who
knows
whether
Jehovah
may
show
me
favor
and
let
the
child
live
23
Now
that
he
has
died
why
should
I
fast
Can
I
bring
him
back
I
will
go
to
him
but
he
will
not
return
to
me
24
Then
David
comforted
his
wife
Bath-sheba
He
went
in
to
her
and
lay
down
with
her
In
time
she
bore
a
son
and
he
was
named
Solomon
And
Jehovah
loved
him
25
and
he
sent
word
through
Nathan
the
prophet
to
name
him
Jedidiah
for
the
sake
of
Jehovah
26
Joab
continued
fighting
against
Rabbah
of
the
Ammonites
and
he
captured
the
royal
city
27
So
Joab
sent
messengers
to
David
and
said
I
have
fought
against
Rabbah
and
I
have
captured
the
city
of
waters
28
Now
gather
the
rest
of
the
troops
and
encamp
against
the
city
and
capture
it
Otherwise
I
will
be
the
one
to
capture
the
city
and
it
will
be
credited
to
me
29
So
David
gathered
all
the
troops
and
went
to
Rabbah
and
fought
against
it
and
captured
it
30
Then
he
took
the
crown
of
Malcam
from
its
head
The
weight
of
it
was
a
talent
of
gold
along
with
precious
stones
and
it
was
placed
on
Davids
head
He
also
took
a
vast
amount
of
spoil
from
the
city
31
And
he
brought
out
the
people
who
were
in
it
and
put
them
to
work
at
sawing
stones
at
working
with
sharp
iron
instruments
and
with
iron
axes
and
at
brickmaking
That
was
what
he
did
to
all
the
cities
of
the
Ammonites
Finally
David
and
all
the
troops
returned
to
Jerusalem
1
Now
Davids
son
Absalom
had
a
beautiful
sister
named
Tamar
and
Davids
son
Amnon
fell
in
love
with
her
2
Amnon
was
so
distressed
that
he
became
sick
because
of
his
sister
Tamar
for
she
was
a
virgin
and
it
seemed
impossible
for
Amnon
to
do
anything
to
her
3
Now
Amnon
had
a
companion
named
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Shimeah
Davids
brother
and
Jehonadab
was
a
very
clever
man
4
So
he
said
to
him
Why
are
you
the
kings
son
so
depressed
every
morning
Why
not
tell
me
Amnon
replied
to
him
I
am
in
love
with
Tamar
the
sister
of
my
brother
Absalom
5
Jehonadab
replied
to
him
Lie
down
on
your
bed
and
pretend
to
be
sick
When
your
father
comes
to
see
you
say
to
him
Please
let
my
sister
Tamar
come
and
serve
me
some
food
If
she
prepares
the
food
given
to
the
sick
before
my
eyes
I
will
eat
it
from
her
hand
6
So
Amnon
lay
down
and
pretended
to
be
sick
and
the
king
came
in
to
see
him
Then
Amnon
said
to
the
king
Please
let
my
sister
Tamar
come
in
and
bake
two
heart-shaped
cakes
before
my
eyes
so
that
I
may
take
food
from
her
hand
7
At
that
David
sent
a
message
to
Tamar
at
the
house
saying
Please
go
to
the
house
of
your
brother
Amnon
and
prepare
food
for
him
8
So
Tamar
went
to
the
house
of
her
brother
Amnon
where
he
was
lying
down
She
took
the
dough
and
kneaded
it
into
cakes
before
his
eyes
and
cooked
the
cakes
9
Then
she
took
the
pan
and
served
him
But
Amnon
refused
to
eat
and
said
Have
everybody
leave
me
So
everybody
left
him
10
Amnon
now
said
to
Tamar
Bring
the
food
into
the
bedroom
so
that
I
may
eat
it
from
your
hand
So
Tamar
took
the
heart-shaped
cakes
that
she
had
made
and
brought
them
to
her
brother
Amnon
in
the
bedroom
11
When
she
brought
them
for
him
to
eat
he
grabbed
her
and
said
Come
lie
down
with
me
my
sister
12
But
she
said
to
him
No
my
brother
Do
not
humiliate
me
for
such
a
thing
is
not
done
in
Israel
Do
not
do
this
disgraceful
thing
13
How
could
I
live
down
my
shame
And
you
will
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
disgraceful
men
in
Israel
Now
speak
please
to
the
king
for
he
will
not
withhold
me
from
you
14
But
he
refused
to
listen
to
her
and
he
overpowered
her
and
humiliated
her
by
raping
her
15
Then
Amnon
began
hating
her
with
a
very
intense
hatred
so
that
his
hatred
for
her
became
greater
than
the
love
he
had
felt
for
her
Amnon
said
to
her
Get
up
go
away
16
At
this
she
said
to
him
No
my
brother
for
sending
me
away
now
is
worse
than
what
you
have
done
with
me
But
he
refused
to
listen
to
her
17
With
that
he
called
his
young
attendant
and
said
Get
this
person
out
of
my
presence
please
and
lock
the
door
behind
her
18
Now
she
was
wearing
a
special
robe
for
those
were
the
garments
that
the
virgin
daughters
of
the
king
wore
So
his
attendant
led
her
outside
and
he
locked
the
door
behind
her
19
Then
Tamar
put
ashes
on
her
head
and
she
ripped
apart
the
fine
robe
she
was
wearing
and
she
kept
her
hands
on
her
head
and
walked
off
crying
out
as
she
walked
20
At
this
her
brother
Absalom
asked
her
Was
it
your
brother
Amnon
who
was
with
you
And
now
keep
silent
my
sister
He
is
your
brother
Do
not
let
your
heart
dwell
on
this
matter
Then
Tamar
lived
in
isolation
at
the
house
of
her
brother
Absalom
21
When
King
David
heard
about
all
these
things
he
became
very
angry
But
he
would
not
hurt
the
feelings
of
Amnon
his
son
because
he
loved
him
for
he
was
his
firstborn
22
And
Absalom
said
nothing
to
Amnon
either
bad
or
good
for
Absalom
hated
Amnon
because
he
had
humiliated
his
sister
Tamar
23
After
two
full
years
Absaloms
sheepshearers
were
at
Baal-hazor
near
Ephraim
and
Absalom
invited
all
the
sons
of
the
king
24
So
Absalom
came
in
to
the
king
and
said
Your
servant
is
having
his
sheep
sheared
Please
let
the
king
and
his
servants
go
with
me
25
But
the
king
said
to
Absalom
No
my
son
If
all
of
us
go
we
will
be
a
burden
to
you
Although
he
kept
urging
him
he
did
not
consent
to
go
but
he
blessed
him
26
Absalom
then
said
If
not
you
please
let
my
brother
Amnon
go
with
us
The
king
replied
to
him
Why
should
he
go
with
you
27
But
Absalom
urged
him
so
he
sent
Amnon
and
all
the
kings
sons
with
him
28
Then
Absalom
ordered
his
attendants
Watch
and
when
Amnons
heart
is
in
a
cheerful
mood
from
the
wine
I
will
say
to
you
Strike
down
Amnon
You
must
then
put
him
to
death
Do
not
be
afraid
Is
it
not
I
who
command
you
Be
strong
and
courageous
29
So
Absaloms
attendants
did
to
Amnon
exactly
as
Absalom
had
ordered
then
all
the
other
sons
of
the
king
got
up
and
each
one
mounted
his
mule
and
fled
30
While
they
were
on
the
way
the
report
reached
David
Absalom
has
struck
down
all
the
sons
of
the
king
and
not
one
of
them
survived
31
At
this
the
king
got
up
and
ripped
his
clothes
apart
and
lay
on
the
ground
and
all
his
servants
were
standing
by
with
their
garments
ripped
apart
32
However
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Shimeah
Davids
brother
said
Do
not
let
my
lord
think
that
they
have
killed
all
the
young
sons
of
the
king
for
only
Amnon
has
died
This
is
by
the
order
of
Absalom
who
decided
to
do
this
from
the
day
that
Amnon
humiliated
his
sister
Tamar
33
Now
do
not
let
my
lord
the
king
pay
attention
to
the
report
that
says
All
the
kings
sons
have
died
only
Amnon
has
died
34
Meanwhile
Absalom
ran
away
Later
the
watchman
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
that
there
were
many
people
coming
from
the
road
behind
him
next
to
the
mountain
35
At
this
Jehonadab
said
to
the
king
Look
The
kings
sons
have
returned
It
is
just
as
your
servant
said
36
As
he
finished
speaking
the
kings
sons
came
in
weeping
loudly
also
the
king
and
all
his
servants
wept
very
bitterly
37
But
Absalom
fled
and
went
to
Talmai
the
son
of
Ammihud
the
king
of
Geshur
David
mourned
his
son
for
many
days
38
After
Absalom
fled
and
went
to
Geshur
he
stayed
there
for
three
years
39
Finally
King
David
longed
to
go
to
Absalom
for
he
had
become
reconciled
to
the
death
of
Amnon
1
Now
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
learned
that
the
kings
heart
longed
for
Absalom
2
So
Joab
sent
to
Tekoa
and
summoned
from
there
a
clever
woman
and
told
her
Act
like
you
are
in
mourning
please
and
put
on
garments
of
mourning
and
do
not
rub
yourself
with
oil
Behave
like
a
woman
who
has
been
mourning
over
someone
dead
for
a
long
time
3
Then
go
in
and
speak
to
the
king
like
this
With
that
Joab
put
the
words
in
her
mouth
4
The
Tekoite
woman
went
in
to
the
king
and
fell
with
her
face
to
the
ground
and
prostrated
herself
and
said
Help
me
O
king
5
The
king
replied
to
her
What
is
the
matter
To
this
she
said
Alas
I
am
a
widow
my
husband
is
dead
6
And
I
your
servant
had
two
sons
and
the
two
of
them
fought
with
each
other
in
the
field
There
was
no
one
to
separate
them
and
one
struck
the
other
down
and
killed
him
7
Now
the
whole
family
has
risen
up
against
me
your
servant
and
they
are
saying
Hand
over
the
one
who
struck
his
brother
so
that
we
may
put
him
to
death
for
the
life
of
his
brother
whom
he
killed
even
if
it
means
wiping
out
the
heir
They
would
extinguish
the
last
glowing
coal
that
I
have
left
and
leave
to
my
husband
neither
a
name
nor
a
survivor
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
8
Then
the
king
said
to
the
woman
Go
to
your
home
and
I
will
issue
an
order
regarding
you
9
At
this
the
Tekoite
woman
said
to
the
king
O
my
lord
the
king
let
the
guilt
be
on
me
and
on
my
fathers
house
while
the
king
and
his
throne
are
innocent
10
The
king
then
said
If
anyone
speaks
further
to
you
bring
him
to
me
and
he
will
never
trouble
you
again
11
But
she
said
Please
let
the
king
remember
Jehovah
your
God
so
that
the
avenger
of
blood
does
not
bring
ruin
and
annihilate
my
son
To
this
he
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
not
one
of
your
sons
hairs
will
fall
to
the
ground
12
The
woman
now
said
Let
your
servant
please
speak
a
word
to
my
lord
the
king
So
he
said
Speak
13
The
woman
said
Why
then
have
you
thought
to
do
something
like
this
against
the
people
of
God
When
the
king
speaks
this
way
he
makes
himself
guilty
for
the
king
does
not
bring
back
his
own
banished
son
14
We
will
surely
die
and
be
like
waters
that
are
poured
out
on
the
ground
which
cannot
be
recovered
But
God
would
not
take
away
a
life
and
he
considers
reasons
why
the
banished
one
should
not
always
be
banished
from
him
15
I
have
come
in
to
say
this
to
my
lord
the
king
because
the
people
made
me
afraid
So
your
servant
said
Let
me
speak
please
to
the
king
Perhaps
the
king
will
act
on
the
request
of
his
slave
16
The
king
may
listen
and
rescue
his
slave
from
the
hand
of
the
man
seeking
to
annihilate
me
and
my
only
son
from
the
inheritance
God
gave
us
17
Then
your
servant
said
May
the
word
of
my
lord
the
king
please
give
me
relief

for
my
lord
the
king
is
just
like
an
angel
of
the
true
God
in
distinguishing
what
is
good
from
what
is
bad
May
Jehovah
your
God
be
with
you
18
The
king
now
answered
the
woman
Please
do
not
hide
from
me
anything
I
ask
you
The
woman
replied
Let
my
lord
the
king
speak
please
19
The
king
then
asked
Did
Joab
put
you
up
to
all
of
this
The
woman
answered
As
surely
as
you
are
living
O
my
lord
the
king
it
is
just
as
my
lord
the
king
says
for
it
was
your
servant
Joab
who
instructed
me
and
put
all
these
words
in
the
mouth
of
your
servant
20
Your
servant
Joab
has
done
this
to
change
the
appearance
of
things
but
my
lord
has
wisdom
like
that
of
the
angel
of
the
true
God
and
knows
all
that
is
happening
in
the
land
21
The
king
then
said
to
Joab
All
right
I
will
do
this
thing
Go
and
bring
back
the
young
man
Absalom
22
At
this
Joab
fell
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
prostrated
himself
and
praised
the
king
Joab
said
Today
your
servant
knows
that
I
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
O
my
lord
the
king
because
the
king
has
acted
on
the
request
of
his
servant
23
Then
Joab
got
up
and
went
to
Geshur
and
brought
Absalom
to
Jerusalem
24
However
the
king
said
Let
him
return
to
his
own
house
but
he
may
not
see
my
face
So
Absalom
returned
to
his
own
house
and
he
did
not
see
the
face
of
the
king
25
Now
in
all
Israel
no
man
was
as
highly
praised
for
his
handsome
appearance
as
Absalom
From
the
sole
of
his
foot
to
the
crown
of
his
head
there
was
no
flaw
in
him
26
When
he
shaved
his
head—he
had
to
shave
it
at
the
end
of
every
year
because
it
was
so
heavy
for
him—the
hair
of
his
head
weighed
200
shekels
by
the
royal
stone
weight
27
To
Absalom
were
born
three
sons
and
one
daughter
whose
name
was
Tamar
She
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
28
And
Absalom
continued
living
in
Jerusalem
for
two
full
years
but
he
did
not
see
the
face
of
the
king
29
So
Absalom
summoned
Joab
in
order
to
send
him
to
the
king
but
Joab
would
not
come
to
him
Then
he
sent
for
him
again
a
second
time
and
he
still
refused
to
come
30
Finally
he
said
to
his
servants
Joabs
plot
of
land
is
next
to
mine
and
he
has
some
barley
there
Go
and
set
it
on
fire
So
the
servants
of
Absalom
set
the
plot
of
land
on
fire
31
At
this
Joab
got
up
and
came
to
Absaloms
house
and
said
to
him
Why
did
your
servants
set
my
plot
of
land
on
fire
32
Absalom
replied
to
Joab
Look
I
sent
this
message
to
you
Come
and
let
me
send
you
to
the
king
to
ask
Why
have
I
come
from
Geshur
It
would
have
been
better
for
me
to
stay
there
Now
let
me
see
the
face
of
the
king
and
if
there
is
guilt
in
me
then
he
should
put
me
to
death
33
So
Joab
went
in
to
the
king
and
told
him
Then
he
called
Absalom
who
came
in
to
the
king
and
prostrated
himself
before
him
falling
with
his
face
to
the
ground
before
the
king
Then
the
king
kissed
Absalom
1
After
all
these
things
Absalom
acquired
for
himself
a
chariot
and
horses
and
50
men
to
run
before
him
2
Absalom
would
rise
up
early
and
stand
at
the
side
of
the
road
to
the
city
gate
Whenever
any
man
had
a
legal
case
that
was
to
come
to
the
king
for
judgment
Absalom
would
call
him
and
say
From
what
city
are
you
and
he
would
say
Your
servant
is
from
one
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
3
Absalom
would
say
to
him
See
your
claims
are
right
and
proper
but
there
is
no
one
from
the
king
to
hear
your
case
4
Absalom
would
say
If
only
I
were
appointed
judge
in
the
land
Then
every
man
who
has
a
legal
case
or
judgment
could
come
to
me
and
I
would
see
that
he
receives
justice
5
And
when
a
man
came
near
to
bow
down
to
him
Absalom
would
extend
his
hand
and
grab
hold
of
him
and
kiss
him
6
Absalom
would
do
this
to
all
the
Israelites
who
would
come
in
to
the
king
for
judgment
so
Absalom
kept
stealing
the
hearts
of
the
men
of
Israel
7
At
the
end
of
four
years
Absalom
said
to
the
king
Let
me
go
please
to
Hebron
to
pay
my
vow
that
I
made
to
Jehovah
8
For
your
servant
made
this
solemn
vow
when
I
was
dwelling
in
Geshur
in
Syria
If
Jehovah
will
bring
me
back
to
Jerusalem
I
will
make
an
offering
to
Jehovah
9
So
the
king
said
to
him
Go
in
peace
With
that
he
rose
up
and
went
to
Hebron
10
Absalom
now
sent
spies
through
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
saying
As
soon
as
you
hear
the
sound
of
the
horn
announce
Absalom
has
become
king
in
Hebron
11
Now
200
men
from
Jerusalem
had
gone
there
with
Absalom
they
were
invited
and
went
unsuspectingly
unaware
of
what
was
happening
12
Further
when
he
offered
the
sacrifices
Absalom
sent
for
Ahithophel
the
Gilonite
Davids
adviser
from
his
city
Giloh
The
conspiracy
kept
gaining
momentum
and
the
people
who
supported
Absalom
were
growing
in
number
13
In
time
an
informer
came
to
David
saying
The
heart
of
the
men
of
Israel
has
turned
to
Absalom
14
At
once
David
said
to
all
his
servants
with
him
in
Jerusalem
Get
up
and
let
us
run
away
for
none
of
us
will
escape
from
Absalom
Hurry
for
fear
he
may
quickly
overtake
us
and
bring
disaster
on
us
and
strike
the
city
with
the
sword
15
The
kings
servants
replied
to
the
king
Whatever
my
lord
the
king
decides
your
servants
are
ready
to
do
16
So
the
king
went
out
with
all
his
household
following
him
but
the
king
left
ten
concubines
to
take
care
of
the
house
17
And
the
king
continued
on
his
way
out
with
all
the
people
following
and
they
stopped
at
Beth-merhak
18
All
his
servants
leaving
with
him
and
all
the
Cherethites
the
Pelethites
and
the
Gittites
600
men
who
had
followed
him
from
Gath
were
passing
by
as
the
king
reviewed
them
19
Then
the
king
said
to
Ittai
the
Gittite
Why
should
you
also
go
with
us
Go
back
and
dwell
with
the
new
king
for
you
are
a
foreigner
and
also
an
exile
from
your
place
20
Yesterday
you
came
so
today
should
I
make
you
wander
with
us
to
go
when
I
must
go
and
where
I
must
go
Go
back
and
take
your
brothers
with
you
and
may
Jehovah
show
you
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
21
But
Ittai
answered
the
king
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
and
as
surely
as
my
lord
the
king
is
living
wherever
my
lord
the
king
may
be
whether
for
death
or
for
life
there
your
servant
will
be
22
At
that
David
said
to
Ittai
Go
and
cross
over
So
Ittai
the
Gittite
crossed
over
together
with
all
his
men
and
children
23
Everyone
in
the
land
was
weeping
loudly
while
all
these
people
crossed
over
and
the
king
was
standing
by
the
Kidron
Valley
all
the
people
were
crossing
over
to
the
road
leading
to
the
wilderness
24
Zadok
was
also
there
and
with
him
were
all
the
Levites
carrying
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
true
God
and
they
set
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
down
and
Abiathar
went
up
while
all
the
people
completed
crossing
over
from
the
city
25
But
the
king
said
to
Zadok
Take
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
back
to
the
city
If
I
find
favor
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
he
will
also
bring
me
back
and
let
me
see
it
and
its
dwelling
place
26
But
if
he
should
say
I
have
found
no
pleasure
in
you

then
let
him
do
to
me
whatever
seems
good
in
his
eyes
27
The
king
said
to
Zadok
the
priest
Are
you
not
a
seer
Return
to
the
city
in
peace
and
take
the
two
sons
of
you
men
with
you
Ahimaaz
your
own
son
and
Jonathan
the
son
of
Abiathar
28
See
I
will
linger
by
the
fords
of
the
wilderness
until
word
comes
from
you
to
inform
me
29
So
Zadok
and
Abiathar
took
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
back
to
Jerusalem
and
they
remained
there
30
As
David
was
going
up
the
Mount
of
Olives
he
was
weeping
as
he
went
up
his
head
was
covered
and
he
was
walking
barefoot
All
the
people
with
him
also
covered
their
heads
and
were
weeping
as
they
went
up
31
David
was
then
told
Ahithophel
is
among
those
conspiring
with
Absalom
At
this
David
said
Turn
please
the
advice
of
Ahithophel
into
foolishness
O
Jehovah
32
When
David
came
to
the
summit
where
people
used
to
bow
down
to
God
Hushai
the
Archite
was
there
to
meet
him
with
his
robe
ripped
apart
and
dirt
on
his
head
33
However
David
said
to
him
If
you
go
across
with
me
you
will
be
a
load
on
me
34
But
if
you
return
to
the
city
and
you
say
to
Absalom
I
am
your
servant
O
King
I
was
the
servant
of
your
father
in
the
past
but
now
I
am
your
servant

you
can
then
frustrate
the
advice
of
Ahithophel
for
me
35
Are
not
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
priests
there
with
you
You
must
tell
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
priests
everything
that
you
hear
from
the
house
of
the
king
36
Look
There
with
them
are
their
two
sons
Ahimaaz
the
son
of
Zadok
and
Jonathan
the
son
of
Abiathar
and
through
them
send
to
me
everything
that
you
hear
37
So
Hushai
Davids
friend
went
into
the
city
as
Absalom
was
entering
into
Jerusalem
1
When
David
had
passed
a
little
beyond
the
summit
Ziba
the
attendant
of
Mephibosheth
was
there
to
meet
him
with
a
couple
of
saddled
donkeys
and
on
them
were
200
loaves
of
bread
100
cakes
of
raisins
100
cakes
of
summer
fruit
and
a
large
jar
of
wine
2
Then
the
king
said
to
Ziba
Why
have
you
brought
these
things
Ziba
replied
The
donkeys
are
for
the
household
of
the
king
to
ride
the
bread
and
the
summer
fruit
are
for
the
young
men
to
eat
and
the
wine
is
for
those
who
get
exhausted
in
the
wilderness
to
drink
3
The
king
now
said
And
where
is
the
son
of
your
master
At
this
Ziba
said
to
the
king
He
is
staying
in
Jerusalem
for
he
said
Today
the
house
of
Israel
will
give
back
the
royal
rule
of
my
father
to
me
4
The
king
then
said
to
Ziba
Look
Everything
that
belongs
to
Mephibosheth
is
yours
Ziba
replied
I
bow
down
before
you
May
I
find
favor
in
your
eyes
my
lord
the
king
5
When
King
David
reached
Bahurim
a
man
of
the
family
of
Sauls
house
named
Shimei
the
son
of
Gera
came
out
shouting
curses
as
he
approached
6
He
was
throwing
stones
at
David
and
at
all
the
servants
of
King
David
as
well
as
at
all
the
people
and
the
mighty
men
on
his
right
and
on
his
left
7
Shimei
said
as
he
cursed
Get
out
get
out
you
bloodguilty
man
You
worthless
man
8
Jehovah
has
brought
back
on
you
all
the
bloodguilt
for
the
house
of
Saul
in
whose
place
you
have
ruled
as
king
but
Jehovah
gives
the
kingship
into
the
hand
of
Absalom
your
son
Now
calamity
has
overtaken
you
because
you
are
a
bloodguilty
man
9
Then
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
said
to
the
king
Why
should
this
dead
dog
curse
my
lord
the
king
Let
me
go
over
please
and
take
off
his
head
10
But
the
king
said
What
do
I
have
to
do
with
you
you
sons
of
Zeruiah
Let
him
curse
me
for
Jehovah
has
said
to
him
Curse
David
So
who
should
say
Why
are
you
doing
this
11
David
then
said
to
Abishai
and
all
his
servants
Here
my
own
son
who
came
from
my
own
body
is
seeking
my
life
and
how
much
more
now
a
Benjaminite
Leave
him
alone
so
that
he
may
curse
me
for
Jehovah
told
him
to
12
Perhaps
Jehovah
will
see
my
affliction
and
Jehovah
will
restore
goodness
to
me
instead
of
the
curses
shouted
at
me
this
day
13
With
that
David
and
his
men
kept
going
down
the
road
while
Shimei
was
walking
alongside
the
mountain
abreast
of
him
shouting
curses
and
throwing
stones
and
a
lot
of
dust
14
At
length
the
king
and
all
the
people
with
him
arrived
at
their
destination
exhausted
and
they
refreshed
themselves
15
Meanwhile
Absalom
and
all
the
men
of
Israel
arrived
in
Jerusalem
and
Ahithophel
was
with
him
16
When
Hushai
the
Archite
Davids
friend
came
in
to
Absalom
Hushai
said
to
Absalom
Long
live
the
king
Long
live
the
king
17
At
this
Absalom
said
to
Hushai
Is
this
your
loyal
love
toward
your
friend
Why
did
you
not
go
with
your
friend
18
So
Hushai
said
to
Absalom
No
I
am
on
the
side
of
the
one
who
has
been
chosen
by
Jehovah
this
people
and
all
the
men
of
Israel
I
will
stay
with
him
19
And
again
I
say
Whom
should
I
serve
Should
it
not
be
his
son
Just
as
I
served
your
father
so
I
will
serve
you
20
Absalom
then
said
to
Ahithophel
Give
me
your
advice
What
should
we
do
21
At
that
Ahithophel
said
to
Absalom
Have
relations
with
your
fathers
concubines
those
whom
he
left
behind
to
take
care
of
the
house
Then
all
Israel
will
hear
that
you
have
made
yourself
a
stench
to
your
father
and
those
who
support
you
will
be
strengthened
22
So
they
pitched
a
tent
for
Absalom
on
the
roof
and
Absalom
had
relations
with
the
concubines
of
his
father
before
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
23
In
those
days
the
advice
that
Ahithophel
gave
was
considered
as
the
word
of
the
true
God
That
was
how
all
the
advice
of
Ahithophel
was
esteemed
both
by
David
and
by
Absalom
1
Ahithophel
then
said
to
Absalom
Please
let
me
choose
12000
men
and
rise
up
and
chase
after
David
tonight
2
I
will
come
upon
him
when
he
is
weary
and
powerless
and
I
will
throw
him
into
a
panic
and
all
the
people
who
are
with
him
will
flee
and
I
will
strike
down
only
the
king
3
Then
I
will
bring
all
the
people
back
to
you
The
return
of
all
the
people
depends
on
what
happens
with
the
man
you
are
seeking
Then
all
the
people
will
be
at
peace
4
The
proposal
was
just
right
in
the
eyes
of
Absalom
and
all
the
elders
of
Israel
5
However
Absalom
said
Please
call
Hushai
the
Archite
as
well
and
let
us
hear
what
he
has
to
say
6
So
Hushai
came
in
to
Absalom
Then
Absalom
said
to
him
This
is
the
advice
Ahithophel
gave
Should
we
act
on
his
advice
If
not
you
tell
us
7
At
this
Hushai
said
to
Absalom
The
advice
that
Ahithophel
gave
is
not
good
in
this
instance
8
Hushai
continued
You
well
know
that
your
father
and
his
men
are
mighty
and
they
are
desperate
like
a
bear
that
has
lost
her
cubs
in
the
field
Moreover
your
father
is
a
warrior
and
he
will
not
spend
the
night
with
the
people
9
At
this
very
moment
he
is
hiding
in
one
of
the
caves
or
in
some
other
place
and
if
he
attacks
first
those
hearing
of
it
will
say
The
people
following
Absalom
have
been
defeated
10
Even
the
courageous
man
whose
heart
is
like
that
of
a
lion
will
surely
melt
in
fear
for
all
Israel
knows
that
your
father
is
a
mighty
man
and
that
the
men
with
him
are
courageous
11
I
give
this
advice
Let
all
Israel
be
gathered
to
you
from
Dan
to
Beer-sheba
as
many
as
the
grains
of
sand
by
the
sea
and
you
should
lead
them
into
the
fight
12
We
will
come
against
him
wherever
he
is
found
and
we
will
come
upon
him
just
like
the
dew
that
falls
on
the
ground
and
not
one
of
them
will
survive
not
he
nor
any
of
the
men
with
him
13
If
he
retreats
into
a
city
all
Israel
will
carry
ropes
to
that
city
and
we
will
drag
it
down
into
the
valley
until
not
even
a
pebble
is
left
14
Then
Absalom
and
all
the
men
of
Israel
said
The
advice
of
Hushai
the
Archite
is
better
than
the
advice
of
Ahithophel
For
Jehovah
had
determined
to
frustrate
the
sound
advice
of
Ahithophel
so
that
Jehovah
could
bring
disaster
on
Absalom
15
Hushai
later
said
to
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
priests
This
is
what
Ahithophel
has
advised
Absalom
and
the
elders
of
Israel
and
this
is
what
I
have
advised
16
Now
quickly
send
word
to
David
and
warn
him
Do
not
stay
at
the
fords
of
the
wilderness
tonight
but
cross
over
without
fail
or
the
king
and
all
the
people
with
him
may
be
wiped
out
17
Jonathan
and
Ahimaaz
were
staying
at
En-rogel
so
a
servant
girl
went
off
and
told
them
and
they
went
to
tell
King
David
for
they
did
not
dare
to
be
seen
entering
the
city
18
However
a
young
man
saw
them
and
told
Absalom
So
the
two
of
them
quickly
went
off
and
came
to
the
house
of
a
man
in
Bahurim
who
had
a
well
in
his
courtyard
They
went
down
into
it
19
and
the
mans
wife
spread
a
covering
over
the
top
of
the
well
and
covered
it
with
cracked
grain
no
one
knew
about
it
20
The
servants
of
Absalom
came
to
the
woman
at
her
house
and
asked
Where
are
Ahimaaz
and
Jonathan
The
woman
replied
They
passed
by
toward
the
water
Then
the
men
searched
for
them
but
did
not
find
them
so
they
returned
to
Jerusalem
21
After
the
men
were
gone
they
came
up
out
of
the
well
and
went
and
informed
King
David
They
said
to
him
Rise
up
and
quickly
cross
the
water
for
this
is
what
Ahithophel
advised
against
you
22
Immediately
David
and
all
the
people
with
him
rose
up
and
crossed
the
Jordan
By
daybreak
there
was
no
one
left
who
had
not
crossed
the
Jordan
23
When
Ahithophel
saw
that
his
advice
had
not
been
acted
on
he
saddled
a
donkey
and
went
to
his
house
in
his
hometown
After
he
gave
instructions
to
his
household
he
hanged
himself
So
he
died
and
was
buried
in
the
burial
place
of
his
forefathers
24
Meanwhile
David
went
to
Mahanaim
and
Absalom
crossed
the
Jordan
with
all
the
men
of
Israel
25
Absalom
put
Amasa
in
charge
of
the
army
in
place
of
Joab
Amasa
was
the
son
of
a
man
named
Ithra
the
Israelite
who
had
relations
with
Abigail
the
daughter
of
Nahash
the
sister
of
Zeruiah
Joabs
mother
26
Israel
and
Absalom
camped
in
the
land
of
Gilead
27
As
soon
as
David
came
to
Mahanaim
Shobi
the
son
of
Nahash
from
Rabbah
of
the
Ammonites
Machir
the
son
of
Ammiel
from
Lo-debar
and
Barzillai
the
Gileadite
from
Rogelim
28
brought
beds
basins
clay
pots
wheat
barley
flour
roasted
grain
broad
beans
lentils
parched
grain
29
honey
butter
sheep
and
cheese
They
brought
all
of
this
out
for
David
and
the
people
with
him
to
eat
for
they
said
The
people
are
hungry
and
tired
and
thirsty
in
the
wilderness
1
Then
David
numbered
the
men
who
were
with
him
and
placed
over
them
chiefs
of
thousands
and
chiefs
of
hundreds
2
And
David
sent
one
third
of
the
men
under
the
command
of
Joab
one
third
under
the
command
of
Joabs
brother
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
and
one
third
under
the
command
of
Ittai
the
Gittite
The
king
then
said
to
the
men
I
will
also
go
out
with
you
3
But
they
said
You
must
not
go
out
for
if
we
flee
they
would
not
care
about
us
and
if
half
of
us
would
die
they
would
not
care
about
us
because
you
are
worth
10000
of
us
Therefore
it
would
be
better
if
you
would
send
us
help
from
the
city
4
The
king
said
to
them
Whatever
seems
best
to
you
I
will
do
So
the
king
stood
next
to
the
city
gate
and
all
the
men
went
out
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
5
Then
the
king
gave
Joab
and
Abishai
and
Ittai
this
order
Deal
gently
with
the
young
man
Absalom
for
my
sake
All
the
men
heard
it
when
the
king
gave
all
the
chiefs
the
order
about
Absalom
6
The
men
went
out
to
the
field
to
meet
Israel
and
the
battle
took
place
in
the
forest
of
Ephraim
7
There
the
people
of
Israel
were
defeated
by
the
servants
of
David
and
a
great
slaughter
took
place
on
that
day—20000
men
8
The
battle
spread
through
the
whole
region
Furthermore
the
forest
devoured
more
of
the
people
than
the
sword
did
on
that
day
9
Absalom
eventually
found
himself
facing
the
servants
of
David
Absalom
was
riding
on
a
mule
and
the
mule
went
under
the
thick
branches
of
a
large
tree
and
his
head
got
entangled
in
the
big
tree
so
that
he
was
suspended
in
midair
while
the
mule
he
had
been
riding
kept
going
10
Then
someone
saw
it
and
told
Joab
Look
I
have
seen
Absalom
hanging
in
a
big
tree
11
Joab
replied
to
the
man
who
told
him
If
you
saw
it
why
did
you
not
strike
him
down
to
the
ground
on
the
spot
Then
I
would
have
gladly
given
you
ten
pieces
of
silver
and
a
belt
12
But
the
man
said
to
Joab
Even
if
I
were
handed
1000
pieces
of
silver
I
could
not
lift
my
hand
against
the
kings
son
for
we
heard
the
king
order
you
and
Abishai
and
Ittai
Whoever
you
are
watch
over
the
young
man
Absalom
13
If
I
had
disobeyed
and
taken
his
life
it
could
never
have
remained
hidden
from
the
king
and
you
would
not
have
protected
me
14
To
this
Joab
said
I
am
not
going
to
waste
any
more
time
with
you
So
he
took
three
spikes
in
his
hand
and
drove
them
through
the
heart
of
Absalom
while
he
was
still
alive
in
the
midst
of
the
big
tree
15
Then
ten
attendants
who
carried
Joabs
weapons
came
and
struck
Absalom
until
he
was
dead
16
Joab
now
blew
the
horn
and
the
men
returned
from
chasing
after
Israel
Joab
called
for
them
to
halt
17
They
took
Absalom
and
threw
him
into
a
big
pit
in
the
forest
and
piled
up
over
him
a
very
big
heap
of
stones
And
all
Israel
fled
to
their
homes
18
Now
Absalom
while
he
was
alive
had
taken
and
set
up
for
himself
a
pillar
in
the
Valley
of
the
King
for
he
said
I
have
no
son
to
preserve
the
memory
of
my
name
So
he
named
the
pillar
after
himself
and
it
is
called
Absaloms
Monument
to
this
day
19
Ahimaaz
the
son
of
Zadok
said
Let
me
run
please
and
break
the
news
to
the
king
for
Jehovah
has
given
him
justice
by
freeing
him
from
his
enemies
20
But
Joab
said
to
him
You
will
not
be
a
bearer
of
news
this
day
You
may
break
the
news
on
another
day
but
today
you
will
not
break
the
news
because
the
kings
own
son
has
died
21
Then
Joab
said
to
a
Cushite
Go
tell
the
king
what
you
have
seen
At
that
the
Cushite
bowed
to
Joab
and
ran
off
22
Ahimaaz
the
son
of
Zadok
said
once
again
to
Joab
Whatever
happens
please
let
me
also
run
behind
the
Cushite
However
Joab
said
Why
should
you
run
my
son
when
there
is
no
news
for
you
to
tell
23
Still
he
said
Whatever
happens
let
me
run
So
Joab
said
to
him
Run
And
Ahimaaz
ran
by
the
way
of
the
district
of
the
Jordan
and
he
eventually
overtook
the
Cushite
24
Now
David
was
sitting
between
the
two
city
gates
and
the
watchman
went
up
to
the
roof
of
the
gate
by
the
wall
He
looked
up
and
saw
a
man
running
by
himself
25
So
the
watchman
called
out
and
told
the
king
The
king
said
If
he
is
by
himself
he
has
news
to
tell
As
he
came
steadily
nearer
26
the
watchman
saw
another
man
running
The
watchman
then
called
to
the
gatekeeper
Look
Another
man
running
by
himself
The
king
said
This
one
is
also
bringing
news
27
The
watchman
said
I
can
see
that
the
first
man
runs
like
Ahimaaz
the
son
of
Zadok

so
the
king
said
He
is
a
good
man
and
he
comes
with
good
news
28
Ahimaaz
then
called
out
to
the
king
All
is
well
With
that
he
bowed
to
the
king
with
his
face
to
the
ground
Then
he
said
May
Jehovah
your
God
be
praised
who
has
surrendered
the
men
who
rebelled
against
my
lord
the
king
29
However
the
king
said
Is
everything
all
right
with
the
young
man
Absalom
To
this
Ahimaaz
said
I
saw
the
great
commotion
when
Joab
sent
the
kings
servant
and
your
servant
but
I
did
not
know
what
it
was
30
So
the
king
said
Step
aside
stand
here
At
that
he
stepped
aside
and
stood
there
31
Then
the
Cushite
arrived
and
the
Cushite
said
Let
my
lord
the
king
accept
this
news
Today
Jehovah
has
brought
justice
by
freeing
you
from
the
hand
of
all
those
who
rebelled
against
you
32
But
the
king
said
to
the
Cushite
Is
everything
all
right
with
the
young
man
Absalom
To
this
the
Cushite
said
May
all
the
enemies
of
my
lord
the
king
and
all
those
who
rebelled
against
you
to
harm
you
become
like
the
young
man
33
This
disturbed
the
king
and
he
went
up
to
the
roof
chamber
over
the
gateway
and
wept
saying
as
he
walked
My
son
Absalom
my
son
my
son
Absalom
If
only
I
had
died
instead
of
you
Absalom
my
son
my
son
1
It
was
reported
to
Joab
The
king
is
weeping
and
mourning
for
Absalom
2
So
the
victory
on
that
day
was
turned
into
mourning
for
all
the
people
because
they
heard
that
the
king
was
grieving
over
his
son
3
The
people
quietly
returned
to
the
city
that
day
like
people
who
are
ashamed
because
they
fled
in
the
battle
4
The
king
covered
his
face
and
kept
crying
out
with
a
loud
voice
My
son
Absalom
Absalom
my
son
my
son
5
Then
Joab
went
in
to
the
king
at
the
house
and
said
Today
you
have
put
to
shame
all
your
servants
who
this
day
saved
your
life
and
the
lives
of
your
sons
your
daughters
your
wives
and
your
concubines
6
You
love
those
who
hate
you
and
hate
those
who
love
you
for
you
have
made
it
clear
today
that
your
chiefs
and
servants
mean
nothing
to
you
because
I
am
sure
that
if
only
Absalom
were
alive
today
and
the
rest
of
us
were
dead
it
would
be
all
right
with
you
7
Now
get
up
go
out
and
reassure
your
servants
because
by
Jehovah
I
swear
that
if
you
do
not
go
out
not
a
man
will
remain
with
you
tonight
This
will
be
worse
for
you
than
all
the
injury
that
has
come
upon
you
from
your
youth
until
now
8
So
the
king
rose
up
and
sat
in
the
city
gate
and
all
the
people
were
informed
Now
the
king
is
sitting
in
the
gate
Then
all
the
people
came
before
the
king
But
Israel
had
fled
each
to
his
home
9
All
the
people
in
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
were
disputing
saying
The
king
saved
us
from
our
enemies
and
he
rescued
us
from
the
Philistines
but
now
he
has
fled
the
land
because
of
Absalom
10
And
Absalom
whom
we
anointed
over
us
has
died
in
the
battle
So
now
why
are
you
doing
nothing
to
bring
the
king
back
11
King
David
sent
this
message
to
Zadok
and
Abiathar
the
priests
Speak
to
the
elders
of
Judah
saying
Why
should
you
be
the
last
ones
to
bring
the
king
back
to
his
house
when
the
word
of
all
Israel
has
come
to
the
king
at
his
house
12
You
are
my
brothers
you
are
my
own
bone
and
flesh
Why
should
you
be
the
last
ones
to
bring
the
king
back
13
And
you
should
say
to
Amasa
Are
you
not
my
own
bone
and
flesh
So
may
God
do
to
me
and
add
to
it
if
you
will
not
become
my
army
chief
from
now
on
instead
of
Joab
14
So
he
won
over
the
hearts
of
all
the
men
of
Judah
as
one
man
and
they
sent
word
to
the
king
Come
back
you
and
all
your
servants
15
The
king
started
back
and
reached
the
Jordan
and
the
people
of
Judah
came
to
Gilgal
to
meet
the
king
and
to
escort
him
across
the
Jordan
16
Then
Shimei
the
son
of
Gera
the
Benjaminite
from
Bahurim
hurried
down
with
the
men
of
Judah
to
meet
King
David
17
and
there
were
1000
men
from
Benjamin
with
him
Also
Ziba
the
attendant
of
the
house
of
Saul
with
his
15
sons
and
20
servants
rushed
down
to
the
Jordan
ahead
of
the
king
18
He
crossed
the
ford
to
bring
the
kings
household
across
and
to
do
whatever
he
desired
But
Shimei
the
son
of
Gera
fell
down
before
the
king
when
he
was
about
to
cross
the
Jordan
19
He
said
to
the
king
Do
not
let
my
lord
hold
me
guilty
and
do
not
remember
the
wrong
your
servant
did
on
the
day
that
my
lord
the
king
went
out
of
Jerusalem
May
the
king
not
take
it
to
heart
20
for
your
servant
well
knows
that
I
have
sinned
so
today
I
have
been
the
first
of
all
the
house
of
Joseph
to
come
down
to
meet
my
lord
the
king
21
At
once
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
said
Should
not
Shimei
be
put
to
death
for
this
because
he
cursed
the
anointed
of
Jehovah
22
But
David
said
What
does
this
have
to
do
with
you
you
sons
of
Zeruiah
that
you
should
act
against
me
today
Should
anyone
be
put
to
death
today
in
Israel
For
do
I
not
know
that
today
I
am
king
over
Israel
23
Then
the
king
said
to
Shimei
You
will
not
die
And
the
king
gave
him
his
oath
24
Mephibosheth
the
grandson
of
Saul
also
came
down
to
meet
the
king
He
had
not
cared
for
his
feet
or
trimmed
his
mustache
or
washed
his
garments
from
the
day
the
king
left
until
the
day
he
returned
in
peace
25
When
he
came
to
Jerusalem
to
meet
the
king
the
king
said
to
him
Why
did
you
not
go
with
me
Mephibosheth
26
To
this
he
said
My
lord
the
king
my
servant
tricked
me
For
your
servant
had
said
Let
me
get
my
donkey
saddled
so
that
I
may
ride
on
it
and
go
with
the
king

for
your
servant
is
crippled
27
But
he
slandered
your
servant
to
my
lord
the
king
However
my
lord
the
king
is
like
an
angel
of
the
true
God
so
do
whatever
seems
good
to
you
28
All
the
household
of
my
father
could
have
been
doomed
to
death
by
my
lord
the
king
and
yet
you
placed
your
servant
among
those
eating
at
your
table
So
what
right
do
I
have
to
cry
out
further
to
the
king
29
However
the
king
said
to
him
Why
keep
on
speaking
like
this
I
have
decided
that
you
and
Ziba
should
share
the
field
30
At
this
Mephibosheth
said
to
the
king
Let
him
take
it
all
now
that
my
lord
the
king
has
come
to
his
house
in
peace
31
Then
Barzillai
the
Gileadite
came
down
from
Rogelim
to
the
Jordan
to
escort
the
king
to
the
Jordan
32
Barzillai
was
very
old
80
years
of
age
and
he
supplied
the
king
with
food
while
he
was
staying
in
Mahanaim
for
he
was
a
very
wealthy
man
33
So
the
king
said
to
Barzillai
Cross
over
with
me
and
I
will
supply
you
with
food
in
Jerusalem
34
But
Barzillai
said
to
the
king
How
many
days
of
my
life
are
left
that
I
should
go
up
with
the
king
to
Jerusalem
35
I
am
80
years
old
today
Can
I
discern
between
good
and
bad
Can
I
your
servant
taste
what
I
eat
and
drink
Can
I
still
listen
to
the
voice
of
male
and
female
singers
So
why
should
your
servant
be
an
added
burden
to
my
lord
the
king
36
It
is
enough
that
your
servant
could
bring
the
king
to
the
Jordan
Why
should
the
king
repay
me
with
this
reward
37
Let
your
servant
return
please
and
let
me
die
in
my
city
near
the
burial
place
of
my
father
and
my
mother
But
here
is
your
servant
Chimham
Let
him
cross
over
with
my
lord
the
king
and
you
may
do
for
him
what
seems
good
to
you
38
So
the
king
said
Chimham
will
go
across
with
me
and
I
will
do
for
him
what
seems
good
to
you
whatever
you
ask
of
me
I
will
do
for
you
39
All
the
people
now
began
to
cross
the
Jordan
and
when
the
king
crossed
the
king
kissed
Barzillai
and
blessed
him
and
Barzillai
returned
home
40
When
the
king
went
across
to
Gilgal
Chimham
crossed
with
him
All
the
people
of
Judah
and
half
the
people
of
Israel
brought
the
king
across
41
Then
all
the
men
of
Israel
approached
the
king
and
said
to
him
Why
did
our
brothers
the
men
of
Judah
steal
you
away
and
bring
the
king
and
his
household
over
the
Jordan
along
with
all
of
Davids
men
42
All
the
men
of
Judah
answered
the
men
of
Israel
Because
the
king
is
related
to
us
Why
are
you
angry
over
this
Have
we
eaten
anything
at
the
kings
expense
or
has
a
gift
been
given
to
us
43
However
the
men
of
Israel
answered
the
men
of
Judah
We
have
ten
parts
in
the
king
so
that
we
have
a
greater
claim
in
David
than
you
have
Why
then
have
you
treated
us
with
contempt
Should
we
not
have
been
first
to
bring
our
king
back
But
the
word
of
the
men
of
Judah
prevailed
over
that
of
the
men
of
Israel
1
Now
there
was
a
troublemaker
named
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
a
Benjaminite
He
blew
the
horn
and
said
We
have
no
share
in
David
and
we
have
no
inheritance
in
the
son
of
Jesse
Everyone
to
his
gods
O
Israel
2
At
that
all
the
men
of
Israel
quit
following
David
to
follow
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
but
the
men
of
Judah
stuck
to
their
king
from
the
Jordan
to
Jerusalem
3
When
David
came
to
his
house
at
Jerusalem
the
king
took
the
ten
concubines
he
had
left
behind
to
take
care
of
the
house
and
he
put
them
in
a
house
under
guard
He
supplied
food
to
them
but
he
did
not
have
any
relations
with
them
They
remained
in
confinement
until
the
day
of
their
death
living
as
if
they
were
widows
even
though
they
had
a
living
husband
4
The
king
now
said
to
Amasa
Call
the
men
of
Judah
together
to
me
within
three
days
and
you
also
should
be
here
5
So
Amasa
went
to
call
Judah
together
but
he
came
later
than
the
set
time
that
had
been
appointed
for
him
6
Then
David
said
to
Abishai
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
may
do
us
more
harm
than
Absalom
did
Take
the
servants
of
your
lord
and
chase
after
him
so
that
he
may
not
find
fortified
cities
and
escape
from
us
7
So
the
men
of
Joab
the
Cherethites
the
Pelethites
and
all
the
mighty
men
went
out
after
him
they
left
Jerusalem
to
chase
after
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
8
When
they
were
near
the
great
stone
in
Gibeon
Amasa
came
to
meet
them
Now
Joab
was
wearing
his
battle
clothing
and
he
had
a
sword
in
its
sheath
strapped
to
his
hip
When
he
stepped
forward
the
sword
fell
out
9
Joab
said
to
Amasa
Are
you
all
right
my
brother
Then
with
his
right
hand
Joab
took
hold
of
Amasas
beard
as
if
to
kiss
him
10
Amasa
was
not
on
guard
against
the
sword
that
was
in
Joabs
hand
and
Joab
stabbed
him
with
it
in
the
abdomen
and
his
intestines
spilled
out
on
the
ground
He
did
not
have
to
stab
him
again
once
was
enough
to
kill
him
Then
Joab
and
his
brother
Abishai
chased
after
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
11
One
of
Joabs
young
men
stood
by
him
and
was
saying
Whoever
is
on
Joabs
side
and
whoever
belongs
to
David
let
him
follow
Joab
12
All
the
while
Amasa
was
wallowing
in
his
blood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
When
the
man
saw
that
all
the
people
were
stopping
he
moved
Amasa
from
the
road
to
the
field
Then
he
threw
a
garment
over
him
because
he
saw
that
everyone
was
stopping
when
they
came
up
to
him
13
After
he
had
removed
him
from
the
road
all
the
men
followed
Joab
to
chase
after
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
14
Sheba
passed
through
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
to
Abel
of
Beth-maacah
The
Bichrites
gathered
together
and
also
went
in
after
him
15
Joab
and
his
men
came
and
besieged
him
in
Abel
of
Beth-maacah
and
raised
up
a
siege
rampart
against
the
city
as
it
was
standing
within
a
rampart
And
all
the
men
with
Joab
were
undermining
the
wall
to
knock
it
down
16
And
a
wise
woman
called
out
from
the
city
Listen
men
listen
Please
tell
Joab
Come
here
and
let
me
speak
to
you
17
So
he
went
near
to
her
and
the
woman
said
Are
you
Joab
He
replied
I
am
At
this
she
said
to
him
Listen
to
the
words
of
your
servant
He
said
I
am
listening
18
She
continued
They
would
always
say
in
the
past
Let
them
inquire
in
Abel
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
19
I
represent
the
peaceable
and
faithful
ones
of
Israel
You
are
seeking
to
destroy
a
city
that
is
like
a
mother
in
Israel
Why
should
you
do
away
with
the
inheritance
of
Jehovah
20
Joab
answered
It
is
unthinkable
for
me
to
do
away
with
it
and
destroy
it
21
That
is
not
the
case
at
all
Rather
a
man
named
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
from
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
has
rebelled
against
King
David
If
you
hand
over
this
one
man
I
will
withdraw
from
the
city
Then
the
woman
said
to
Joab
Look
His
head
will
be
thrown
over
the
wall
to
you
22
At
once
the
wise
woman
went
in
to
all
the
people
and
they
cut
off
the
head
of
Sheba
the
son
of
Bichri
and
threw
it
to
Joab
At
that
he
blew
the
horn
and
they
dispersed
from
the
city
each
one
to
his
home
and
Joab
returned
to
Jerusalem
to
the
king
23
Now
Joab
was
in
charge
of
all
the
army
of
Israel
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
over
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites
24
Adoram
was
over
those
conscripted
for
forced
labor
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Ahilud
was
the
recorder
25
Sheva
was
the
secretary
Zadok
and
Abiathar
were
priests
26
And
Ira
the
Jairite
also
became
a
chief
minister
for
David
1
Now
there
was
a
famine
in
the
days
of
David
for
three
consecutive
years
so
David
consulted
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
said
There
is
bloodguilt
on
Saul
and
on
his
house
because
he
put
the
Gibeonites
to
death
2
So
the
king
called
the
Gibeonites
and
spoke
to
them
Incidentally
the
Gibeonites
were
not
Israelites
but
Amorites
who
remained
and
the
Israelites
had
sworn
to
spare
them
but
Saul
sought
to
strike
them
down
in
his
zeal
for
the
people
of
Israel
and
Judah
3
David
said
to
the
Gibeonites
What
should
I
do
for
you
and
how
can
I
make
atonement
so
that
you
will
bless
the
inheritance
of
Jehovah
4
The
Gibeonites
said
to
him
It
is
not
a
matter
of
silver
or
gold
for
us
in
connection
with
Saul
and
his
household
nor
can
we
put
any
man
to
death
in
Israel
At
that
he
said
Whatever
you
say
I
will
do
for
you
5
They
said
to
the
king
The
man
who
exterminated
us
and
schemed
to
annihilate
us
from
living
anywhere
in
the
territory
of
Israel—
6
let
seven
of
his
sons
be
given
to
us
We
will
hang
their
dead
bodies
before
Jehovah
in
Gibeah
of
Saul
the
chosen
one
of
Jehovah
The
king
then
said
I
will
hand
them
over
7
However
the
king
showed
compassion
for
Mephibosheth
the
son
of
Jonathan
the
son
of
Saul
because
of
the
oath
made
before
Jehovah
between
David
and
Jonathan
the
son
of
Saul
8
So
the
king
took
Armoni
and
Mephibosheth
the
two
sons
of
Rizpah
the
daughter
of
Aiah
whom
she
bore
to
Saul
and
the
five
sons
of
Michal
the
daughter
of
Saul
whom
she
bore
to
Adriel
the
son
of
Barzillai
the
Meholathite
9
Then
he
handed
them
over
to
the
Gibeonites
and
they
hung
their
dead
bodies
on
the
mountain
before
Jehovah
All
seven
of
them
died
together
they
were
put
to
death
in
the
first
days
of
harvest
at
the
start
of
the
barley
harvest
10
Then
Rizpah
the
daughter
of
Aiah
took
sackcloth
and
spread
it
out
on
the
rock
from
the
start
of
harvest
until
rain
poured
down
from
the
heavens
on
the
bodies
she
did
not
allow
the
birds
of
the
heavens
to
land
on
them
by
day
nor
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
to
come
near
by
night
11
David
was
told
what
Sauls
concubine
Rizpah
the
daughter
of
Aiah
had
done
12
So
David
went
and
took
the
bones
of
Saul
and
the
bones
of
his
son
Jonathan
from
the
leaders
of
Jabesh-gilead
who
had
stolen
them
from
the
public
square
of
Beth-shan
where
the
Philistines
had
hung
them
on
the
day
that
the
Philistines
struck
down
Saul
on
Gilboa
13
He
brought
the
bones
of
Saul
and
the
bones
of
his
son
Jonathan
up
from
there
and
they
also
gathered
the
bones
of
the
men
who
had
been
executed
14
Then
they
buried
the
bones
of
Saul
and
of
Jonathan
his
son
in
the
land
of
Benjamin
in
Zela
in
the
tomb
of
Kish
his
father
After
they
did
everything
that
the
king
had
commanded
God
listened
to
their
entreaties
for
the
land
15
Once
again
there
was
war
between
the
Philistines
and
Israel
So
David
and
his
servants
went
down
and
fought
the
Philistines
but
David
became
exhausted
16
A
descendant
of
the
Rephaim
named
Ishbi-benob
whose
copper
spear
weighed
300
shekels
and
who
was
armed
with
a
new
sword
intended
to
strike
David
down
17
At
once
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
came
to
his
aid
and
struck
the
Philistine
down
and
put
him
to
death
At
that
time
the
men
of
David
swore
this
oath
to
him
You
must
not
go
out
with
us
to
battle
anymore
You
must
not
extinguish
the
lamp
of
Israel
18
After
this
war
broke
out
again
with
the
Philistines
at
Gob
At
that
time
Sibbecai
the
Hushathite
struck
down
Saph
who
was
a
descendant
of
the
Rephaim
19
And
war
broke
out
again
with
the
Philistines
at
Gob
and
Elhanan
the
son
of
Jaare-oregim
the
Bethlehemite
struck
down
Goliath
the
Gittite
whose
spear
had
a
shaft
like
the
beam
of
loom
workers
20
War
broke
out
yet
again
at
Gath
where
there
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
size
with
6
fingers
on
each
hand
and
6
toes
on
each
foot
24
in
all
and
he
too
was
a
descendant
of
the
Rephaim
21
He
kept
taunting
Israel
So
Jonathan
the
son
of
Shimei
Davids
brother
struck
him
down
22
These
four
were
descendants
of
the
Rephaim
in
Gath
and
they
fell
by
the
hand
of
David
and
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
1
And
David
spoke
to
Jehovah
the
words
of
this
song
in
the
day
that
Jehovah
rescued
him
out
of
the
hand
of
all
his
enemies
and
out
of
Sauls
hand
2
He
said
Jehovah
is
my
crag
and
my
stronghold
and
the
One
who
rescues
me

3
My
God
is
my
rock
in
whom
I
take
refuge
My
shield
and
my
horn
of
salvation
my
secure
refugeAnd
my
place
to
flee
my
savior
you
who
save
me
from
violence

4
I
call
on
Jehovah
who
is
worthy
of
praise
And
I
will
be
saved
from
my
enemies

5
The
waves
of
death
broke
all
around
me
Flash
floods
of
worthless
men
terrified
me

6
The
ropes
of
the
Grave
surrounded
me
The
snares
of
death
confronted
me

7
In
my
distress
I
called
on
Jehovah
To
my
God
I
kept
calling
Then
from
his
temple
he
heard
my
voice
And
my
cry
for
help
reached
his
ears

8
Back
and
forth
the
earth
began
to
shake
and
rock
The
foundations
of
the
heavens
trembledAnd
shook
back
and
forth
because
he
had
been
angered

9
Smoke
ascended
from
his
nostrils
And
a
consuming
fire
came
from
his
mouth
Glowing
coals
blazed
from
him
10
He
made
the
heavens
bend
as
he
descended
And
thick
gloom
was
beneath
his
feet
11
He
rode
on
a
cherub
and
came
flying
He
was
visible
on
the
wings
of
a
spirit
12
Then
he
put
darkness
around
him
as
a
shelter
In
dark
waters
and
thick
clouds
13
From
the
brightness
before
him
fiery
coals
blazed
14
Then
Jehovah
began
to
thunder
from
heaven
The
Most
High
made
his
voice
heard
15
He
shot
his
arrows
and
scattered
them
Lightning
and
he
threw
them
into
confusion
16
The
bed
of
the
sea
became
visible
The
foundations
of
the
land
were
exposed
by
the
rebuke
of
Jehovah
By
the
blast
of
the
breath
from
his
nostrils
17
He
reached
down
from
on
high
He
took
hold
of
me
and
pulled
me
from
deep
waters
18
He
rescued
me
from
my
strong
enemy
From
those
hating
me
who
were
stronger
than
I
was
19
They
confronted
me
on
the
day
of
my
disaster
But
Jehovah
was
my
support
20
He
brought
me
out
into
a
place
of
safety
He
rescued
me
because
he
was
pleased
with
me
21
Jehovah
rewards
me
according
to
my
righteousness
He
repays
me
according
to
the
innocence
of
my
hands
22
For
I
have
kept
the
ways
of
Jehovah
And
I
have
not
wickedly
abandoned
my
God
23
All
his
judgments
are
before
me
I
will
not
deviate
from
his
statutes
24
I
will
remain
blameless
before
him
And
I
will
keep
myself
from
error
25
May
Jehovah
repay
me
according
to
my
righteousness
According
to
my
innocence
before
him
26
With
someone
loyal
you
act
in
loyalty
With
the
blameless
mighty
man
you
deal
blamelessly
27
With
the
pure
you
show
yourself
pure
But
with
the
crooked
you
show
yourself
shrewd
28
For
you
save
those
who
are
humble
But
your
eyes
are
against
the
haughty
and
you
abase
them
29
For
you
are
my
lamp
O
Jehovah
It
is
Jehovah
who
lights
up
my
darkness
30
With
your
help
I
can
charge
against
a
marauder
band
By
Gods
power
I
can
scale
a
wall
31
The
way
of
the
true
God
is
perfect
The
saying
of
Jehovah
is
refined
He
is
a
shield
to
all
those
taking
refuge
in
him
32
For
who
is
a
God
besides
Jehovah
And
who
is
a
rock
except
our
God
33
The
true
God
is
my
strong
fortress
And
he
will
make
my
way
perfect
34
He
makes
my
feet
like
those
of
a
deer
He
makes
me
stand
on
high
places
35
He
trains
my
hands
for
warfare
My
arms
can
bend
a
bow
of
copper
36
You
give
me
your
shield
of
salvation
And
your
humility
makes
me
great
37
You
widen
the
path
for
my
footsteps
My
feet
will
not
slip
38
I
will
pursue
my
enemies
and
annihilate
them
I
will
not
return
until
they
are
wiped
out
39
And
I
will
wipe
them
out
and
crush
them
so
that
they
will
not
rise
up
They
will
fall
under
my
feet
40
You
will
equip
me
with
strength
for
the
battle
You
will
make
my
foes
collapse
under
me
41
You
will
make
my
enemies
retreat
from
me
I
will
put
an
end
to
those
who
hate
me
42
They
cry
for
help
but
there
is
no
one
to
save
them
They
even
cry
to
Jehovah
but
he
does
not
answer
them
43
I
will
pound
them
as
fine
as
the
dust
of
the
earth
I
will
pulverize
and
trample
them
like
mud
in
the
streets
44
You
will
rescue
me
from
the
faultfinding
of
my
people
You
will
safeguard
me
to
be
the
head
of
nations
A
people
whom
I
have
not
known
will
serve
me
45
Foreigners
will
come
cringing
before
me
What
they
hear
about
me
will
make
them
obey
me
46
Foreigners
will
lose
courage
They
will
come
trembling
from
their
strongholds
47
Jehovah
is
alive
Praised
be
my
Rock
Let
the
God
of
the
rock
of
my
salvation
be
exalted
48
The
true
God
executes
vengeance
for
me
He
subdues
the
peoples
under
me
49
He
rescues
me
from
my
enemies
You
lift
me
high
above
those
who
attack
me
You
save
me
from
the
man
of
violence
50
That
is
why
I
will
thank
you
O
Jehovah
among
the
nations
And
to
your
name
I
will
sing
praises
51
He
performs
great
acts
of
salvation
for
his
king
He
displays
loyal
love
to
his
anointed
one
To
David
and
his
offspring
forever
1
These
are
the
last
words
of
David
The
word
of
David
the
son
of
Jesse
And
the
word
of
the
man
who
was
raised
on
high
The
anointed
of
the
God
of
Jacob
The
pleasant
singer
of
the
songs
of
Israel

2
The
spirit
of
Jehovah
spoke
through
me
His
word
was
on
my
tongue

3
The
God
of
Israel
spoke
To
me
the
Rock
of
Israel
said
When
the
one
ruling
over
mankind
is
righteous
Ruling
in
the
fear
of
God
4
It
is
like
the
morning
light
when
the
sun
shines
A
morning
without
clouds
It
is
like
the
brightness
after
the
rain
Making
grass
sprout
from
the
earth

5
Is
not
my
house
like
that
before
God
For
he
has
made
an
eternal
covenant
with
me
Arranged
in
every
detail
and
secured
Because
it
means
my
complete
salvation
and
all
my
delight
Is
that
not
why
he
makes
it
flourish

6
But
worthless
men
are
all
thrown
away
like
thornbushes
For
they
cannot
be
taken
with
the
hand

7
When
a
man
touches
them
He
should
be
fully
armed
with
iron
and
the
shaft
of
a
spear
And
they
should
be
completely
burned
up
with
fire
in
their
place
8
These
are
the
names
of
Davids
mighty
warriors
Josheb-basshebeth
a
Tahchemonite
the
head
of
the
three
He
brandished
his
spear
over
800
slain
at
one
time
9
Next
to
him
Eleazar
the
son
of
Dodo
the
son
of
Ahohi
was
among
the
three
mighty
warriors
with
David
when
they
taunted
the
Philistines
They
had
gathered
there
for
the
battle
and
when
the
men
of
Israel
retreated
10
he
stood
his
ground
and
kept
striking
down
the
Philistines
until
his
arm
grew
weary
and
his
hand
became
stiff
from
gripping
the
sword
So
Jehovah
brought
about
a
great
victory
on
that
day
and
the
people
returned
behind
him
to
strip
the
slain
11
Next
to
him
was
Shammah
the
son
of
Agee
the
Hararite
The
Philistines
gathered
together
at
Lehi
where
there
was
a
plot
of
land
full
of
lentils
and
the
people
fled
because
of
the
Philistines
12
But
he
took
his
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
field
and
defended
it
and
kept
striking
down
the
Philistines
so
that
Jehovah
brought
about
a
great
victory
13
Three
of
the
30
headmen
went
down
during
the
harvest
to
David
at
the
cave
of
Adullam
and
a
company
of
the
Philistines
was
camped
in
the
Valley
of
Rephaim
14
David
was
then
in
the
stronghold
and
an
outpost
of
the
Philistines
was
in
Bethlehem
15
Then
David
expressed
his
longing
If
only
I
could
have
a
drink
of
the
water
from
the
cistern
by
the
gate
of
Bethlehem
16
At
that
the
three
mighty
warriors
forced
their
way
into
the
camp
of
the
Philistines
and
drew
water
from
the
cistern
by
the
gate
of
Bethlehem
and
brought
it
to
David
but
he
refused
to
drink
it
and
poured
it
out
to
Jehovah
17
He
said
It
is
unthinkable
on
my
part
O
Jehovah
that
I
should
do
this
Should
I
drink
the
blood
of
the
men
going
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
So
he
refused
to
drink
it
These
are
the
things
that
his
three
mighty
warriors
did
18
Abishai
the
brother
of
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
was
the
head
of
another
three
he
brandished
his
spear
over
300
slain
and
he
had
a
reputation
like
the
three
19
Although
he
was
the
most
distinguished
of
the
other
three
and
he
was
their
chief
he
did
not
attain
to
the
rank
of
the
first
three
20
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
a
courageous
man
who
performed
many
exploits
in
Kabzeel
He
struck
down
the
two
sons
of
Ariel
of
Moab
and
he
descended
into
a
waterpit
on
a
snowy
day
and
killed
a
lion
21
He
also
struck
down
an
Egyptian
man
of
extraordinary
size
Though
the
Egyptian
had
a
spear
in
his
hand
he
went
against
him
with
a
rod
and
snatched
the
spear
away
from
the
Egyptians
hand
and
killed
him
with
his
own
spear
22
These
things
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
did
and
he
had
a
reputation
like
that
of
the
three
mighty
warriors
23
Although
he
was
distinguished
even
more
than
the
thirty
he
did
not
attain
to
the
rank
of
the
three
However
David
appointed
him
over
his
own
bodyguard
24
Asahel
the
brother
of
Joab
was
among
the
thirty
Elhanan
the
son
of
Dodo
of
Bethlehem
25
Shammah
the
Harodite
Elika
the
Harodite
26
Helez
the
Paltite
Ira
the
son
of
Ikkesh
the
Tekoite
27
Abi-ezer
the
Anathothite
Mebunnai
the
Hushathite
28
Zalmon
the
Ahohite
Maharai
the
Netophathite
29
Heleb
the
son
of
Baanah
the
Netophathite
Ittai
the
son
of
Ribai
of
Gibeah
of
the
Benjaminites
30
Benaiah
a
Pirathonite
Hiddai
of
the
wadis
of
Gaash
31
Abi-albon
the
Arbathite
Azmaveth
the
Bar-humite
32
Eliahba
the
Shaalbonite
the
sons
of
Jashen
Jonathan
33
Shammah
the
Hararite
Ahiam
the
son

Sharar
the
Hararite
34
Eliphelet
the
son

Ahasbai
the
son

the
Maacathite
Eliam
the
son
of
Ahithophel
the
Gilonite
35
Hezro
the
Carmelite
Paarai

Arbite
36
Igal
the
son
of
Nathan
of
Zobah
Bani
the
Gadite
37
Zelek
the
Ammonite
Naharai
the
Beerothite
the
armor-bearer
of
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
38
Ira
the
Ithrite
Gareb
the
Ithrite
39
and
Uriah
the
Hittite—37
in
all
1
The
anger
of
Jehovah
again
blazed
against
Israel
when
one
incited
David
against
them
saying
Go
take
a
count
of
Israel
and
Judah
2
So
the
king
said
to
Joab
the
chief
of
the
army
who
was
with
him
Please
go
through
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
from
Dan
to
Beer-sheba
and
register
the
people
so
that
I
may
know
the
number
of
the
people
3
But
Joab
said
to
the
king
May
Jehovah
your
God
multiply
the
people
100
times
and
may
the
eyes
of
my
lord
the
king
see
it
but
why
does
my
lord
the
king
want
to
do
such
a
thing
4
But
the
kings
word
prevailed
over
Joab
and
the
chiefs
of
the
army
So
Joab
and
the
chiefs
of
the
army
went
out
from
before
the
king
to
register
the
people
of
Israel
5
They
crossed
the
Jordan
and
camped
at
Aroer
to
the
right
of
the
city
in
the
middle
of
the
valley
toward
the
Gadites
and
on
to
Jazer
6
After
that
they
went
on
to
Gilead
and
the
land
of
Tahtim-hodshi
and
continued
to
Dan-jaan
and
went
around
to
Sidon
7
Then
they
went
to
the
fortress
of
Tyre
and
all
the
cities
of
the
Hivites
and
of
the
Canaanites
and
finally
they
ended
up
in
the
Negeb
of
Judah
at
Beer-sheba
8
Thus
they
went
through
all
the
land
and
came
to
Jerusalem
at
the
end
of
nine
months
and
20
days
9
Joab
now
gave
to
the
king
the
number
of
the
people
who
were
registered
Israel
amounted
to
800000
warriors
armed
with
swords
and
the
men
of
Judah
were
500000
10
But
Davids
heart
was
struck
with
remorse
after
he
had
numbered
the
people
David
then
said
to
Jehovah
I
have
sinned
greatly
by
doing
this
And
now
Jehovah
please
forgive
your
servants
error
for
I
have
acted
very
foolishly
11
When
David
got
up
in
the
morning
Jehovahs
word
came
to
Gad
the
prophet
Davids
visionary
saying
12
Go
and
say
to
David
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
am
giving
you
three
options
Choose
the
one
that
I
should
bring
on
you
13
So
Gad
came
in
to
David
and
told
him
Should
seven
years
of
famine
come
on
your
land
Or
should
you
flee
for
three
months
from
your
adversaries
while
they
pursue
you
Or
should
there
be
three
days
of
pestilence
in
your
land
Now
consider
carefully
what
I
should
reply
to
the
One
who
sent
me
14
So
David
said
to
Gad
It
is
very
distressing
to
me
Let
us
fall
please
into
the
hand
of
Jehovah
for
his
mercy
is
great
but
do
not
let
me
fall
into
the
hand
of
man
15
Then
Jehovah
sent
a
pestilence
on
Israel
from
the
morning
until
the
designated
time
so
that
70000
of
the
people
from
Dan
to
Beer-sheba
died
16
When
the
angel
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
Jerusalem
to
destroy
it
Jehovah
felt
regret
over
the
calamity
and
he
said
to
the
angel
bringing
destruction
among
the
people
It
is
enough
Now
let
your
hand
drop
Jehovahs
angel
was
close
to
the
threshing
floor
of
Araunah
the
Jebusite
17
When
David
saw
the
angel
who
was
striking
the
people
down
he
said
to
Jehovah
I
am
the
one
who
sinned
and
I
am
the
one
who
did
wrong
but
these
sheep—what
have
they
done
Let
your
hand
please
come
against
me
and
my
fathers
house
18
So
Gad
came
in
to
David
on
that
day
and
said
to
him
Go
up
set
up
for
Jehovah
an
altar
on
the
threshing
floor
of
Araunah
the
Jebusite
19
So
David
went
up
at
the
word
of
Gad
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
20
When
Araunah
looked
down
and
saw
the
king
and
his
servants
coming
toward
him
Araunah
immediately
went
out
and
bowed
down
to
the
king
with
his
face
to
the
ground
21
Araunah
asked
Why
has
my
lord
the
king
come
to
his
servant
David
replied
To
buy
from
you
the
threshing
floor
in
order
to
build
an
altar
to
Jehovah
so
that
the
scourge
against
the
people
may
be
halted
22
But
Araunah
said
to
David
Let
my
lord
the
king
take
it
and
offer
up
what
seems
good
to
him
Here
are
cattle
for
the
burnt
offering
and
the
threshing
sledge
and
the
equipment
of
the
cattle
for
the
wood
23
All
of
this
O
king
Araunah
gives
to
the
king
Then
Araunah
said
to
the
king
May
Jehovah
your
God
show
you
favor
24
However
the
king
said
to
Araunah
No
I
must
buy
it
from
you
for
a
price
I
will
not
offer
up
to
Jehovah
my
God
burnt
sacrifices
that
cost
me
nothing
So
David
bought
the
threshing
floor
and
the
cattle
for
50
silver
shekels
25
And
David
built
an
altar
there
to
Jehovah
and
offered
up
burnt
sacrifices
and
communion
sacrifices
Jehovah
then
responded
to
the
entreaty
for
the
land
and
the
scourge
against
Israel
was
halted
1
Now
King
David
was
old
advanced
in
years
and
although
they
would
cover
him
with
garments
he
could
not
get
warm
2
So
his
servants
said
to
him
Let
a
girl
a
virgin
be
found
for
my
lord
the
king
and
she
will
wait
on
the
king
as
his
nurse
She
will
lie
in
your
arms
so
that
my
lord
the
king
may
feel
warm
3
They
searched
throughout
all
the
territory
of
Israel
for
a
beautiful
girl
and
they
found
Abishag
the
Shunammite
and
brought
her
in
to
the
king
4
The
girl
was
extremely
beautiful
and
she
became
the
kings
nurse
and
waited
on
him
but
the
king
did
not
have
sexual
relations
with
her
5
Meanwhile
Adonijah
the
son
of
Haggith
was
exalting
himself
saying
I
am
going
to
be
king
He
had
a
chariot
made
for
himself
with
horsemen
and
50
men
to
run
before
him
6
But
his
father
had
never
confronted
him
by
saying
Why
have
you
done
this
He
was
also
very
handsome
and
his
mother
had
given
birth
to
him
after
Absalom
7
He
conferred
with
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
and
Abiathar
the
priest
and
they
offered
Adonijah
help
and
support
8
But
Zadok
the
priest
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
Nathan
the
prophet
Shimei
Rei
and
Davids
mighty
warriors
did
not
support
Adonijah
9
Eventually
Adonijah
held
a
sacrifice
of
sheep
cattle
and
fattened
animals
by
the
stone
of
Zoheleth
which
is
near
En-rogel
and
he
invited
all
his
brothers
the
kings
sons
and
all
the
men
of
Judah
the
kings
servants
10
But
he
did
not
invite
Nathan
the
prophet
Benaiah
and
the
mighty
warriors
or
Solomon
his
brother
11
Nathan
then
said
to
Bath-sheba
Solomons
mother
Have
you
not
heard
that
Adonijah
the
son
of
Haggith
has
become
king
and
our
lord
David
does
not
know
anything
about
it
12
So
now
come
please
and
let
me
advise
you
so
that
you
may
save
your
own
life
and
the
life
of
your
son
Solomon
13
Go
in
to
King
David
and
say
to
him
Was
it
not
you
my
lord
the
king
who
swore
to
your
servant
saying
Your
son
Solomon
will
become
king
after
me
and
he
is
the
one
who
will
sit
on
my
throne
So
why
has
Adonijah
become
king
14
While
you
are
still
there
speaking
with
the
king
I
will
come
in
after
you
and
confirm
your
words
15
So
Bath-sheba
went
in
to
the
king
into
his
private
room
The
king
was
very
old
and
Abishag
the
Shunammite
was
waiting
on
the
king
16
Then
Bath-sheba
bowed
low
and
prostrated
herself
to
the
king
and
the
king
said
What
is
your
request
17
She
replied
My
lord
it
was
you
who
swore
by
Jehovah
your
God
to
your
servant
Your
son
Solomon
will
become
king
after
me
and
he
is
the
one
who
will
sit
on
my
throne
18
But
look
Adonijah
has
become
king
and
my
lord
the
king
does
not
know
anything
about
it
19
He
sacrificed
bulls
fattened
animals
and
sheep
in
great
quantity
and
invited
all
the
sons
of
the
king
and
Abiathar
the
priest
and
Joab
the
chief
of
the
army
but
he
did
not
invite
your
servant
Solomon
20
And
now
my
lord
the
king
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
are
upon
you
to
tell
them
who
will
sit
on
the
throne
of
my
lord
the
king
after
him
21
Otherwise
as
soon
as
my
lord
the
king
is
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
I
and
also
my
son
Solomon
will
be
considered
traitors
22
And
while
she
was
still
speaking
to
the
king
Nathan
the
prophet
came
in
23
At
once
the
king
was
told
Here
is
Nathan
the
prophet
He
came
in
before
the
king
and
prostrated
himself
to
the
king
with
his
face
to
the
ground
24
Then
Nathan
said
My
lord
the
king
did
you
say
Adonijah
will
become
king
after
me
and
he
is
the
one
who
will
sit
on
my
throne
25
For
today
he
has
gone
down
to
sacrifice
bulls
fattened
animals
and
sheep
in
great
quantity
and
he
has
invited
all
the
sons
of
the
king
and
the
chiefs
of
the
army
and
Abiathar
the
priest
They
are
there
eating
and
drinking
with
him
and
they
keep
saying
Long
live
King
Adonijah
26
But
he
did
not
invite
me
your
servant
or
Zadok
the
priest
or
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
or
your
servant
Solomon
27
Has
my
lord
the
king
authorized
this
without
telling
your
servant
who
should
sit
on
the
throne
of
my
lord
the
king
after
him
28
King
David
now
answered
Call
Bath-sheba
for
me
At
that
she
came
in
and
stood
before
the
king
29
The
king
then
swore
an
oath
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
the
one
who
rescued
me
out
of
all
distress
30
just
as
I
swore
to
you
by
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
saying
Your
son
Solomon
will
become
king
after
me
and
he
is
the
one
who
will
sit
on
my
throne
in
my
place
that
is
what
I
will
bring
about
this
day
31
Then
Bath-sheba
bowed
low
with
her
face
to
the
ground
and
prostrated
herself
to
the
king
and
said
May
my
lord
King
David
live
forever
32
Immediately
King
David
said
Call
for
me
Zadok
the
priest
Nathan
the
prophet
and
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
So
they
came
in
before
the
king
33
The
king
said
to
them
Take
with
you
the
servants
of
your
lord
and
have
my
son
Solomon
ride
on
my
own
mule
and
lead
him
down
to
Gihon
34
Zadok
the
priest
and
Nathan
the
prophet
will
anoint
him
there
as
king
over
Israel
then
blow
the
horn
and
say
Long
live
King
Solomon
35
Then
follow
him
back
and
he
will
come
in
and
sit
on
my
throne
and
he
will
be
king
in
my
place
and
I
will
commission
him
as
leader
over
Israel
and
over
Judah
36
At
once
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
said
to
the
king
Amen
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
my
lord
the
king
confirm
it
37
Just
as
Jehovah
was
with
my
lord
the
king
so
let
him
be
with
Solomon
and
may
He
make
his
throne
greater
than
the
throne
of
my
lord
King
David
38
Then
Zadok
the
priest
Nathan
the
prophet
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
and
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites
went
down
and
had
Solomon
ride
on
the
mule
of
King
David
and
they
brought
him
to
Gihon
39
Zadok
the
priest
now
took
the
horn
of
oil
out
of
the
tent
and
anointed
Solomon
and
they
began
to
blow
the
horn
and
all
the
people
began
shouting
Long
live
King
Solomon
40
After
that
all
the
people
followed
him
and
went
up
playing
flutes
and
rejoicing
greatly
so
that
the
earth
was
split
open
by
their
noise
41
Adonijah
and
all
those
invited
by
him
heard
it
when
they
had
finished
eating
As
soon
as
Joab
heard
the
sound
of
the
horn
he
said
Why
is
there
such
a
noisy
uproar
in
the
city
42
While
he
was
still
speaking
Jonathan
the
son
of
Abiathar
the
priest
came
Then
Adonijah
said
Come
in
for
you
are
a
good
man
and
you
must
bring
good
news
43
But
Jonathan
answered
Adonijah
No
Our
lord
King
David
has
made
Solomon
king
44
The
king
sent
with
him
Zadok
the
priest
Nathan
the
prophet
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
and
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites
and
they
had
him
ride
on
the
mule
of
the
king
45
Then
Zadok
the
priest
and
Nathan
the
prophet
anointed
him
as
king
in
Gihon
After
that
they
came
up
from
there
rejoicing
and
the
city
is
in
an
uproar
That
was
the
noise
that
you
heard
46
Moreover
Solomon
has
sat
down
on
the
royal
throne
47
Another
thing
the
servants
of
the
king
have
come
in
to
congratulate
our
lord
King
David
saying
May
your
God
make
Solomons
name
more
splendid
than
your
name
and
may
He
make
his
throne
greater
than
your
throne
At
that
the
king
bowed
down
on
the
bed
48
And
the
king
also
said
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
be
praised
who
today
has
granted
someone
to
sit
on
my
throne
and
has
allowed
my
own
eyes
to
see
it
49
And
all
those
invited
by
Adonijah
became
terrified
and
each
of
them
rose
up
and
went
his
own
way
50
Adonijah
was
also
afraid
because
of
Solomon
so
he
got
up
and
went
and
grabbed
hold
of
the
horns
of
the
altar
51
The
report
was
made
to
Solomon
Here
Adonijah
has
become
afraid
of
King
Solomon
and
he
has
taken
hold
of
the
horns
of
the
altar
saying
Let
King
Solomon
first
swear
to
me
that
he
will
not
put
his
servant
to
death
by
the
sword
52
To
this
Solomon
said
If
he
behaves
in
a
worthy
manner
not
a
single
hair
of
his
will
fall
to
the
ground
but
if
what
is
bad
is
found
in
him
he
will
have
to
die
53
So
King
Solomon
sent
for
him
to
be
brought
down
from
the
altar
Then
he
came
in
and
bowed
down
to
King
Solomon
after
which
Solomon
said
to
him
Go
to
your
own
house
1
When
the
time
of
Davids
death
drew
near
he
gave
his
son
Solomon
these
instructions
2
I
am
about
to
die
Therefore
be
strong
and
prove
yourself
a
man
3
You
must
keep
your
obligation
to
Jehovah
your
God
by
walking
in
his
ways
and
by
observing
his
statutes
his
commandments
his
judgments
and
his
reminders
as
they
are
written
in
the
Law
of
Moses
then
you
will
succeed
in
everything
you
do
and
everywhere
you
turn
4
And
Jehovah
will
carry
out
his
promise
that
he
made
concerning
me
If
your
sons
pay
attention
to
their
way
by
walking
faithfully
before
me
with
all
their
heart
and
soul
there
will
never
fail
to
be
a
man
of
your
line
sitting
on
the
throne
of
Israel
5
You
also
well
know
what
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
did
to
me
what
he
did
to
two
chiefs
of
the
armies
of
Israel—Abner
the
son
of
Ner
and
Amasa
the
son
of
Jether
He
killed
them
shedding
the
blood
of
war
in
peacetime
and
he
put
the
blood
of
war
on
the
belt
around
his
waist
and
on
the
sandals
on
his
feet
6
You
must
act
according
to
your
wisdom
and
not
let
his
gray
hairs
go
down
in
peace
to
the
Grave
7
But
toward
the
sons
of
Barzillai
the
Gileadite
you
should
show
loyal
love
and
they
should
be
among
those
eating
at
your
table
for
that
was
how
they
stood
by
me
when
I
ran
away
from
your
brother
Absalom
8
There
is
also
with
you
Shimei
the
son
of
Gera
the
Benjaminite
from
Bahurim
He
was
the
one
who
cursed
me
with
a
vicious
curse
on
the
day
that
I
was
going
to
Mahanaim
but
when
he
came
down
to
meet
me
at
the
Jordan
I
swore
to
him
by
Jehovah
I
will
not
put
you
to
death
by
the
sword
9
Now
do
not
leave
him
unpunished
for
you
are
a
wise
man
and
you
know
what
you
should
do
to
him
you
must
bring
his
gray
hairs
down
to
the
Grave
with
blood
10
Then
David
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
in
the
City
of
David
11
The
length
of
Davids
reign
over
Israel
was
40
years
In
Hebron
he
reigned
for
7
years
and
in
Jerusalem
he
reigned
for
33
years
12
Solomon
then
sat
down
on
the
throne
of
David
his
father
and
gradually
his
kingship
became
firmly
established
13
In
time
Adonijah
the
son
of
Haggith
came
to
Bath-sheba
Solomons
mother
She
asked
Is
your
coming
peaceable
He
replied
It
is
peaceable
14
He
then
said
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
So
she
said
Speak
15
He
continued
You
well
know
that
the
kingship
was
to
become
mine
and
all
Israel
expected
me
to
become
king
but
the
kingship
eluded
me
and
became
my
brothers
for
it
was
from
Jehovah
that
it
became
his
16
But
now
there
is
just
one
request
that
I
am
making
of
you
Do
not
turn
me
away
So
she
said
to
him
Speak
17
He
then
said
Please
ask
Solomon
the
king—for
he
will
not
turn
you
away—to
give
me
Abishag
the
Shunammite
as
a
wife
18
To
this
Bath-sheba
said
Very
well
I
will
speak
for
you
to
the
king
19
So
Bath-sheba
went
in
to
King
Solomon
to
speak
to
him
for
Adonijah
At
once
the
king
rose
to
meet
her
and
bowed
down
to
her
Then
he
sat
down
on
his
throne
and
had
a
throne
set
for
the
kings
mother
so
that
she
could
sit
at
his
right
20
She
then
said
There
is
one
small
request
that
I
am
making
of
you
Do
not
turn
me
away
So
the
king
said
to
her
Make
it
my
mother
for
I
will
not
turn
you
away
21
She
said
Let
Abishag
the
Shunammite
be
given
as
a
wife
to
your
brother
Adonijah
22
At
this
King
Solomon
answered
his
mother
Why
are
you
requesting
Abishag
the
Shunammite
for
Adonijah
You
may
as
well
request
the
kingship
for
him
for
he
is
my
older
brother
and
supporting
him
are
Abiathar
the
priest
and
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
23
With
that
King
Solomon
swore
by
Jehovah
So
may
God
do
to
me
and
add
to
it
if
it
was
not
at
the
cost
of
his
own
life
that
Adonijah
made
this
request
24
And
now
as
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
who
has
firmly
established
me
and
seated
me
on
the
throne
of
David
my
father
and
who
made
a
house
for
me
just
as
he
promised
Adonijah
will
be
put
to
death
today
25
King
Solomon
immediately
sent
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
who
went
out
and
struck
Adonijah
down
and
he
died
26
To
Abiathar
the
priest
the
king
said
Go
to
your
fields
in
Anathoth
You
deserve
to
die
but
on
this
day
I
will
not
put
you
to
death
because
you
carried
the
Ark
of
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
before
David
my
father
and
because
you
shared
in
all
the
hardships
that
my
father
suffered
27
So
Solomon
drove
Abiathar
out
from
serving
as
a
priest
of
Jehovah
to
fulfill
Jehovahs
word
against
the
house
of
Eli
in
Shiloh
28
When
the
news
reached
Joab—for
Joab
had
supported
Adonijah
but
he
had
not
supported
Absalom—Joab
fled
to
the
tent
of
Jehovah
and
grabbed
hold
of
the
horns
of
the
altar
29
Then
King
Solomon
was
told
Joab
has
fled
to
the
tent
of
Jehovah
and
he
is
there
beside
the
altar
So
Solomon
sent
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
saying
Go
strike
him
down
30
So
Benaiah
went
to
the
tent
of
Jehovah
and
said
to
him
This
is
what
the
king
says
Come
out
But
he
said
No
I
will
die
here
Benaiah
brought
word
back
to
the
king
This
is
what
Joab
said
and
this
is
what
he
answered
me
31
Then
the
king
said
to
him
Do
just
as
he
said
strike
him
down
and
bury
him
and
remove
from
me
and
from
the
house
of
my
father
the
blood
that
Joab
spilled
without
just
cause
32
Jehovah
will
bring
his
blood
back
on
his
own
head
for
without
my
father
Davids
knowledge
he
struck
down
and
killed
with
the
sword
two
men
more
righteous
and
better
than
he
was
Abner
the
son
of
Ner
the
chief
of
the
army
of
Israel
and
Amasa
the
son
of
Jether
the
chief
of
the
army
of
Judah
33
Their
blood
will
come
back
on
the
head
of
Joab
and
on
the
head
of
his
offspring
forever
but
for
David
his
offspring
his
house
and
his
throne
may
there
be
peace
from
Jehovah
forever
34
Then
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
went
up
and
struck
Joab
down
and
put
him
to
death
and
he
was
buried
at
his
own
house
in
the
wilderness
35
Then
the
king
appointed
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
over
the
army
in
his
place
and
the
king
appointed
Zadok
the
priest
in
place
of
Abiathar
36
Then
the
king
summoned
Shimei
and
said
to
him
Build
yourself
a
house
in
Jerusalem
and
live
there
do
not
go
out
from
there
to
any
other
place
37
On
the
day
you
go
out
and
cross
the
Kidron
Valley
you
can
be
sure
that
you
will
die
Your
blood
will
be
on
your
own
head
38
Shimei
replied
to
the
king
What
you
have
said
is
fair
Your
servant
will
do
just
as
my
lord
the
king
has
said
So
Shimei
stayed
in
Jerusalem
for
many
days
39
But
at
the
end
of
three
years
two
of
Shimeis
slaves
ran
away
to
Achish
the
son
of
Maacah
the
king
of
Gath
When
Shimei
was
told
Look
Your
slaves
are
in
Gath

40
Shimei
immediately
saddled
his
donkey
and
went
to
see
Achish
in
Gath
to
find
his
slaves
When
Shimei
returned
from
Gath
with
his
slaves
41
Solomon
was
told
Shimei
has
gone
out
of
Jerusalem
to
Gath
and
has
returned
42
At
that
the
king
summoned
Shimei
and
said
to
him
Did
I
not
put
you
under
oath
by
Jehovah
and
warn
you
On
the
day
you
go
out
from
here
to
any
other
place
you
can
be
sure
that
you
will
die
And
did
you
not
say
to
me
What
you
are
saying
is
fair
I
will
obey
43
Why
then
did
you
not
keep
the
oath
of
Jehovah
and
the
commandment
that
I
imposed
on
you
44
The
king
then
said
to
Shimei
You
know
in
your
heart
all
the
injury
that
you
did
to
David
my
father
and
Jehovah
will
bring
back
that
injury
on
your
own
head
45
But
King
Solomon
will
be
blessed
and
the
throne
of
David
will
be
firmly
established
before
Jehovah
forever
46
With
that
the
king
commanded
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
who
went
out
and
struck
him
down
and
he
died
Thus
the
kingdom
was
firmly
established
in
the
hand
of
Solomon
1
Solomon
made
a
marriage
alliance
with
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
He
married
Pharaohs
daughter
and
brought
her
to
the
City
of
David
until
he
finished
building
his
own
house
and
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
wall
around
Jerusalem
2
But
the
people
were
still
sacrificing
on
the
high
places
because
until
that
time
a
house
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
had
not
yet
been
built
3
Solomon
continued
to
love
Jehovah
by
walking
in
the
statutes
of
David
his
father
except
that
he
was
sacrificing
and
making
offerings
smoke
on
the
high
places
4
The
king
went
to
Gibeon
to
sacrifice
there
for
that
was
the
most
prominent
high
place
Solomon
offered
1000
burnt
sacrifices
on
that
altar
5
In
Gibeon
Jehovah
appeared
to
Solomon
in
a
dream
by
night
and
God
said
Ask
what
you
would
like
me
to
give
you
6
At
this
Solomon
said
You
have
shown
great
loyal
love
toward
your
servant
David
my
father
as
he
walked
before
you
in
faithfulness
and
in
righteousness
and
in
uprightness
of
heart
You
have
continued
to
show
him
this
great
loyal
love
down
to
this
day
by
giving
him
a
son
to
sit
on
his
throne
7
And
now
Jehovah
my
God
you
have
made
your
servant
king
in
the
place
of
David
my
father
though
I
am
just
a
youth
and
I
am
inexperienced
8
Your
servant
is
among
your
people
whom
you
have
chosen
a
people
so
vast
that
they
cannot
be
numbered
or
counted
9
So
grant
your
servant
an
obedient
heart
to
judge
your
people
to
discern
between
good
and
bad
for
who
is
able
to
judge
this
numerous
people
of
yours
10
It
was
pleasing
to
Jehovah
that
Solomon
had
requested
this
11
God
then
said
to
him
Because
you
requested
this
and
you
did
not
request
for
yourself
long
life
or
riches
or
the
death
of
your
enemies
but
you
requested
understanding
to
hear
judicial
cases
12
I
will
do
what
you
asked
I
will
give
you
a
wise
and
understanding
heart
so
that
just
as
there
has
never
been
anyone
like
you
before
there
will
never
be
anyone
like
you
again
13
Furthermore
what
you
have
not
requested
I
will
give
you
both
riches
and
glory
so
that
there
will
be
no
other
king
like
you
in
your
lifetime
14
And
if
you
walk
in
my
ways
by
keeping
my
regulations
and
my
commandments
just
as
David
your
father
walked
I
will
also
give
you
a
long
life
15
When
Solomon
awoke
he
realized
that
it
had
been
a
dream
Then
he
went
to
Jerusalem
and
stood
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
and
offered
up
burnt
sacrifices
and
communion
offerings
and
spread
a
feast
for
all
his
servants
16
At
that
time
two
prostitutes
came
in
to
the
king
and
stood
before
him
17
The
first
woman
said
Please
my
lord
this
woman
and
I
live
in
one
house
and
I
gave
birth
while
she
was
in
the
house
18
On
the
third
day
after
I
gave
birth
this
woman
also
gave
birth
We
were
together
just
the
two
of
us
there
was
no
one
else
with
us
in
the
house
19
During
the
night
this
womans
son
died
because
she
lay
on
him
20
So
she
got
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
took
my
son
from
my
side
while
your
slave
girl
was
asleep
and
laid
him
in
her
arms
and
she
laid
her
dead
son
in
my
arms
21
When
I
got
up
in
the
morning
to
nurse
my
son
I
saw
that
he
was
dead
So
I
examined
him
closely
in
the
morning
and
saw
that
it
was
not
my
son
whom
I
had
given
birth
to
22
But
the
other
woman
said
No
my
son
is
the
living
one
and
your
son
is
the
dead
one
But
the
first
woman
was
saying
No
your
son
is
the
dead
one
and
my
son
is
the
living
one
That
is
how
they
argued
before
the
king
23
Finally
the
king
said
This
one
says
This
is
my
son
the
living
one
and
your
son
is
the
dead
one
and
that
one
says
No
your
son
is
the
dead
one
and
my
son
is
the
living
one
24
The
king
said
Bring
me
a
sword
So
they
brought
a
sword
to
the
king
25
The
king
then
said
Cut
the
living
child
in
two
and
give
half
to
one
woman
and
half
to
the
other
26
At
once
the
woman
whose
son
was
the
living
one
pleaded
with
the
king
for
her
compassions
were
stirred
toward
her
son
She
said
Please
my
lord
You
should
give
her
the
living
child
By
no
means
put
him
to
death
But
the
other
woman
was
saying
He
will
be
neither
mine
nor
yours
Let
them
cut
him
in
two
27
At
that
the
king
answered
Give
the
living
child
to
the
first
woman
By
no
means
put
him
to
death
for
she
is
his
mother
28
So
all
Israel
heard
about
the
judgment
that
the
king
had
handed
down
and
they
were
in
awe
of
the
king
for
they
saw
that
the
wisdom
of
God
was
with
him
to
execute
justice
1
King

7
Solomon
had
12
deputies
in
charge
of
all
Israel
who
provided
the
king
and
his
household
with
food
Each
one
was
responsible
for
providing

which
is

large

14
Ahinadab
the

king

and
of
Og
king
of
Bashan
There
was
also
one
deputy
in
charge
of
all
these
other
deputies
in
the
land
20
Judah
and
Israel
were
as
numerous
as
the
grains
of
sand
by
the
sea
they
were
eating
and
drinking
and
rejoicing
21
Solomon
ruled
over
all
the
kingdoms
from
the
River
to
the
land
of
the
Philistines
and
to
the
boundary
of
Egypt
They
brought
tribute
and
served
Solomon
all
the
days
of
his
life
22
Solomons
food
for
each
day
was
30
cor
measures
of
fine
flour
and
60
cor
measures
of
flour
23
10
fattened
cattle
20
pastured
cattle
and
100
sheep
besides
some
stags
gazelles
roebucks
and
fattened
cuckoos
24
For
he
controlled
everything
this
side
of
the
River
from
Tiphsah
to
Gaza
including
all
the
kings
on
this
side
of
the
River
and
he
enjoyed
peace
in
every
region
all
around
him
25
Judah
and
Israel
lived
in
security
everyone
under
his
own
vine
and
under
his
own
fig
tree
from
Dan
to
Beer-sheba
all
the
days
of
Solomon
26
And
Solomon
had
4000
stalls
of
horses
for
his
chariots
and
12000
horses
27
These
deputies
supplied
food
to
King
Solomon
and
to
everyone
who
ate
at
the
table
of
King
Solomon
Each
was
responsible
for
his
month
and
saw
to
it
that
nothing
was
lacking
28
They
also
brought
barley
and
straw
wherever
it
was
needed
for
the
horses
and
for
the
teams
of
horses
each
according
to
his
quota
29
And
God
gave
Solomon
wisdom
and
discernment
in
very
great
measure
and
a
broadness
of
heart
like
the
sand
on
the
seashore
30
Solomons
wisdom
surpassed
the
wisdom
of
all
the
people
of
the
East
and
all
the
wisdom
of
Egypt
31
He
was
wiser
than
any
other
man
wiser
than
Ethan
the
Ezrahite
and
Heman
Calcol
and
Darda
the
sons
of
Mahol
his
fame
spread
among
all
the
surrounding
nations
32
He
composed
3000
proverbs
and
his
songs
numbered
1005
33
He
would
speak
about
the
trees
from
the
cedar
in
Lebanon
to
the
hyssop
that
grows
on
the
wall
he
would
speak
about
the
animals
the
birds
the
creeping
things
and
the
fish
34
People
from
all
the
nations
came
to
hear
Solomons
wisdom
including
kings
from
all
over
the
earth
who
had
heard
about
his
wisdom
1
When
Hiram
the
king
of
Tyre
heard
that
Solomon
had
been
anointed
as
king
in
place
of
his
father
he
sent
his
servants
to
Solomon
for
Hiram
had
always
been
a
friend
of
Davids
2
In
turn
Solomon
sent
word
to
Hiram
3
You
well
know
that
David
my
father
was
not
able
to
build
a
house
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
his
God
because
of
the
wars
waged
against
him
from
every
side
until
Jehovah
put
his
enemies
under
the
soles
of
his
feet
4
But
now
Jehovah
my
God
has
given
me
rest
on
all
sides
There
is
no
one
opposing
me
and
nothing
bad
happening
5
So
I
intend
to
build
a
house
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
my
God
just
as
Jehovah
promised
to
David
my
father
saying
Your
son
whom
I
will
put
on
your
throne
in
your
place
he
is
the
one
who
will
build
the
house
for
my
name
6
Now
command
your
people
to
cut
cedars
of
Lebanon
for
me
My
servants
will
work
with
your
servants
and
I
will
pay
the
wages
of
your
servants
according
to
the
rate
you
set
for
you
are
aware
that
not
one
of
us
knows
how
to
cut
trees
like
the
Sidonians
7
When
Hiram
heard
Solomons
words
he
rejoiced
greatly
and
said
May
Jehovah
be
praised
today
for
he
has
given
David
a
wise
son
over
this
great
people
8
So
Hiram
sent
word
to
Solomon
I
have
heard
the
message
you
sent
to
me
I
will
do
all
you
desire
in
providing
the
cedar
and
juniper
timbers
9
My
servants
will
bring
them
down
from
Lebanon
to
the
sea
and
I
will
make
them
into
log
rafts
to
go
by
sea
to
the
place
that
you
designate
to
me
I
will
have
them
broken
up
there
and
you
can
carry
them
away
In
exchange
you
will
provide
the
food
that
I
request
for
my
household
10
So
Hiram
supplied
all
the
timbers
of
cedar
and
juniper
that
Solomon
desired
11
And
Solomon
gave
Hiram
20000
cor
measures
of
wheat
as
food
supplies
for
his
household
and
20
cor
measures
of
very
fine
olive
oil
That
was
what
Solomon
gave
Hiram
year
after
year
12
And
Jehovah
gave
Solomon
wisdom
just
as
He
had
promised
him
And
there
was
peace
between
Hiram
and
Solomon
and
the
two
of
them
made
a
treaty
13
King
Solomon
conscripted
men
for
forced
labor
out
of
all
Israel
30000
men
were
conscripted
14
He
would
send
them
to
Lebanon
in
shifts
of
10000
each
month
They
would
spend
a
month
in
Lebanon
and
two
months
at
their
homes
and
Adoniram
was
over
those
conscripted
for
forced
labor
15
Solomon
had
70000
common
laborers
and
80000
stonecutters
in
the
mountains
16
as
well
as
Solomons
3300
princely
deputies
who
served
as
foremen
to
supervise
the
workmen
17
At
the
kings
order
they
quarried
large
stones
expensive
stones
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
house
with
hewn
stones
18
So
Solomons
builders
and
Hirams
builders
and
the
Gebalites
did
the
cutting
and
they
prepared
the
timbers
and
the
stones
to
build
the
house
1
In
the
480th
year
after
the
Israelites
came
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
in
the
fourth
year
after
Solomon
became
king
over
Israel
in
the
month
of
Ziv
that
is
the
second
month
he
began
to
build
the
house
of
Jehovah
2
The
house
that
King
Solomon
built
for
Jehovah
was
60
cubits
long
20
cubits
wide
and
30
cubits
high
3
The
porch
in
front
of
the
temple
was
20
cubits
long
corresponding
to
the
width
of
the
house
Its
depth
was
ten
cubits
from
the
front
of
the
house
4
He
made
windows
of
narrowing
frames
for
the
house
5
Further
he
built
a
side
structure
against
the
wall
of
the
house
it
went
around
the
walls
of
the
house
those
of
the
temple
and
the
innermost
room
and
he
made
side
chambers
all
around
6
The
lowest
level
of
the
side
chambers
was
five
cubits
wide
the
middle
level
was
six
cubits
wide
and
the
third
level
was
seven
cubits
wide
for
he
made
offsets
all
around
the
house
so
that
nothing
was
attached
to
the
walls
of
the
house
7
The
house
was
built
with
quarry
stone
that
had
already
been
prepared
so
that
no
hammers
or
axes
or
any
iron
tools
were
heard
in
the
house
while
it
was
being
built
8
The
entrance
of
the
lowest
side
chamber
was
on
the
south
side
of
the
house
and
a
winding
staircase
led
up
to
the
middle
floor
and
from
the
middle
floor
up
to
the
third
floor
9
He
continued
building
the
house
and
finished
it
and
covered
the
house
with
cedar
beams
and
rows
of
cedar
planks
10
He
built
the
side
chambers
all
around
the
house
each
five
cubits
high
and
they
were
joined
to
the
house
by
cedar
timbers
11
Meanwhile
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Solomon
saying
12
As
for
this
house
that
you
are
building
if
you
walk
in
my
statutes
and
carry
out
my
judgments
and
observe
all
my
commandments
by
walking
in
them
I
will
also
carry
out
with
you
my
promise
that
I
made
to
David
your
father
13
and
I
will
reside
in
the
midst
of
the
Israelites
and
I
will
not
forsake
my
people
Israel
14
Solomon
continued
building
the
house
to
finish
it
15
He
built
the
inside
walls
of
the
house
with
cedar
boards
He
paneled
the
inside
walls
with
timber
from
the
floor
of
the
house
up
to
the
rafters
of
the
ceiling
and
he
overlaid
the
floor
of
the
house
with
juniper
boards
16
And
he
built
a
section
of
20
cubits
at
the
rear
of
the
house
with
cedar
boards
from
the
floor
up
to
the
rafters
and
he
built
inside
of
it
the
innermost
room
the
Most
Holy
17
And
the
temple—the
part
of
the
house
in
front
of
it—was
40
cubits
18
The
cedar
inside
the
house
was
carved
with
gourds
and
flowers
in
bloom
All
of
it
was
cedar
no
stone
was
seen
19
And
he
prepared
the
innermost
room
inside
the
house
to
put
there
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
20
The
innermost
room
was
20
cubits
long
20
cubits
wide
and
20
cubits
high
and
he
overlaid
it
with
pure
gold
he
overlaid
the
altar
with
cedar
21
Solomon
overlaid
the
interior
of
the
house
with
pure
gold
and
he
stretched
gold
chains
in
front
of
the
innermost
room
which
was
overlaid
with
gold
22
He
overlaid
the
whole
house
with
gold
until
all
the
house
was
completed
he
also
overlaid
with
gold
the
entire
altar
near
the
innermost
room
23
In
the
innermost
room
he
made
two
cherubs
of
pinewood
each
ten
cubits
high
24
One
wing
of
the
cherub
measured
five
cubits
and
the
other
wing
was
five
cubits
From
the
tip
of
one
wing
to
the
tip
of
the
other
wing
was
ten
cubits
25
The
second
cherub
was
also
ten
cubits
The
two
cherubs
had
the
same
size
and
shape
26
The
height
of
the
one
cherub
was
ten
cubits
as
was
that
of
the
other
cherub
27
Then
he
put
the
cherubs
inside
the
inner
house
The
wings
of
the
cherubs
were
extended
so
that
the
wing
of
the
one
cherub
reached
to
one
wall
and
the
wing
of
the
other
cherub
reached
to
the
other
wall
and
their
wings
extended
toward
the
middle
of
the
house
so
that
the
wings
touched
28
And
he
overlaid
the
cherubs
with
gold
29
And
on
all
the
walls
of
the
house
all
around
both
the
inner
and
outer
rooms
he
carved
figures
of
cherubs
palm
trees
and
flowers
in
bloom
30
He
overlaid
the
floor
of
the
house
with
gold
in
the
inner
and
outer
rooms
31
And
for
the
entrance
of
the
innermost
room
he
made
doors
of
pinewood
side
pillars
and
doorposts
as
a
fifth
part
32
The
two
doors
were
of
pinewood
and
he
carved
on
them
cherubs
palm
trees
and
flowers
in
bloom
and
he
overlaid
them
with
gold
and
he
hammered
the
gold
down
over
the
cherubs
and
the
palm
trees
33
For
the
entrance
of
the
temple
that
was
how
he
made
the
doorposts
of
pinewood
belonging
to
a
fourth
part
34
And
he
made
two
doors
of
juniper
wood
The
one
door
had
two
leaves
that
turned
on
pivots
and
the
other
door
had
two
leaves
that
turned
on
pivots
35
He
carved
cherubs
palm
trees
and
flowers
in
bloom
and
overlaid
gold
foil
on
the
carvings
36
He
built
the
inner
courtyard
with
three
rows
of
hewn
stone
and
a
row
of
cedar
beams
37
In
the
4th
year
in
the
month
of
Ziv
the
house
of
Jehovah
had
its
foundation
laid
38
and
in
the
11th
year
in
the
month
of
Bul
that
is
the
eighth
month
the
house
was
finished
in
all
its
details
and
according
to
its
plan
So
he
spent
seven
years
building
it
1
And
it
took
Solomon
13
years
to
build
his
own
house
until
his
whole
house
was
completed
2
And
he
built
the
House
of
the
Forest
of
Lebanon
100
cubits
long
50
cubits
wide
and
30
cubits
high
on
four
rows
of
cedar
pillars
and
there
were
cedar
beams
on
the
pillars
3
It
was
paneled
above
with
cedar
on
the
girders
that
rested
on
the
pillars
they
numbered
45
with
15
to
a
row
4
There
were
three
rows
of
framed
windows
and
each
window
was
opposite
another
window
in
three
tiers
5
All
the
entrances
and
the
doorposts
had
square
frames
as
did
the
front
of
the
windows
that
were
opposite
each
other
in
three
tiers
6
And
he
built
the
Hall
of
Pillars
50
cubits
long
and
30
cubits
wide
and
there
was
a
porch
in
front
of
it
with
pillars
and
a
canopy
7
He
also
built
the
Hall
of
the
Throne
where
he
would
judge—the
Hall
of
Judgment—and
they
paneled
it
with
cedar
from
the
floor
to
the
rafters
8
The
house
where
he
was
to
live
at
the
other
courtyard
was
set
back
from
the
Hall
and
it
was
similar
in
workmanship
He
also
built
a
house
similar
to
this
Hall
for
Pharaohs
daughter
whom
Solomon
had
taken
as
a
wife
9
All
of
these
were
made
of
expensive
stones
hewn
according
to
measure
trimmed
with
stonesaws
inside
and
out
from
the
foundation
up
to
the
coping
and
outside
as
far
as
the
great
courtyard
10
And
the
foundation
was
laid
with
very
large
expensive
stones
some
stones
measured
ten
cubits
and
other
stones
eight
cubits
11
And
above
these
were
expensive
stones
hewn
according
to
measure
as
well
as
cedar
12
Around
the
great
courtyard
were
three
rows
of
hewn
stone
and
a
row
of
cedar
beams
like
that
for
the
inner
courtyard
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
porch
of
the
house
13
King
Solomon
sent
for
Hiram
and
brought
him
from
Tyre
14
He
was
the
son
of
a
widow
from
the
tribe
of
Naphtali
and
his
father
was
a
Tyrian
coppersmith
and
he
had
great
skill
understanding
and
experience
for
all
kinds
of
work
in
copper
So
he
came
to
King
Solomon
and
did
all
his
work
15
He
cast
the
two
pillars
of
copper
each
pillar
was
18
cubits
high
and
it
took
a
measuring
cord
12
cubits
long
to
encircle
each
of
the
two
pillars
16
And
he
made
two
capitals
cast
in
copper
to
put
on
the
tops
of
the
pillars
One
capital
was
five
cubits
high
and
the
other
capital
was
five
cubits
high
17
The
capital
on
top
of
each
pillar
had
mesh
network
with
wreathed
chains
seven
for
the
one
capital
and
seven
for
the
other
capital
18
And
he
made
pomegranates
in
two
rows
around
the
one
network
to
cover
the
capitals
that
were
on
the
top
of
the
pillars
he
did
the
same
for
both
capitals
19
The
capitals
on
top
of
the
pillars
at
the
porch
were
of
a
lily
pattern
four
cubits
high
20
The
capitals
were
on
the
two
pillars
just
above
the
rounded
portion
adjoining
the
network
and
there
were
200
pomegranates
in
rows
all
around
on
each
capital
21
He
set
up
the
pillars
of
the
porch
of
the
temple
He
set
up
the
right-hand
pillar
and
named
it
Jachin
and
then
he
set
up
the
left-hand
pillar
and
named
it
Boaz
22
And
the
top
of
the
pillars
were
of
a
lily
pattern
So
the
work
of
the
pillars
was
completed
23
Then
he
made
the
Sea
of
cast
metal
It
was
circular
in
shape
10
cubits
from
brim
to
brim
and
5
cubits
high
and
it
took
a
measuring
line
30
cubits
long
to
encircle
it
24
And
there
were
ornamental
gourds
below
its
brim
completely
encircling
it
ten
to
a
cubit
all
around
the
Sea
with
two
rows
of
the
gourds
cast
in
one
piece
with
it
25
It
stood
on
12
bulls
3
facing
north
3
facing
west
3
facing
south
and
3
facing
east
and
the
Sea
rested
on
them
and
all
their
hindquarters
were
toward
the
center
26
And
its
thickness
was
a
handbreadth
and
its
brim
was
made
like
the
brim
of
a
cup
like
a
lily
blossom
It
would
hold
2000
bath
measures
27
Then
he
made
the
ten
carriages
of
copper
Each
carriage
was
four
cubits
long
four
cubits
wide
and
three
cubits
high
28
And
this
was
how
the
carriages
were
constructed
They
had
side
panels
and
the
side
panels
were
between
the
crossbars
29
And
on
the
side
panels
between
the
crossbars
were
lions
bulls
and
cherubs
and
the
same
design
was
on
the
crossbars
Above
and
beneath
the
lions
and
the
bulls
were
wreaths
in
relief
30
And
each
carriage
had
four
copper
wheels
and
copper
axles
and
its
four
cornerpieces
served
as
supports
for
them
Beneath
the
basin
were
the
supports
cast
with
wreaths
at
the
side
of
each
31
Its
opening
was
inside
the
crown
extending
upward
one
cubit
and
its
opening
was
round
making
up
a
stand
of
one
and
a
half
cubits
and
on
its
mouth
were
engravings
And
their
side
panels
were
square
not
round
32
The
four
wheels
were
below
the
side
panels
and
the
supports
of
the
wheels
were
attached
to
the
carriage
and
the
height
of
each
wheel
was
one
and
a
half
cubits
33
And
the
wheels
were
made
like
chariot
wheels
Their
supports
rims
spokes
and
hubs
were
all
of
cast
metal
34
There
were
four
supports
on
the
four
corners
of
each
carriage
its
supports
were
cast
as
part
of
the
carriage
35
On
top
of
the
carriage
was
a
circular
band
half
a
cubit
high
and
on
the
top
of
the
carriage
its
framing
pieces
and
its
side
panels
were
cast
as
part
of
it
36
On
the
surfaces
of
its
framing
pieces
and
on
its
side
panels
he
engraved
cherubs
lions
and
palm
trees
according
to
the
amount
of
space
on
each
with
wreaths
all
around
37
This
is
how
he
made
the
ten
carriages
they
were
all
cast
alike
with
the
same
measure
and
shape
38
He
made
ten
copper
basins
each
could
hold
40
bath
measures
Each
basin
measured
four
cubits
There
was
one
basin
for
each
of
the
ten
carriages
39
Then
he
put
five
carriages
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
and
five
on
the
left
side
of
the
house
and
he
placed
the
Sea
on
the
right
side
of
the
house
toward
the
southeast
40
Hiram
also
made
the
basins
the
shovels
and
the
bowls
So
Hiram
finished
all
the
work
that
he
did
for
King
Solomon
on
the
house
of
Jehovah
41
the
two
pillars
and
the
bowl-shaped
capitals
that
were
on
top
of
the
two
pillars
the
two
networks
to
cover
the
two
bowl-shaped
capitals
that
were
on
top
of
the
pillars
42
the
400
pomegranates
for
the
two
networks
two
rows
of
pomegranates
for
each
network
to
cover
the
two
bowl-shaped
capitals
that
were
on
the
two
pillars
43
the
ten
carriages
and
the
ten
basins
on
the
carriages
44
the
Sea
and
the
12
bulls
beneath
the
Sea
45
and
the
cans
the
shovels
the
bowls
and
all
the
utensils
which
Hiram
made
of
polished
copper
for
King
Solomon
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
46
The
king
cast
them
in
clay
molds
in
the
district
of
the
Jordan
between
Succoth
and
Zarethan
47
Solomon
left
all
the
utensils
unweighed
because
they
were
in
such
great
quantities
The
weight
of
the
copper
was
not
ascertained
48
Solomon
made
all
the
utensils
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
altar
of
gold
the
gold
table
on
which
to
put
the
showbread
49
the
lampstands
of
pure
gold
five
on
the
right
and
five
on
the
left
before
the
innermost
room
and
the
blossoms
the
lamps
and
the
snuffers
of
gold
50
the
basins
the
extinguishers
the
bowls
the
cups
and
the
fire
holders
of
pure
gold
and
the
sockets
for
the
doors
of
the
inner
house
that
is
the
Most
Holy
and
for
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
temple
of
gold
51
So
King
Solomon
completed
all
the
work
he
had
to
do
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
Solomon
then
brought
in
the
things
that
David
his
father
had
made
holy
and
he
put
the
silver
the
gold
and
the
articles
into
the
treasuries
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
1
At
that
time
Solomon
congregated
the
elders
of
Israel
all
the
heads
of
the
tribes
the
chieftains
of
the
paternal
houses
of
Israel
They
came
to
King
Solomon
at
Jerusalem
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
from
the
City
of
David
that
is
Zion
2
All
the
men
of
Israel
assembled
before
King
Solomon
at
the
festival
in
the
month
of
Ethanim
that
is
the
seventh
month
3
So
all
the
elders
of
Israel
came
and
the
priests
lifted
up
the
Ark
4
They
brought
up
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
the
tent
of
meeting
and
all
the
holy
utensils
that
were
in
the
tent
The
priests
and
the
Levites
brought
them
up
5
King
Solomon
and
the
entire
assembly
of
Israel
who
had
been
summoned
to
meet
with
him
were
before
the
Ark
So
many
sheep
and
cattle
were
being
sacrificed
that
they
could
not
be
counted
or
numbered
6
Then
the
priests
brought
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
to
its
place
into
the
innermost
room
of
the
house
the
Most
Holy
underneath
the
wings
of
the
cherubs
7
Thus
the
wings
of
the
cherubs
were
spread
out
over
the
place
of
the
Ark
so
that
the
cherubs
overshadowed
the
Ark
and
its
poles
8
The
poles
were
so
long
that
the
tips
of
the
poles
were
visible
from
the
Holy
in
front
of
the
innermost
room
but
they
were
not
visible
from
outside
And
they
are
there
to
this
day
9
There
was
nothing
in
the
Ark
but
the
two
stone
tablets
that
Moses
placed
there
at
Horeb
when
Jehovah
made
a
covenant
with
the
people
of
Israel
while
they
were
coming
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
10
When
the
priests
came
out
from
the
holy
place
the
cloud
filled
the
house
of
Jehovah
11
The
priests
were
not
able
to
stand
to
minister
because
of
the
cloud
for
the
glory
of
Jehovah
filled
the
house
of
Jehovah
12
At
that
time
Solomon
said
Jehovah
said
he
would
reside
in
the
thick
gloom
13
I
have
successfully
built
a
lofty
house
for
you
an
established
place
for
you
to
dwell
in
forever
14
Then
the
king
turned
around
and
began
to
bless
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
while
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
stood
15
He
said
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
be
praised
the
one
who
by
his
own
mouth
promised
my
father
David
and
by
his
own
hand
has
given
fulfillment
saying
16
From
the
day
I
brought
my
people
Israel
out
of
Egypt
I
have
not
chosen
a
city
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
in
which
to
build
a
house
for
my
name
to
remain
there
but
I
have
chosen
David
to
be
over
my
people
Israel
17
And
it
was
the
hearts
desire
of
my
father
David
to
build
a
house
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
18
But
Jehovah
said
to
my
father
David
It
was
your
hearts
desire
to
build
a
house
for
my
name
and
you
did
well
to
desire
this
in
your
heart
19
However
you
will
not
build
the
house
but
your
own
son
who
is
to
be
born
to
you
is
the
one
who
will
build
the
house
for
my
name
20
Jehovah
has
carried
out
the
promise
that
he
made
for
I
have
succeeded
my
father
David
and
I
sit
on
the
throne
of
Israel
just
as
Jehovah
promised
I
have
also
built
the
house
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
21
and
have
set
up
a
place
there
for
the
Ark
containing
the
covenant
that
Jehovah
made
with
our
forefathers
when
he
was
bringing
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
22
Then
Solomon
stood
before
the
altar
of
Jehovah
in
front
of
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
and
he
spread
his
hands
out
to
the
heavens
23
and
he
said
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
there
is
no
God
like
you
in
the
heavens
above
or
on
the
earth
beneath
keeping
the
covenant
and
showing
loyal
love
to
your
servants
who
are
walking
before
you
with
all
their
heart
24
You
have
kept
the
promise
that
you
made
to
your
servant
David
my
father
You
made
the
promise
with
your
own
mouth
and
this
day
you
have
fulfilled
it
with
your
own
hand
25
And
now
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
keep
the
promise
you
made
to
your
servant
David
my
father
when
you
said
There
will
never
fail
to
be
a
man
of
your
line
before
me
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
Israel
if
only
your
sons
will
pay
attention
to
their
way
by
walking
before
me
just
as
you
have
walked
before
me
26
And
now
O
God
of
Israel
let
the
promise
that
you
made
to
your
servant
David
my
father
prove
trustworthy
please
27
But
will
God
really
dwell
on
the
earth
Look
The
heavens
yes
the
heaven
of
the
heavens
cannot
contain
you
how
much
less
then
this
house
that
I
have
built
28
Now
pay
attention
to
the
prayer
of
your
servant
and
to
his
request
for
favor
O
Jehovah
my
God
and
listen
to
the
cry
for
help
and
to
the
prayer
that
your
servant
is
praying
before
you
today
29
May
your
eyes
be
open
toward
this
house
night
and
day
toward
the
place
of
which
you
said
My
name
will
be
there

to
listen
to
the
prayer
that
your
servant
prays
toward
this
place
30
And
listen
to
your
servants
request
for
favor
and
to
the
request
by
your
people
Israel
that
they
pray
toward
this
place
and
may
you
hear
from
your
dwelling
place
in
the
heavens
yes
may
you
hear
and
forgive
31
When
a
man
sins
against
his
fellow
man
and
is
made
to
take
an
oath
and
is
brought
under
liability
to
the
oath
and
while
under
the
oath
he
comes
before
your
altar
in
this
house
32
may
you
then
hear
from
the
heavens
and
act
and
judge
your
servants
by
pronouncing
the
wicked
one
guilty
and
bringing
what
he
did
on
his
own
head
and
by
pronouncing
the
righteous
one
innocent
and
rewarding
him
according
to
his
own
righteousness
33
When
your
people
Israel
are
defeated
by
an
enemy
because
they
kept
sinning
against
you
and
they
return
to
you
and
glorify
your
name
and
pray
and
beg
you
for
favor
in
this
house
34
may
you
then
hear
from
the
heavens
and
forgive
the
sin
of
your
people
Israel
and
bring
them
back
to
the
land
that
you
gave
to
their
forefathers
35
When
the
heavens
are
shut
up
and
there
is
no
rain
because
they
kept
sinning
against
you
and
they
pray
toward
this
place
and
glorify
your
name
and
turn
back
from
their
sin
because
you
humbled
them
36
may
you
then
hear
from
the
heavens
and
forgive
the
sin
of
your
servants
of
your
people
Israel
for
you
will
instruct
them
about
the
good
way
in
which
they
should
walk
and
bring
rain
on
your
land
that
you
gave
to
your
people
as
an
inheritance
37
If
a
famine
occurs
in
the
land
or
a
pestilence
a
scorching
blight
mildew
swarming
locusts
or
voracious
locusts
or
if
their
enemy
besieges
them
in
any
of
the
cities
of
the
land
or
if
any
other
sort
of
plague
or
disease
occurs
38
whatever
prayer
whatever
request
for
favor
may
be
made
by
any
man
or
by
all
your
people
Israel
for
each
one
knows
the
plague
of
his
own
heart
when
they
spread
out
their
hands
toward
this
house
39
then
may
you
hear
from
the
heavens
your
dwelling
place
and
may
you
forgive
and
take
action
and
reward
each
one
according
to
all
his
ways
for
you
know
his
heart
you
alone
truly
know
every
human
heart
40
so
that
they
may
fear
you
all
the
days
they
live
on
the
land
that
you
gave
to
our
forefathers
41
Also
concerning
the
foreigner
who
is
not
part
of
your
people
Israel
and
who
comes
from
a
distant
land
because
of
your
name
42
for
they
will
hear
about
your
great
name
and
your
mighty
hand
and
your
outstretched
arm
and
he
comes
and
prays
toward
this
house
43
may
you
then
listen
from
the
heavens
your
dwelling
place
and
do
all
that
the
foreigner
asks
of
you
so
that
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
may
know
your
name
and
fear
you
as
your
people
Israel
do
and
may
know
that
your
name
has
been
called
on
this
house
that
I
have
built
44
If
your
people
go
to
war
against
their
enemy
in
the
way
that
you
send
them
and
they
pray
to
Jehovah
in
the
direction
of
the
city
that
you
have
chosen
and
toward
the
house
that
I
have
built
for
your
name
45
then
hear
from
the
heavens
their
prayer
and
their
request
for
favor
and
execute
judgment
for
them
46
If
they
sin
against
you
for
there
is
no
man
who
does
not
sin
and
you
are
furious
with
them
and
you
abandon
them
to
an
enemy
and
their
captors
carry
them
off
captive
to
the
land
of
the
enemy
far
or
near
47
and
they
come
to
their
senses
in
the
land
where
they
were
carried
off
captive
and
they
return
to
you
and
beg
you
for
favor
in
the
land
of
their
captors
saying
We
have
sinned
and
done
wrong
we
have
acted
wickedly

48
and
they
return
to
you
with
all
their
heart
and
all
their
soul
in
the
land
of
their
enemies
who
carried
them
off
captive
and
they
pray
to
you
in
the
direction
of
their
land
that
you
gave
to
their
forefathers
and
of
the
city
that
you
have
chosen
and
the
house
that
I
have
built
for
your
name
49
then
hear
from
the
heavens
your
dwelling
place
their
prayer
and
their
request
for
favor
and
execute
judgment
for
them
50
and
forgive
your
people
who
have
sinned
against
you
forgiving
all
their
transgressions
they
committed
against
you
You
will
make
them
objects
of
pity
before
their
captors
and
they
will
pity
them
51
for
they
are
your
people
and
your
inheritance
whom
you
brought
out
of
Egypt
from
inside
the
iron-smelting
furnace
52
May
your
eyes
be
opened
to
your
servants
request
for
favor
and
to
the
request
for
favor
by
your
people
Israel
by
listening
whenever
they
call
to
you
53
For
you
set
them
apart
as
your
inheritance
out
of
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
just
as
you
declared
through
Moses
your
servant
when
you
were
bringing
our
forefathers
out
of
Egypt
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
54
And
as
soon
as
Solomon
finished
offering
to
Jehovah
this
entire
prayer
and
request
for
favor
he
rose
up
from
before
the
altar
of
Jehovah
where
he
had
been
kneeling
with
his
hands
spread
out
to
the
heavens
55
He
then
stood
and
blessed
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
with
a
loud
voice
saying
56
Praised
be
Jehovah
who
has
given
a
resting-place
to
his
people
Israel
just
as
he
promised
Not
one
word
of
all
his
good
promise
that
he
made
through
Moses
his
servant
has
failed
57
May
Jehovah
our
God
be
with
us
just
as
he
was
with
our
forefathers
May
he
not
abandon
us
nor
forsake
us
58
May
he
draw
our
heart
toward
himself
to
walk
in
all
his
ways
and
to
keep
his
commandments
his
regulations
and
his
judgments
which
he
commanded
our
forefathers
to
observe
59
And
may
these
words
of
mine
with
which
I
have
begged
Jehovah
for
favor
be
near
to
Jehovah
our
God
by
day
and
night
that
he
may
execute
judgment
for
his
servant
and
for
his
people
Israel
as
each
day
requires
60
so
that
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
may
know
that
Jehovah
is
the
true
God
There
is
no
other
61
So
let
your
heart
be
complete
with
Jehovah
our
God
by
walking
in
his
regulations
and
by
keeping
his
commandments
as
on
this
day
62
Now
the
king
and
all
Israel
with
him
offered
a
grand
sacrifice
before
Jehovah
63
Solomon
offered
the
communion
sacrifices
to
Jehovah
He
offered
22000
cattle
and
120000
sheep
Thus
the
king
and
all
the
Israelites
inaugurated
the
house
of
Jehovah
64
On
that
day
the
king
had
to
sanctify
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
that
is
before
the
house
of
Jehovah
for
there
he
had
to
offer
up
the
burnt
sacrifices
the
grain
offerings
and
the
fat
pieces
of
the
communion
sacrifices
because
the
copper
altar
that
is
before
Jehovah
was
too
small
to
contain
the
burnt
sacrifices
the
grain
offerings
and
the
fat
pieces
of
the
communion
sacrifices
65
At
that
time
Solomon
held
the
festival
together
with
all
Israel
a
great
congregation
from
Lebo-hamath
down
to
the
Wadi
of
Egypt
before
Jehovah
our
God
for
7
days
and
then
another
7
days
14
days
in
all
66
On
the
following
day
he
sent
the
people
away
and
they
blessed
the
king
and
went
to
their
homes
rejoicing
and
feeling
glad
of
heart
over
all
the
goodness
that
Jehovah
had
shown
to
David
his
servant
and
Israel
his
people
1
As
soon
as
Solomon
had
finished
building
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
house
of
the
king
and
everything
Solomon
desired
to
make
2
Jehovah
appeared
to
Solomon
a
second
time
just
as
he
had
appeared
to
him
in
Gibeon
3
Jehovah
said
to
him
I
have
heard
your
prayer
and
your
request
for
favor
that
you
made
before
me
I
have
sanctified
this
house
that
you
built
by
permanently
putting
my
name
there
and
my
eyes
and
my
heart
will
always
be
there
4
And
you
if
you
walk
before
me
as
your
father
David
walked
with
integrity
of
heart
and
with
uprightness
by
doing
everything
I
have
commanded
you
and
you
obey
my
regulations
and
my
judgments
5
then
I
will
establish
the
throne
of
your
kingdom
over
Israel
forever
just
as
I
promised
your
father
David
saying
There
will
never
fail
to
be
a
man
of
your
line
sitting
on
the
throne
of
Israel
6
But
if
you
and
your
sons
turn
away
from
following
me
and
do
not
keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
that
I
have
put
before
you
and
you
go
and
serve
other
gods
and
bow
down
to
them
7
I
will
cut
Israel
off
from
the
surface
of
the
land
that
I
have
given
to
them
and
the
house
that
I
have
sanctified
for
my
name
I
will
cast
out
of
my
sight
and
Israel
will
become
an
object
of
scorn
and
a
cause
for
ridicule
among
all
the
peoples
8
And
this
house
will
become
heaps
of
ruins
Everyone
passing
by
it
will
stare
in
amazement
and
will
whistle
and
say
Why
did
Jehovah
do
that
to
this
land
and
this
house
9
Then
they
will
say
It
was
because
they
abandoned
Jehovah
their
God
who
had
brought
their
forefathers
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
and
they
embraced
other
gods
and
bowed
down
to
them
and
served
them
That
is
why
Jehovah
brought
all
this
calamity
on
them
10
At
the
end
of
20
years
during
which
Solomon
built
the
two
houses
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
house
of
the
king
11
Hiram
the
king
of
Tyre
had
supplied
Solomon
with
cedar
and
juniper
timbers
and
with
as
much
gold
as
he
desired
and
King
Solomon
gave
to
Hiram
20
cities
in
the
land
of
Galilee
12
So
Hiram
went
out
from
Tyre
to
see
the
cities
that
Solomon
had
given
him
but
he
was
not
satisfied
with
them
13
He
said
What
sort
of
cities
are
these
that
you
have
given
me
my
brother
So
they
came
to
be
called
the
Land
of
Cabul
down
to
this
day
14
In
the
meantime
Hiram
sent
to
the
king
120
talents
of
gold
15
This
is
the
account
of
those
whom
King
Solomon
conscripted
for
forced
labor
to
build
the
house
of
Jehovah
his
own
house
the
Mound
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
Hazor
Megiddo
and
Gezer
16
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
had
come
up
and
captured
Gezer
and
had
burned
it
with
fire
and
he
had
also
killed
the
Canaanites
dwelling
in
the
city
So
he
gave
it
as
a
parting
gift
to
his
daughter
the
wife
of
Solomon
17
Solomon
built
up
Gezer
Lower
Beth-horon
18
Baalath
and
Tamar
in
the
wilderness
within
the
land
19
as
well
as
all
of
Solomons
storage
cities
the
chariot
cities
the
cities
for
the
horsemen
and
whatever
Solomon
desired
to
build
in
Jerusalem
in
Lebanon
and
in
all
the
land
of
his
dominion
20
As
for
all
the
people
who
were
left
from
the
Amorites
the
Hittites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
who
were
not
part
of
the
people
of
Israel
21
their
descendants
who
were
left
in
the
land—those
whom
the
Israelites
had
been
unable
to
devote
to
destruction—were
conscripted
by
Solomon
for
forced
labor
as
slaves
until
this
day
22
But
Solomon
did
not
make
any
of
the
Israelites
slaves
for
they
were
his
warriors
servants
princes
adjutants
and
the
chiefs
of
his
charioteers
and
horsemen
23
There
were
550
chiefs
of
the
deputies
who
were
over
the
work
of
Solomon
the
foremen
over
the
people
who
were
doing
the
work
24
But
Pharaohs
daughter
came
up
from
the
City
of
David
to
her
own
house
that
he
had
built
for
her
then
he
built
the
Mound
25
Three
times
a
year
Solomon
offered
up
burnt
sacrifices
and
communion
sacrifices
on
the
altar
that
he
had
built
for
Jehovah
also
making
sacrificial
smoke
on
the
altar
which
was
before
Jehovah
so
he
completed
the
house
26
King
Solomon
also
made
a
fleet
of
ships
in
Ezion-geber
which
is
by
Eloth
on
the
shore
of
the
Red
Sea
in
the
land
of
Edom
27
Hiram
sent
his
own
servants
with
the
fleet
of
ships
experienced
seamen
to
serve
along
with
the
servants
of
Solomon
28
They
went
to
Ophir
and
took
from
there
420
talents
of
gold
and
brought
it
to
King
Solomon
1
Now
the
queen
of
Sheba
heard
the
report
about
Solomon
in
connection
with
the
name
of
Jehovah
so
she
came
to
test
him
with
perplexing
questions
2
She
arrived
in
Jerusalem
with
a
very
impressive
entourage
with
camels
carrying
balsam
oil
and
great
quantities
of
gold
and
precious
stones
She
went
in
to
Solomon
and
spoke
to
him
about
everything
that
was
close
to
her
heart
3
Solomon
then
answered
all
her
questions
There
was
nothing
too
difficult
for
the
king
to
explain
to
her
4
When
the
queen
of
Sheba
had
seen
all
the
wisdom
of
Solomon
the
house
that
he
built
5
the
food
of
his
table
the
seating
of
his
servants
the
table
service
of
his
waiters
and
their
attire
his
cupbearers
and
his
burnt
sacrifices
that
he
regularly
offered
up
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
she
was
left
completely
breathless
6
So
she
said
to
the
king
The
report
that
I
heard
in
my
own
land
about
your
achievements
and
about
your
wisdom
was
true
7
But
I
did
not
put
faith
in
the
reports
until
I
had
come
and
had
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
And
look
I
had
not
been
told
the
half
You
have
far
surpassed
in
wisdom
and
prosperity
the
report
that
I
heard
8
Happy
are
your
men
and
happy
are
your
servants
who
stand
before
you
constantly
listening
to
your
wisdom
9
May
Jehovah
your
God
be
praised
who
has
taken
pleasure
in
you
by
putting
you
on
the
throne
of
Israel
Because
of
Jehovahs
everlasting
love
for
Israel
he
appointed
you
as
king
to
administer
justice
and
righteousness
10
Then
she
gave
the
king
120
talents
of
gold
and
a
great
amount
of
balsam
oil
and
precious
stones
Never
again
was
such
a
quantity
of
balsam
oil
brought
in
as
what
the
queen
of
Sheba
gave
to
King
Solomon
11
Hirams
fleet
of
ships
that
carried
gold
from
Ophir
also
brought
from
Ophir
algum
timbers
in
very
great
quantity
and
precious
stones
12
The
king
made
from
the
algum
timbers
supports
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
for
the
kings
house
as
well
as
harps
and
stringed
instruments
for
the
singers
Such
algum
timbers
have
never
again
been
brought
in
or
seen
down
to
this
day
13
King
Solomon
also
gave
the
queen
of
Sheba
whatever
she
desired
and
asked
for
in
addition
to
what
he
gave
her
out
of
his
own
generosity
After
that
she
left
and
returned
to
her
own
land
together
with
her
servants
14
And
the
weight
of
the
gold
that
came
to
Solomon
in
one
year
amounted
to
666
talents
of
gold
15
besides
that
from
the
merchants
and
the
profit
from
the
traders
and
from
all
the
kings
of
the
Arabs
and
the
governors
of
the
land
16
King
Solomon
made
200
large
shields
of
alloyed
gold
600
shekels
of
gold
went
on
each
shield
17
and
300
bucklers
of
alloyed
gold
three
minas
of
gold
went
on
each
buckler
Then
the
king
put
them
in
the
House
of
the
Forest
of
Lebanon
18
The
king
also
made
a
great
ivory
throne
and
overlaid
it
with
refined
gold
19
There
were
six
steps
to
the
throne
and
the
throne
had
a
round
canopy
behind
it
and
there
were
armrests
on
both
sides
of
the
seat
and
two
lions
were
standing
beside
the
armrests
20
And
there
were
12
lions
standing
on
the
six
steps
one
at
each
end
of
the
six
steps
No
other
kingdom
had
made
anything
like
it
21
All
the
drinking
vessels
of
King
Solomon
were
of
gold
and
all
the
utensils
of
the
House
of
the
Forest
of
Lebanon
were
of
pure
gold
There
was
nothing
made
of
silver
for
silver
was
considered
as
nothing
in
the
days
of
Solomon
22
For
the
king
had
a
fleet
of
ships
of
Tarshish
on
the
sea
along
with
Hirams
fleet
Once
every
three
years
the
fleet
of
ships
of
Tarshish
would
come
loaded
with
gold
and
silver
ivory
apes
and
peacocks
23
So
King
Solomon
was
greater
than
all
the
other
kings
of
the
earth
in
riches
and
wisdom
24
And
people
of
all
the
earth
sought
an
audience
with
Solomon
to
hear
his
wisdom
that
God
had
put
in
his
heart
25
They
would
each
bring
a
gift—articles
of
silver
articles
of
gold
garments
armor
balsam
oil
horses
and
mules—and
this
continued
year
after
year
26
And
Solomon
kept
accumulating
chariots
and
horses
he
had
1400
chariots
and
12000
horses
and
he
kept
them
stationed
in
the
chariot
cities
and
close
by
the
king
in
Jerusalem
27
The
king
made
the
silver
in
Jerusalem
as
plentiful
as
the
stones
and
cedarwood
as
plentiful
as
the
sycamore
trees
in
the
Shephelah
28
The
horses
of
Solomon
had
been
imported
from
Egypt
and
the
company
of
the
kings
merchants
would
obtain
the
horses
in
droves
for
one
price
29
Each
chariot
imported
from
Egypt
cost
600
silver
pieces
and
a
horse
cost
150
in
turn
they
would
export
them
to
all
the
kings
of
the
Hittites
and
the
kings
of
Syria
1
But
King
Solomon
loved
many
foreign
women
besides
the
daughter
of
Pharaoh
Moabite
Ammonite
Edomite
Sidonian
and
Hittite
women
2
They
were
from
the
nations
about
whom
Jehovah
had
said
to
the
Israelites
You
must
not
go
in
among
them
and
they
should
not
come
in
among
you
for
they
will
surely
incline
your
heart
to
follow
their
gods
But
Solomon
clung
to
them
and
loved
them
3
And
he
had
700
wives
who
were
princesses
and
300
concubines
and
his
wives
gradually
inclined
his
heart
4
In
Solomons
old
age
his
wives
inclined
his
heart
to
follow
other
gods
and
his
heart
was
not
complete
with
Jehovah
his
God
like
the
heart
of
David
his
father
5
And
Solomon
followed
after
Ashtoreth
the
goddess
of
the
Sidonians
and
Milcom
the
disgusting
god
of
the
Ammonites
6
And
Solomon
did
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
he
did
not
follow
Jehovah
completely
as
David
his
father
had
done
7
It
was
then
that
Solomon
built
a
high
place
to
Chemosh
the
disgusting
god
of
Moab
on
the
mountain
in
front
of
Jerusalem
and
to
Molech
the
disgusting
god
of
the
Ammonites
8
That
was
what
he
did
for
all
his
foreign
wives
who
were
making
sacrificial
smoke
and
sacrificing
to
their
gods
9
Jehovah
became
furious
at
Solomon
because
his
heart
had
inclined
away
from
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
who
had
appeared
to
him
twice
10
and
had
warned
him
about
this
very
thing
that
he
should
not
go
after
other
gods
But
he
did
not
obey
what
Jehovah
had
commanded
11
Jehovah
now
said
to
Solomon
Because
you
have
done
this
and
you
have
not
kept
my
covenant
and
my
statutes
as
I
commanded
you
I
will
surely
rip
the
kingdom
away
from
you
and
I
will
give
it
to
one
of
your
servants
12
However
for
the
sake
of
your
father
David
I
will
not
do
it
in
your
lifetime
I
will
rip
it
out
of
the
hand
of
your
son
13
but
I
will
not
rip
away
the
entire
kingdom
One
tribe
I
will
give
to
your
son
for
the
sake
of
David
my
servant
and
for
the
sake
of
Jerusalem
which
I
have
chosen
14
Jehovah
then
raised
up
a
resister
against
Solomon
Hadad
the
Edomite
of
the
royal
family
of
Edom
15
When
David
defeated
Edom
Joab
the
chief
of
the
army
went
up
to
bury
the
slain
and
he
tried
to
strike
down
every
male
in
Edom
16
For
Joab
and
all
Israel
stayed
there
for
six
months
until
he
had
done
away
with
every
male
in
Edom
17
But
Hadad
fled
with
some
of
his
fathers
Edomite
servants
and
they
went
to
Egypt
Hadad
was
then
a
young
boy
18
So
they
set
out
from
Midian
and
came
to
Paran
They
took
men
with
them
from
Paran
and
came
to
Egypt
to
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
who
gave
him
a
house
assigned
him
a
food
allowance
and
gave
him
land
19
Hadad
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
Pharaoh
so
much
so
that
he
gave
him
in
marriage
the
sister
of
his
own
wife
Tahpenes
the
queen
20
In
time
the
sister
of
Tahpenes
bore
him
a
son
Genubath
and
Tahpenes
brought
him
up
in
the
house
of
Pharaoh
and
Genubath
remained
in
the
house
of
Pharaoh
among
the
sons
of
Pharaoh
21
Hadad
heard
in
Egypt
that
David
had
been
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
that
Joab
the
chief
of
the
army
had
died
So
Hadad
said
to
Pharaoh
Send
me
away
so
that
I
may
go
to
my
own
land
22
But
Pharaoh
said
to
him
What
have
you
lacked
with
me
that
you
now
seek
to
go
to
your
own
land
To
this
he
said
Nothing
but
please
send
me
away
23
God
also
raised
up
against
Solomon
another
resister
Rezon
the
son
of
Eliada
who
had
fled
from
his
lord
Hadadezer
the
king
of
Zobah
24
He
gathered
men
to
himself
and
became
chief
of
a
marauder
band
when
David
defeated
them
So
they
went
to
Damascus
and
settled
there
and
began
reigning
in
Damascus
25
And
he
became
a
resister
of
Israel
all
the
days
of
Solomon
adding
to
the
harm
done
by
Hadad
and
he
abhorred
Israel
while
he
reigned
over
Syria
26
And
there
was
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
an
Ephraimite
from
Zeredah
a
servant
of
Solomons
whose
mothers
name
was
Zeruah
a
widow
He
too
began
to
rebel
against
the
king
27
This
is
why
he
rebelled
against
the
king
Solomon
had
built
the
Mound
and
had
closed
up
the
gap
of
the
City
of
David
his
father
28
Now
this
Jeroboam
was
a
capable
man
When
Solomon
saw
that
the
young
man
was
a
hard
worker
he
made
him
overseer
over
all
the
compulsory
service
of
the
house
of
Joseph
29
During
that
time
Jeroboam
went
out
from
Jerusalem
and
the
prophet
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
found
him
on
the
road
Ahijah
was
wearing
a
new
garment
and
the
two
of
them
were
by
themselves
in
the
field
30
Ahijah
took
hold
of
the
new
garment
he
was
wearing
and
ripped
it
into
12
pieces
31
Then
he
said
to
Jeroboam
Take
ten
pieces
for
yourself
for
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
am
ripping
the
kingdom
out
of
the
hand
of
Solomon
and
I
will
give
you
ten
tribes
32
But
one
tribe
will
remain
his
for
the
sake
of
my
servant
David
and
for
the
sake
of
Jerusalem
the
city
I
have
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
33
I
will
do
this
because
they
have
left
me
and
are
bowing
down
to
Ashtoreth
the
goddess
of
the
Sidonians
to
Chemosh
the
god
of
Moab
and
to
Milcom
the
god
of
the
Ammonites
and
they
have
not
walked
in
my
ways
by
doing
what
is
right
in
my
eyes
and
observing
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
as
his
father
David
did
34
But
I
will
not
take
the
entire
kingdom
out
of
his
hand
and
I
will
keep
him
as
a
chieftain
for
all
the
days
of
his
life
for
the
sake
of
David
my
servant
whom
I
chose
because
he
obeyed
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
35
But
I
will
take
the
kingship
out
of
the
hand
of
his
son
and
give
it
to
you
that
is
ten
tribes
36
To
his
son
I
will
give
one
tribe
so
that
David
my
servant
may
always
have
a
lamp
before
me
in
Jerusalem
the
city
that
I
have
chosen
for
myself
as
the
place
to
put
my
name
37
I
will
take
you
and
you
will
reign
over
all
that
you
desire
and
you
will
become
king
over
Israel
38
And
if
you
obey
all
that
I
command
you
and
walk
in
my
ways
and
do
what
is
right
in
my
eyes
by
obeying
my
statutes
and
my
commandments
just
as
David
my
servant
did
I
will
also
be
with
you
I
will
build
you
a
lasting
house
just
as
I
have
built
for
David
and
I
will
give
you
Israel
39
And
I
will
humiliate
the
offspring
of
David
because
of
this
but
not
always
40
So
Solomon
tried
to
put
Jeroboam
to
death
but
Jeroboam
fled
to
Egypt
to
Shishak
the
king
of
Egypt
and
he
remained
in
Egypt
until
Solomons
death
41
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Solomon
all
that
he
did
and
his
wisdom
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
Solomon
42
The
length
of
Solomons
reign
in
Jerusalem
over
all
Israel
was
40
years
43
Then
Solomon
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
in
the
City
of
David
his
father
and
his
son
Rehoboam
became
king
in
his
place
1
Rehoboam
went
to
Shechem
for
all
Israel
had
come
to
Shechem
to
make
him
king
2
As
soon
as
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
heard
of
it
he
was
still
in
Egypt
because
he
had
run
off
on
account
of
King
Solomon
and
was
living
in
Egypt
3
they
sent
for
him
After
that
Jeroboam
and
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
came
to
Rehoboam
and
said
4
Your
father
made
our
yoke
harsh
But
if
you
make
the
harsh
service
of
your
father
easier
and
you
lighten
the
heavy
yoke
he
put
on
us
we
will
serve
you
5
At
this
he
said
to
them
Go
away
for
three
days
then
return
to
me
So
the
people
went
away
6
King
Rehoboam
then
consulted
with
the
older
men
who
had
served
his
father
Solomon
while
he
was
alive
saying
What
advice
would
you
give
on
how
to
reply
to
this
people
7
They
answered
him
If
today
you
would
become
a
servant
to
this
people
and
submit
to
their
request
and
give
them
a
favorable
answer
they
will
always
be
your
servants
8
However
he
rejected
the
advice
that
the
older
men
gave
him
and
he
consulted
with
the
young
men
who
had
grown
up
with
him
and
who
were
now
his
attendants
9
He
asked
them
What
advice
do
you
offer
on
how
we
should
reply
to
this
people
who
have
said
to
me
Make
the
yoke
your
father
put
on
us
lighter
10
The
young
men
who
had
grown
up
with
him
said
to
him
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
this
people
who
have
said
to
you
Your
father
made
our
yoke
heavy
but
you
should
make
it
lighter
for
us
this
is
what
you
should
tell
them
My
little
finger
will
be
thicker
than
my
fathers
hips
11
My
father
imposed
a
heavy
yoke
on
you
but
I
will
add
to
your
yoke
My
father
punished
you
with
whips
but
I
will
punish
you
with
scourges
12
Jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
Rehoboam
on
the
third
day
just
as
the
king
had
said
Return
to
me
on
the
third
day
13
But
the
king
answered
the
people
harshly
rejecting
the
advice
that
the
older
men
had
given
him
14
He
spoke
to
them
according
to
the
advice
of
the
young
men
saying
My
father
made
your
yoke
heavy
but
I
will
add
to
your
yoke
My
father
punished
you
with
whips
but
I
will
punish
you
with
scourges
15
So
the
king
did
not
listen
to
the
people
for
this
turn
of
events
was
caused
by
Jehovah
in
order
to
carry
out
the
word
that
Jehovah
had
spoken
through
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
to
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
16
When
all
Israel
saw
that
the
king
refused
to
listen
to
them
the
people
replied
to
the
king
What
share
do
we
have
in
David
We
have
no
inheritance
in
the
son
of
Jesse
To
your
gods
O
Israel
Now
look
after
your
own
house
O
David
With
that
Israel
returned
to
their
homes
17
But
Rehoboam
continued
to
reign
over
the
Israelites
living
in
the
cities
of
Judah
18
Then
King
Rehoboam
sent
Adoram
who
was
in
charge
of
those
conscripted
for
forced
labor
but
all
Israel
stoned
him
to
death
King
Rehoboam
managed
to
mount
his
chariot
to
flee
to
Jerusalem
19
And
the
Israelites
have
been
in
revolt
against
the
house
of
David
down
to
this
day
20
As
soon
as
all
Israel
heard
that
Jeroboam
had
returned
they
summoned
him
to
the
assembly
and
made
him
king
over
all
Israel
None
of
the
people
followed
the
house
of
David
except
the
tribe
of
Judah
21
When
Rehoboam
arrived
in
Jerusalem
he
immediately
congregated
all
the
house
of
Judah
and
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
180000
trained
warriors
to
fight
against
the
house
of
Israel
in
order
to
restore
the
kingship
to
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon
22
Then
the
word
of
the
true
God
came
to
Shemaiah
the
man
of
the
true
God
saying
23
Say
to
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon
the
king
of
Judah
and
to
all
the
house
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
and
the
rest
of
the
people
24
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
must
not
go
up
and
fight
against
your
Israelite
brothers
Each
one
of
you
must
return
to
his
house
for
I
have
caused
this
to
happen
So
they
obeyed
the
word
of
Jehovah
and
went
back
home
as
Jehovah
had
told
them
25
Jeroboam
then
built
up
Shechem
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
and
lived
there
From
there
he
went
out
and
built
up
Penuel
26
Jeroboam
said
in
his
heart
Now
the
kingdom
will
return
to
the
house
of
David
27
If
this
people
continues
to
go
up
to
offer
sacrifices
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
Jerusalem
the
heart
of
this
people
will
also
return
to
their
lord
King
Rehoboam
of
Judah
Yes
they
will
kill
me
and
return
to
King
Rehoboam
of
Judah
28
After
consultation
the
king
made
two
golden
calves
and
said
to
the
people
It
is
too
much
for
you
to
go
up
to
Jerusalem
Here
is
your
God
O
Israel
who
brought
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
29
Then
he
placed
one
in
Bethel
and
the
other
he
put
in
Dan
30
And
this
caused
them
to
sin
and
the
people
went
as
far
as
Dan
to
worship
the
one
there
31
And
he
made
houses
of
worship
on
the
high
places
and
appointed
priests
from
the
people
in
general
those
who
were
not
Levites
32
Jeroboam
also
established
a
festival
in
the
eighth
month
on
the
15th
day
of
the
month
like
the
festival
in
Judah
On
the
altar
that
he
made
at
Bethel
he
sacrificed
to
the
calves
he
had
made
and
at
Bethel
he
assigned
priests
for
the
high
places
that
he
had
made
33
And
he
began
to
make
offerings
on
the
altar
that
he
had
made
at
Bethel
on
the
15th
day
in
the
eighth
month
in
the
month
that
he
had
devised
on
his
own
and
he
established
a
festival
for
the
people
of
Israel
and
he
ascended
the
altar
to
make
offerings
and
sacrificial
smoke
1
By
the
word
of
Jehovah
a
man
of
God
came
from
Judah
to
Bethel
while
Jeroboam
was
standing
by
the
altar
to
make
sacrificial
smoke
2
Then
he
called
out
against
the
altar
by
the
word
of
Jehovah
and
said
O
altar
altar
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Look
A
son
named
Josiah
will
be
born
to
the
house
of
David
He
will
sacrifice
on
you
the
priests
of
the
high
places
those
making
sacrificial
smoke
on
you
and
he
will
burn
human
bones
on
you
3
He
gave
a
sign
on
that
day
saying
This
is
the
sign
that
Jehovah
has
declared
Look
The
altar
will
be
ripped
apart
and
the
ashes
that
are
on
it
will
be
spilled
out
4
As
soon
as
the
king
heard
the
word
that
the
man
of
the
true
God
had
called
out
against
the
altar
at
Bethel
Jeroboam
stretched
out
his
hand
from
the
altar
and
said
Seize
him
Immediately
the
hand
that
he
had
stretched
out
against
him
dried
up
and
he
could
not
draw
it
back
5
Then
the
altar
was
ripped
apart
and
the
ashes
were
spilled
out
from
the
altar
according
to
the
sign
that
the
man
of
the
true
God
had
given
by
the
word
of
Jehovah
6
The
king
now
said
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
Please
beg
for
the
favor
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
pray
in
my
behalf
that
my
hand
may
be
restored
to
me
At
this
the
man
of
the
true
God
begged
for
the
favor
of
Jehovah
and
the
kings
hand
was
restored
to
its
former
condition
7
The
king
then
said
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
Come
home
with
me
and
take
some
food
and
let
me
give
you
a
gift
8
But
the
man
of
the
true
God
said
to
the
king
Even
if
you
gave
me
half
your
house
I
would
not
come
with
you
and
eat
bread
or
drink
water
in
this
place
9
For
this
is
what
I
was
commanded
by
the
word
of
Jehovah
You
must
not
eat
bread
or
drink
water
and
you
must
not
return
by
the
way
you
came
10
So
he
left
by
another
way
and
he
did
not
return
by
the
way
he
had
come
to
Bethel
11
There
was
a
certain
old
prophet
dwelling
in
Bethel
and
his
sons
came
home
and
related
to
him
all
the
things
that
the
man
of
the
true
God
had
done
that
day
in
Bethel
and
the
words
he
had
spoken
to
the
king
After
they
related
this
to
their
father
12
their
father
asked
them
Which
way
did
he
go
So
his
sons
showed
him
the
way
that
the
man
of
the
true
God
from
Judah
had
gone
13
He
now
said
to
his
sons
Saddle
the
donkey
for
me
They
saddled
the
donkey
for
him
and
he
mounted
it
14
He
followed
the
man
of
the
true
God
and
found
him
sitting
under
a
big
tree
Then
he
said
to
him
Are
you
the
man
of
the
true
God
who
came
from
Judah
He
replied
I
am
15
He
said
to
him
Come
home
with
me
and
eat
bread
16
But
he
said
I
cannot
go
back
with
you
or
accept
your
invitation
nor
may
I
eat
bread
or
drink
water
with
you
in
this
place
17
For
I
was
told
by
the
word
of
Jehovah
You
must
not
eat
bread
or
drink
water
there
You
must
not
return
by
the
way
you
came
18
At
this
he
said
to
him
I
too
am
a
prophet
like
you
and
an
angel
told
me
by
the
word
of
Jehovah
Have
him
come
back
with
you
to
your
house
so
that
he
may
eat
bread
and
drink
water
He
deceived
him
19
So
he
went
back
with
him
to
eat
bread
and
drink
water
in
his
house
20
While
they
were
sitting
at
the
table
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
the
prophet
who
had
brought
him
back
21
and
he
called
out
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
from
Judah
saying
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Because
you
rebelled
against
the
order
of
Jehovah
and
did
not
keep
the
commandment
that
Jehovah
your
God
gave
you
22
but
you
went
back
to
eat
bread
and
drink
water
in
the
place
about
which
you
were
told
Do
not
eat
bread
or
drink
water

your
dead
body
will
not
come
into
the
tomb
of
your
forefathers
23
After
the
man
of
the
true
God
ate
bread
and
drank
the
old
prophet
saddled
the
donkey
for
the
prophet
whom
he
had
brought
back
24
Then
he
got
on
his
way
but
a
lion
came
across
him
on
the
road
and
killed
him
His
dead
body
was
thrown
onto
the
road
and
the
donkey
stood
beside
it
the
lion
was
also
standing
beside
the
dead
body
25
There
were
men
passing
by
who
saw
the
dead
body
thrown
onto
the
road
and
the
lion
standing
beside
the
dead
body
They
came
in
and
told
about
it
in
the
city
where
the
old
prophet
lived
26
When
the
prophet
who
had
brought
him
back
from
the
road
heard
of
it
he
immediately
said
It
is
the
man
of
the
true
God
who
rebelled
against
the
order
of
Jehovah
so
Jehovah
gave
him
over
to
the
lion
to
maul
and
to
kill
him
according
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
that
he
spoke
to
him
27
He
then
said
to
his
sons
Saddle
the
donkey
for
me
So
they
saddled
it
28
Then
he
went
on
his
way
and
found
the
dead
body
thrown
onto
the
road
with
the
donkey
and
the
lion
standing
beside
it
The
lion
had
not
eaten
the
dead
body
nor
had
it
mauled
the
donkey
29
The
prophet
lifted
up
the
dead
body
of
the
man
of
the
true
God
and
put
him
on
the
donkey
and
he
brought
him
back
into
his
own
city
to
mourn
and
bury
him
30
So
he
laid
the
dead
body
in
his
own
tomb
and
they
kept
crying
out
over
him
Too
bad
my
brother
31
After
burying
him
he
told
his
sons
When
I
die
you
must
bury
me
in
the
place
where
the
man
of
the
true
God
is
buried
Lay
my
bones
next
to
his
bones
32
The
word
that
he
called
out
by
the
word
of
Jehovah
against
the
altar
in
Bethel
and
against
all
the
houses
of
worship
on
the
high
places
in
the
cities
of
Samaria
is
sure
to
take
place
33
Even
after
this
happened
Jeroboam
did
not
turn
back
from
his
bad
way
but
he
kept
appointing
priests
for
the
high
places
from
the
people
in
general
He
would
install
as
priests
anyone
who
so
desired
saying
Let
him
become
one
of
the
priests
for
the
high
places
34
This
sin
on
the
part
of
the
household
of
Jeroboam
led
to
their
destruction
and
annihilation
from
the
face
of
the
earth
1
At
that
time
Abijah
the
son
of
Jeroboam
fell
sick
2
So
Jeroboam
said
to
his
wife
Rise
up
please
and
disguise
yourself
so
that
they
will
not
know
that
you
are
Jeroboams
wife
and
go
to
Shiloh
Look
Ahijah
the
prophet
is
there
He
is
the
one
who
spoke
of
me
becoming
king
over
this
people
3
Take
with
you
ten
loaves
of
bread
sprinkled
cakes
and
a
flask
of
honey
and
go
to
him
He
will
then
tell
you
what
is
going
to
happen
to
the
boy
4
Jeroboams
wife
did
what
he
said
She
rose
up
and
went
to
Shiloh
and
came
to
the
house
of
Ahijah
Ahijahs
eyes
stared
straight
ahead
and
he
could
not
see
because
of
his
age
5
But
Jehovah
had
told
Ahijah
Here
is
the
wife
of
Jeroboam
coming
to
inquire
of
you
regarding
her
son
for
he
is
sick
I
will
tell
you
what
to
say
to
her
When
she
arrives
she
will
conceal
her
identity
6
As
soon
as
Ahijah
heard
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
as
she
was
coming
into
the
entrance
he
said
Come
in
wife
of
Jeroboam
Why
are
you
concealing
your
identity
I
have
been
assigned
to
give
you
a
harsh
message
7
Go
tell
Jeroboam
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
I
raised
you
up
from
among
your
people
to
make
you
a
leader
over
my
people
Israel
8
Then
I
ripped
the
kingdom
away
from
the
house
of
David
and
gave
it
to
you
But
you
have
not
become
like
my
servant
David
who
kept
my
commandments
and
who
walked
after
me
with
all
his
heart
doing
only
what
was
right
in
my
eyes
9
But
you
have
done
worse
than
all
those
who
were
prior
to
you
and
you
made
for
yourself
another
god
and
metal
images
to
offend
me
and
it
is
I
whom
you
have
turned
your
back
on
10
For
that
reason
I
am
bringing
calamity
on
the
house
of
Jeroboam
and
I
will
annihilate
from
Jeroboam
every
male
including
the
helpless
and
weak
in
Israel
and
I
will
make
a
clean
sweep
of
the
house
of
Jeroboam
just
as
one
clears
away
the
dung
until
it
is
all
gone
11
Anyone
belonging
to
Jeroboam
who
dies
in
the
city
the
dogs
will
eat
and
anyone
who
dies
in
the
field
the
birds
of
the
heavens
will
eat
for
Jehovah
has
spoken
it
12
Now
rise
up
go
to
your
house
When
you
set
foot
in
the
city
the
child
will
die
13
All
Israel
will
mourn
him
and
bury
him
for
he
alone
of
Jeroboams
family
will
be
laid
in
a
grave
because
he
is
the
only
one
of
the
house
of
Jeroboam
in
whom
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
has
found
something
good
14
Jehovah
will
raise
up
for
himself
a
king
over
Israel
who
will
do
away
with
the
house
of
Jeroboam
from
that
day
forward
yes
even
now
15
Jehovah
will
strike
Israel
down
like
a
reed
that
sways
in
the
water
and
he
will
uproot
Israel
off
this
good
land
that
he
gave
to
their
forefathers
and
he
will
scatter
them
beyond
the
River
because
they
made
their
sacred
poles
offending
Jehovah
16
And
he
will
abandon
Israel
because
of
the
sins
that
Jeroboam
has
committed
and
has
caused
Israel
to
commit
17
At
that
Jeroboams
wife
rose
up
and
went
on
her
way
and
came
to
Tirzah
As
she
came
to
the
threshold
of
the
house
the
boy
died
18
So
they
buried
him
and
all
Israel
mourned
him
according
to
Jehovahs
word
that
he
had
spoken
through
his
servant
Ahijah
the
prophet
19
And
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jeroboam
how
he
waged
war
and
how
he
reigned
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
20
And
the
length
of
Jeroboams
reign
was
22
years
after
which
he
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
his
son
Nadab
became
king
in
his
place
21
Meanwhile
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon
had
become
king
in
Judah
Rehoboam
was
41
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
17
years
in
Jerusalem
the
city
that
Jehovah
had
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
as
the
place
to
put
his
name
The
name
of
Rehoboams
mother
was
Naamah
the
Ammonitess
22
And
Judah
was
doing
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
by
the
sins
they
committed
they
provoked
him
more
than
their
forefathers
had
done
23
They
too
kept
building
for
themselves
high
places
sacred
pillars
and
sacred
poles
on
every
high
hill
and
under
every
luxuriant
tree
24
There
were
also
male
temple
prostitutes
in
the
land
They
acted
according
to
all
the
detestable
things
of
the
nations
that
Jehovah
had
driven
out
before
the
Israelites
25
In
the
fifth
year
of
King
Rehoboam
King
Shishak
of
Egypt
came
up
against
Jerusalem
26
He
took
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
treasures
of
the
kings
house
He
took
everything
including
all
the
gold
shields
that
Solomon
had
made
27
So
King
Rehoboam
made
copper
shields
to
replace
them
and
he
entrusted
them
to
the
chiefs
of
the
guard
who
guarded
the
entrance
of
the
kings
house
28
Whenever
the
king
came
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
guards
would
carry
them
and
then
they
would
return
them
to
the
guard
chamber
29
And
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Rehoboam
all
that
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
30
There
was
constant
warfare
between
Rehoboam
and
Jeroboam
31
Then
Rehoboam
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
His
mothers
name
was
Naamah
the
Ammonitess
And
his
son
Abijam
became
king
in
his
place
1
In
the
18th
year
of
King
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
Abijam
became
king
over
Judah
2
He
reigned
for
three
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Maacah
the
granddaughter
of
Abishalom
3
He
went
on
walking
in
all
the
sins
that
his
father
committed
prior
to
him
and
his
heart
was
not
complete
with
Jehovah
his
God
like
the
heart
of
David
his
forefather
4
However
on
account
of
David
Jehovah
his
God
gave
him
a
lamp
in
Jerusalem
by
raising
up
his
son
after
him
and
keeping
Jerusalem
in
existence
5
For
David
did
what
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
he
did
not
turn
aside
from
anything
that
He
had
commanded
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
except
in
the
matter
of
Uriah
the
Hittite
6
And
there
was
warfare
between
Rehoboam
and
Jeroboam
all
the
days
of
his
life
7
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Abijam
all
that
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
There
was
also
war
between
Abijam
and
Jeroboam
8
Then
Abijam
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
City
of
David
and
his
son
Asa
became
king
in
his
place
9
In
the
20th
year
of
King
Jeroboam
of
Israel
Asa
began
to
reign
over
Judah
10
He
reigned
in
Jerusalem
for
41
years
His
grandmothers
name
was
Maacah
the
granddaughter
of
Abishalom
11
Asa
did
what
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
like
David
his
forefather
12
He
expelled
the
male
temple
prostitutes
from
the
land
and
removed
all
the
disgusting
idols
that
his
forefathers
had
made
13
He
even
removed
Maacah
his
grandmother
from
her
position
as
queen
mother
because
she
had
made
an
obscene
idol
for
the
worship
of
the
sacred
pole
Asa
cut
down
her
obscene
idol
and
burned
it
in
the
Kidron
Valley
14
But
the
high
places
were
not
removed
Nevertheless
Asas
heart
was
complete
with
Jehovah
all
his
life
15
And
he
brought
the
things
that
he
and
his
father
had
made
holy
into
the
house
of
Jehovah—silver
gold
and
various
utensils
16
There
was
constant
warfare
between
Asa
and
Baasha
the
king
of
Israel
17
So
King
Baasha
of
Israel
came
up
against
Judah
and
began
to
build
up
Ramah
to
prevent
anyone
from
going
out
or
coming
in
to
King
Asa
of
Judah
18
At
that
Asa
took
all
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
were
left
in
the
treasuries
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
treasuries
of
the
house
of
the
king
and
handed
them
over
to
his
servants
King
Asa
then
sent
them
to
Ben-hadad
the
son
of
Tabrimmon
the
son
of
Hezion
the
king
of
Syria
who
was
dwelling
in
Damascus
saying
19
There
is
a
treaty
between
me
and
you
and
between
my
father
and
your
father
I
am
sending
you
a
gift
of
silver
and
gold
Come
break
your
treaty
with
King
Baasha
of
Israel
so
that
he
will
withdraw
from
me
20
Ben-hadad
listened
to
King
Asa
and
sent
the
chiefs
of
his
armies
against
the
cities
of
Israel
and
they
struck
down
Ijon
Dan
Abel-beth-maacah
all
Chinnereth
and
all
the
land
of
Naphtali
21
When
Baasha
heard
of
it
he
immediately
quit
building
Ramah
and
continued
dwelling
in
Tirzah
22
King
Asa
then
summoned
all
Judah—no
one
was
exempt—and
they
carried
off
the
stones
and
timbers
of
Ramah
that
Baasha
had
been
building
with
and
with
them
King
Asa
built
up
Geba
in
Benjamin
and
Mizpah
23
As
for
all
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Asa
all
his
mightiness
and
all
that
he
did
and
the
cities
that
he
built
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
But
in
his
old
age
he
suffered
from
a
disease
in
his
feet
24
Then
Asa
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
with
them
in
the
City
of
David
his
forefather
and
his
son
Jehoshaphat
became
king
in
his
place
25
Nadab
the
son
of
Jeroboam
became
king
over
Israel
in
the
second
year
of
King
Asa
of
Judah
and
he
reigned
over
Israel
for
two
years
26
He
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
walked
in
the
way
of
his
father
and
in
his
sin
that
he
caused
Israel
to
commit
27
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah
of
the
house
of
Issachar
conspired
against
him
and
Baasha
struck
him
down
at
Gibbethon
which
belonged
to
the
Philistines
while
Nadab
and
all
Israel
were
besieging
Gibbethon
28
So
Baasha
put
him
to
death
in
the
third
year
of
King
Asa
of
Judah
and
became
king
in
his
place
29
And
as
soon
as
he
became
king
he
struck
down
all
the
house
of
Jeroboam
He
did
not
let
remain
anyone
breathing
who
belonged
to
Jeroboam
he
had
them
annihilated
according
to
Jehovahs
word
that
he
had
spoken
through
his
servant
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
30
This
was
because
of
the
sins
that
Jeroboam
had
committed
and
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
and
because
he
had
greatly
offended
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
31
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Nadab
all
that
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
32
And
there
was
constant
warfare
between
Asa
and
King
Baasha
of
Israel
33
In
the
third
year
of
King
Asa
of
Judah
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah
became
king
in
Tirzah
over
all
Israel
and
reigned
for
24
years
34
But
he
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
he
walked
in
the
way
of
Jeroboam
and
in
his
sin
that
he
caused
Israel
to
commit
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
against
Baasha
then
came
to
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
saying
2
I
raised
you
up
out
of
the
dust
and
made
you
leader
over
my
people
Israel
but
you
kept
walking
in
the
way
of
Jeroboam
and
caused
my
people
Israel
to
sin
so
that
they
offended
me
with
their
sins
3
So
I
am
making
a
clean
sweep
of
Baasha
and
his
house
and
I
will
make
his
house
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
4
Anyone
belonging
to
Baasha
who
dies
in
the
city
the
dogs
will
eat
and
anyone
belonging
to
him
who
dies
in
the
field
the
birds
of
the
heavens
will
eat
5
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Baasha
what
he
did
and
his
mightiness
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
6
Then
Baasha
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
in
Tirzah
and
Elah
his
son
became
king
in
his
place
7
Also
through
the
prophet
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
Jehovahs
word
came
against
Baasha
and
his
house
both
because
of
all
the
badness
that
he
committed
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
by
offending
him
with
the
work
of
his
hands
becoming
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
and
also
because
of
his
striking
him
down
8
In
the
26th
year
of
King
Asa
of
Judah
Elah
the
son
of
Baasha
became
king
over
Israel
in
Tirzah
and
he
reigned
for
two
years
9
His
servant
Zimri
the
chief
of
half
of
his
chariot
forces
conspired
against
him
while
he
was
in
Tirzah
drinking
himself
drunk
at
the
house
of
Arza
who
was
over
the
household
in
Tirzah
10
Zimri
came
in
and
struck
him
down
and
put
him
to
death
in
the
27th
year
of
King
Asa
of
Judah
and
he
became
king
in
his
place
11
When
he
became
king
as
soon
as
he
sat
down
on
his
throne
he
struck
down
all
the
house
of
Baasha
He
did
not
spare
a
single
male
whether
of
his
relatives
or
of
his
friends
12
Thus
Zimri
annihilated
the
whole
house
of
Baasha
according
to
the
word
that
Jehovah
had
spoken
against
Baasha
through
Jehu
the
prophet
13
This
was
for
all
the
sins
that
Baasha
and
his
son
Elah
had
committed
and
the
sins
they
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
by
offending
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
with
their
worthless
idols
14
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Elah
all
that
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
15
In
the
27th
year
of
King
Asa
of
Judah
Zimri
became
king
for
seven
days
in
Tirzah
while
the
troops
were
camped
against
Gibbethon
which
belonged
to
the
Philistines
16
In
time
the
troops
who
were
encamped
heard
it
being
said
Zimri
has
conspired
and
has
also
struck
down
the
king
So
all
Israel
made
Omri
the
chief
of
the
army
king
over
Israel
on
that
day
in
the
camp
17
Omri
and
all
Israel
with
him
went
up
from
Gibbethon
and
laid
siege
to
Tirzah
18
When
Zimri
saw
that
the
city
had
been
captured
he
went
into
the
fortified
tower
of
the
kings
house
and
burned
the
house
down
over
himself
and
he
died
19
This
was
for
his
own
sins
that
he
had
committed
by
doing
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
by
walking
in
the
way
of
Jeroboam
and
for
the
sin
he
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
20
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Zimri
and
his
conspiracy
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
21
It
was
then
that
the
people
of
Israel
were
divided
into
two
factions
One
part
of
the
people
became
followers
of
Tibni
the
son
of
Ginath
wanting
to
make
him
king
and
the
other
part
followed
Omri
22
But
the
people
who
were
following
Omri
prevailed
over
the
people
following
Tibni
the
son
of
Ginath
So
Tibni
died
and
Omri
became
king
23
In
the
31st
year
of
King
Asa
of
Judah
Omri
became
king
over
Israel
and
he
reigned
for
12
years
In
Tirzah
he
reigned
for
six
years
24
He
bought
the
mountain
of
Samaria
from
Shemer
for
two
talents
of
silver
and
he
built
a
city
on
the
mountain
He
named
the
city
that
he
built
Samaria
after
Shemer
the
owner
of
the
mountain
25
Omri
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
he
was
worse
than
all
who
were
prior
to
him
26
He
walked
in
all
the
ways
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
and
in
the
sin
he
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
by
offending
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
with
their
worthless
idols
27
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Omri
what
he
did
and
his
mighty
exploits
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
28
Then
Omri
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
in
Samaria
and
his
son
Ahab
became
king
in
his
place
29
Ahab
the
son
of
Omri
became
king
over
Israel
in
the
38th
year
of
King
Asa
of
Judah
and
Ahab
the
son
of
Omri
reigned
over
Israel
in
Samaria
for
22
years
30
Ahab
the
son
of
Omri
was
worse
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
than
all
those
who
were
prior
to
him
31
As
if
it
were
a
trivial
thing
for
him
to
walk
in
the
sins
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
he
also
took
as
wife
Jezebel
the
daughter
of
Ethbaal
the
king
of
the
Sidonians
and
began
to
serve
Baal
and
to
bow
down
to
him
32
Further
he
set
up
an
altar
to
Baal
at
the
house
of
Baal
that
he
built
in
Samaria
33
Ahab
also
made
the
sacred
pole
Ahab
did
more
to
offend
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
than
all
the
kings
of
Israel
prior
to
him
34
In
his
days
Hiel
the
Bethelite
rebuilt
Jericho
At
the
cost
of
Abiram
his
firstborn
he
laid
its
foundation
and
at
the
cost
of
Segub
his
youngest
he
put
up
its
doors
according
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
spoken
through
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
1
Now
Elijah
the
Tishbite
an
inhabitant
of
Gilead
said
to
Ahab
As
surely
as
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
whom
I
serve
is
living
during
these
years
there
will
be
no
dew
or
rain
except
by
my
word
2
The
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
him
saying
3
Leave
here
and
turn
eastward
and
hide
at
the
Valley
of
Cherith
east
of
the
Jordan
4
You
should
drink
from
the
stream
and
I
will
command
the
ravens
to
supply
you
food
there
5
He
immediately
went
and
did
according
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
he
went
and
stayed
by
the
Valley
of
Cherith
east
of
the
Jordan
6
And
the
ravens
were
bringing
him
bread
and
meat
in
the
morning
and
bread
and
meat
in
the
evening
and
he
drank
from
the
stream
7
But
after
some
days
the
stream
ran
dry
because
there
was
no
rain
in
the
land
8
The
word
of
Jehovah
then
came
to
him
9
Rise
up
go
to
Zarephath
which
belongs
to
Sidon
and
stay
there
Look
I
will
command
a
widow
there
to
supply
you
with
food
10
So
he
rose
up
and
went
to
Zarephath
When
he
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
city
there
was
a
widow
gathering
pieces
of
wood
So
he
called
to
her
and
said
Please
bring
me
a
little
water
in
a
cup
so
that
I
may
drink
11
As
she
went
to
get
it
he
called
to
her
Please
bring
me
a
piece
of
bread
in
your
hand
12
At
this
she
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
your
God
is
living
I
have
no
bread
only
a
handful
of
flour
in
the
large
jar
and
a
little
oil
in
the
small
jar
Now
I
am
gathering
a
few
pieces
of
wood
and
I
will
go
in
and
make
something
for
me
and
my
son
After
we
have
eaten
we
will
die
13
Then
Elijah
said
to
her
Do
not
be
afraid
Go
in
and
do
as
you
said
But
first
make
me
a
small
round
loaf
of
bread
with
what
is
there
and
bring
it
out
to
me
Then
you
can
make
something
afterward
for
you
and
your
son
14
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
The
large
jar
of
flour
will
not
run
out
and
the
small
jar
of
oil
will
not
run
dry
until
the
day
Jehovah
makes
it
rain
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
15
So
she
went
and
did
as
Elijah
said
and
she
together
with
him
and
her
household
ate
for
many
days
16
The
large
jar
of
flour
did
not
run
out
and
the
small
jar
of
oil
did
not
run
dry
according
to
Jehovahs
word
that
he
had
spoken
through
Elijah
17
After
these
things
the
son
of
the
woman
who
owned
the
house
fell
sick
and
his
sickness
became
so
severe
that
he
stopped
breathing
18
At
this
she
said
to
Elijah
What
do
you
have
against
me
O
man
of
the
true
God
Have
you
come
to
remind
me
of
my
guilt
and
to
put
my
son
to
death
19
But
he
said
to
her
Give
me
your
son
Then
he
took
him
from
her
arms
and
carried
him
up
to
the
roof
chamber
where
he
was
staying
and
he
laid
him
on
his
own
bed
20
He
called
out
to
Jehovah
O
Jehovah
my
God
are
you
also
bringing
harm
to
the
widow
with
whom
I
am
staying
by
putting
her
son
to
death
21
Then
he
stretched
himself
out
over
the
child
three
times
and
called
out
to
Jehovah
O
Jehovah
my
God
please
let
this
childs
life
come
back
into
him
22
Jehovah
listened
to
Elijahs
request
and
the
life
of
the
child
came
back
into
him
and
he
revived
23
Elijah
took
the
child
and
brought
him
down
from
the
roof
chamber
into
the
house
and
gave
him
to
his
mother
and
Elijah
said
See
your
son
is
alive
24
At
that
the
woman
said
to
Elijah
Now
I
know
that
you
truly
are
a
man
of
God
and
that
Jehovahs
word
in
your
mouth
is
truth
1
After
some
time
in
the
third
year
Jehovahs
word
came
to
Elijah
saying
Go
present
yourself
to
Ahab
and
I
will
send
rain
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
2
So
Elijah
went
to
present
himself
to
Ahab
while
the
famine
was
severe
in
Samaria
3
Meanwhile
Ahab
called
Obadiah
who
was
over
the
household
Now
Obadiah
greatly
feared
Jehovah
4
and
when
Jezebel
was
doing
away
with
Jehovahs
prophets
Obadiah
took
100
prophets
and
hid
them
50
to
a
cave
and
he
supplied
them
with
bread
and
water
5
Ahab
then
said
to
Obadiah
Go
through
the
land
to
all
the
springs
of
water
and
to
all
the
valleys
Perhaps
we
can
find
enough
grass
to
keep
the
horses
and
mules
alive
and
not
have
all
our
animals
die
6
So
they
divided
between
themselves
the
land
they
were
going
to
pass
through
Ahab
went
alone
by
one
way
and
Obadiah
went
alone
by
another
way
7
As
Obadiah
was
on
his
way
Elijah
was
there
to
meet
him
At
once
he
recognized
him
and
fell
facedown
and
said
Is
this
you
my
lord
Elijah
8
He
replied
to
him
It
is
I
Go
and
tell
your
lord
Elijah
is
here
9
But
he
said
What
sin
have
I
committed
that
you
should
hand
your
servant
over
to
Ahab
to
put
me
to
death
10
As
surely
as
Jehovah
your
God
is
living
there
is
not
a
nation
or
a
kingdom
where
my
lord
has
not
sent
to
look
for
you
After
they
said
He
is
not
here

he
made
the
kingdom
and
the
nation
swear
that
they
could
not
find
you
11
Now
you
are
saying
Go
and
tell
your
lord
Elijah
is
here
12
When
I
depart
from
you
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
will
carry
you
away
to
a
place
I
will
not
know
and
when
I
tell
Ahab
and
he
does
not
find
you
he
will
surely
kill
me
Yet
your
servant
has
feared
Jehovah
from
his
youth
13
Has
my
lord
not
been
told
what
I
did
when
Jezebel
was
killing
the
prophets
of
Jehovah
how
I
hid
100
of
the
prophets
of
Jehovah
by
groups
of
50
in
a
cave
and
kept
supplying
them
bread
and
water
14
But
now
you
are
saying
Go
and
tell
your
lord
Elijah
is
here
He
will
certainly
kill
me
15
However
Elijah
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
of
armies
whom
I
serve
is
living
today
I
will
present
myself
to
him
16
So
Obadiah
went
off
to
meet
Ahab
and
told
him
and
Ahab
went
to
meet
Elijah
17
As
soon
as
Ahab
saw
Elijah
he
said
to
him
Is
this
you
the
one
bringing
great
trouble
on
Israel
18
To
this
he
said
I
have
not
brought
trouble
on
Israel
but
you
and
the
house
of
your
father
have
by
abandoning
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
and
by
following
the
Baals
19
And
now
summon
all
Israel
to
me
at
Mount
Carmel
as
well
as
the
450
prophets
of
Baal
and
the
400
prophets
of
the
sacred
pole
who
are
eating
at
the
table
of
Jezebel
20
So
Ahab
sent
word
among
all
the
people
of
Israel
and
collected
the
prophets
together
at
Mount
Carmel
21
Then
Elijah
approached
all
the
people
and
said
How
long
will
you
be
limping
between
two
different
opinions
If
Jehovah
is
the
true
God
follow
him
but
if
Baal
is
follow
him
But
the
people
did
not
say
a
word
in
answer
to
him
22
Elijah
then
said
to
the
people
I
am
the
only
prophet
of
Jehovah
left
while
the
prophets
of
Baal
are
450
men
23
Let
them
give
us
two
young
bulls
and
let
them
choose
one
young
bull
and
cut
it
into
pieces
and
put
it
on
the
wood
but
they
should
not
put
fire
to
it
I
will
prepare
the
other
young
bull
and
I
will
place
it
on
the
wood
but
I
will
not
put
fire
to
it
24
Then
you
must
call
on
the
name
of
your
god
and
I
will
call
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
The
God
who
answers
by
fire
will
show
that
he
is
the
true
God
To
this
all
the
people
answered
What
you
say
is
good
25
Elijah
now
said
to
the
prophets
of
Baal
Choose
one
young
bull
and
prepare
it
first
because
you
are
the
majority
Then
call
on
the
name
of
your
god
but
you
must
not
put
fire
to
it
26
So
they
took
the
young
bull
that
was
given
to
them
prepared
it
and
kept
calling
on
the
name
of
Baal
from
morning
until
noon
saying
O
Baal
answer
us
But
there
was
no
voice
and
no
one
answering
They
kept
limping
around
the
altar
that
they
had
made
27
About
noon
Elijah
began
to
mock
them
and
say
Call
out
at
the
top
of
your
voice
After
all
he
is
a
god
Perhaps
he
is
deep
in
thought
or
he
has
gone
to
relieve
himself
Or
maybe
he
is
asleep
and
someone
needs
to
wake
him
up
28
They
were
calling
out
at
the
top
of
their
voice
and
cutting
themselves
with
daggers
and
lances
according
to
their
custom
until
their
blood
gushed
out
all
over
them
29
Noon
was
past
and
they
continued
in
a
frenzy
until
the
time
the
evening
grain
offering
is
presented
but
there
was
no
voice
and
no
one
answering
no
one
was
paying
attention
30
At
length
Elijah
said
to
all
the
people
Approach
me
So
all
the
people
approached
him
Then
he
repaired
the
altar
of
Jehovah
that
had
been
torn
down
31
Elijah
then
took
12
stones
corresponding
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
the
sons
of
Jacob
to
whom
Jehovahs
word
had
come
saying
Israel
will
be
your
name
32
With
the
stones
he
built
an
altar
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
Then
he
made
a
trench
all
around
the
altar
an
area
large
enough
to
sow
with
two
seah
measures
of
seed
33
After
that
he
put
the
pieces
of
wood
in
order
cut
the
young
bull
into
pieces
and
placed
it
on
the
wood
He
now
said
Fill
four
large
jars
with
water
and
pour
it
on
the
burnt
offering
and
on
the
pieces
of
wood
34
Then
he
said
Do
it
again
So
they
did
it
again
Once
more
he
said
Do
it
a
third
time
So
they
did
it
a
third
time
35
And
the
water
ran
all
around
the
altar
and
he
also
filled
the
trench
with
water
36
About
the
time
when
the
evening
grain
offering
is
presented
Elijah
the
prophet
stepped
forward
and
said
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Abraham
Isaac
and
Israel
today
let
it
be
known
that
you
are
God
in
Israel
and
that
I
am
your
servant
and
that
it
is
by
your
word
that
I
have
done
all
these
things
37
Answer
me
O
Jehovah
Answer
me
so
that
this
people
may
know
that
you
Jehovah
are
the
true
God
and
that
you
are
turning
their
hearts
back
to
you
38
At
that
the
fire
of
Jehovah
fell
from
above
and
consumed
the
burnt
offering
the
pieces
of
wood
the
stones
and
the
dust
and
it
licked
up
the
water
from
the
trench
39
When
all
the
people
saw
it
they
immediately
fell
facedown
and
said
Jehovah
is
the
true
God
Jehovah
is
the
true
God
40
Then
Elijah
said
to
them
Seize
the
prophets
of
Baal
Do
not
let
a
single
one
of
them
escape
At
once
they
seized
them
and
Elijah
brought
them
down
to
the
stream
of
Kishon
and
slaughtered
them
there
41
Elijah
now
said
to
Ahab
Go
up
eat
and
drink
for
there
is
the
sound
of
a
heavy
downpour
42
So
Ahab
went
up
to
eat
and
drink
while
Elijah
went
up
to
the
top
of
Carmel
and
crouched
on
the
ground
keeping
his
face
between
his
knees
43
Then
he
said
to
his
attendant
Go
up
please
and
look
toward
the
sea
So
he
went
up
and
looked
and
said
There
is
nothing
at
all
Seven
times
Elijah
said
Go
back
44
The
seventh
time
his
attendant
said
Look
There
is
a
small
cloud
like
a
mans
hand
ascending
out
of
the
sea
He
now
said
Go
say
to
Ahab
Hitch
up
the
chariot
Go
down
so
that
the
downpour
may
not
detain
you
45
Meanwhile
the
sky
grew
dark
with
clouds
the
wind
blew
and
a
heavy
downpour
fell
and
Ahab
kept
riding
and
made
his
way
to
Jezreel
46
But
the
hand
of
Jehovah
came
on
Elijah
and
he
wrapped
his
garment
around
his
hips
and
ran
ahead
of
Ahab
all
the
way
to
Jezreel
1
Then
Ahab
told
Jezebel
all
that
Elijah
had
done
and
how
he
had
killed
all
the
prophets
with
the
sword
2
At
that
Jezebel
sent
a
messenger
to
Elijah
saying
So
may
the
gods
do
to
me
and
add
to
it
if
by
this
time
tomorrow
I
do
not
make
you
like
each
one
of
them
3
At
that
he
became
afraid
so
he
got
up
and
ran
for
his
life
He
came
to
Beer-sheba
which
belongs
to
Judah
and
he
left
his
attendant
there
4
He
went
a
days
journey
into
the
wilderness
and
came
and
sat
down
under
a
broom
tree
and
he
asked
that
he
might
die
He
said
It
is
enough
Now
O
Jehovah
take
my
life
away
for
I
am
no
better
than
my
forefathers
5
Then
he
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
under
the
broom
tree
But
suddenly
an
angel
touched
him
and
said
to
him
Get
up
and
eat
6
When
he
looked
there
at
his
head
was
a
round
loaf
on
heated
stones
and
a
jug
of
water
He
ate
and
drank
and
lay
down
again
7
Later
the
angel
of
Jehovah
came
back
a
second
time
and
touched
him
and
said
Get
up
and
eat
for
the
journey
will
be
too
much
for
you
8
So
he
got
up
and
ate
and
drank
and
in
the
strength
of
that
nourishment
he
went
on
for
40
days
and
40
nights
until
he
reached
Horeb
the
mountain
of
the
true
God
9
There
he
entered
a
cave
and
spent
the
night
and
look
Jehovahs
word
came
to
him
telling
him
What
are
you
doing
here
Elijah
10
To
this
he
said
I
have
been
absolutely
zealous
for
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
for
the
people
of
Israel
have
forsaken
your
covenant
your
altars
they
have
torn
down
and
your
prophets
they
have
killed
with
the
sword
and
I
am
the
only
one
left
Now
they
are
seeking
to
take
my
life
away
11
But
He
said
Go
out
and
stand
on
the
mountain
before
Jehovah
And
look
Jehovah
was
passing
by
and
a
great
and
strong
wind
was
splitting
mountains
and
breaking
crags
before
Jehovah
but
Jehovah
was
not
in
the
wind
After
the
wind
there
was
an
earthquake
but
Jehovah
was
not
in
the
earthquake
12
After
the
earthquake
there
was
a
fire
but
Jehovah
was
not
in
the
fire
After
the
fire
there
was
a
calm
low
voice
13
As
soon
as
Elijah
heard
it
he
wrapped
his
face
in
his
official
garment
and
went
out
and
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
Then
a
voice
asked
him
What
are
you
doing
here
Elijah
14
To
this
he
said
I
have
been
absolutely
zealous
for
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
for
the
people
of
Israel
have
forsaken
your
covenant
your
altars
they
have
torn
down
and
your
prophets
they
have
killed
with
the
sword
and
I
am
the
only
one
left
Now
they
are
seeking
to
take
my
life
away
15
Jehovah
said
to
him
Return
and
go
to
the
wilderness
of
Damascus
When
you
arrive
anoint
Hazael
as
king
over
Syria
16
And
you
should
anoint
Jehu
the
grandson
of
Nimshi
as
king
over
Israel
and
you
should
anoint
Elisha
the
son
of
Shaphat
from
Abel-meholah
as
prophet
to
take
your
place
17
Anyone
escaping
from
Hazaels
sword
Jehu
will
put
to
death
and
anyone
escaping
from
Jehus
sword
Elisha
will
put
to
death
18
And
I
still
have
left
7000
in
Israel
all
whose
knees
have
not
bent
down
to
Baal
and
whose
mouths
have
not
kissed
him
19
So
he
went
from
there
and
found
Elisha
the
son
of
Shaphat
while
he
was
plowing
with
12
pairs
of
bulls
ahead
of
him
and
he
was
with
the
12th
pair
So
Elijah
went
over
to
him
and
threw
his
official
garment
on
him
20
At
that
he
left
the
bulls
and
ran
after
Elijah
and
said
Please
let
me
kiss
my
father
and
my
mother
Then
I
will
follow
you
He
replied
to
him
Go
return
for
what
have
I
done
to
stop
you
21
So
he
went
back
and
took
a
pair
of
bulls
and
sacrificed
them
and
he
used
the
plowing
gear
to
boil
the
meat
of
the
bulls
and
gave
it
to
the
people
and
they
ate
After
that
he
rose
up
and
followed
Elijah
and
began
to
minister
to
him
1
Now
King
Ben-hadad
of
Syria
gathered
his
whole
army
together
along
with
32
other
kings
and
their
horses
and
chariots
he
went
up
and
laid
siege
to
Samaria
and
fought
against
it
2
Then
he
sent
messengers
to
King
Ahab
of
Israel
at
the
city
and
said
to
him
This
is
what
Ben-hadad
says
3
Your
silver
and
your
gold
are
mine
as
well
as
the
best
of
your
wives
and
your
sons
4
To
this
the
king
of
Israel
answered
According
to
your
word
my
lord
the
king
I
am
yours
along
with
all
that
belongs
to
me
5
The
messengers
later
came
back
and
said
This
is
what
Ben-hadad
says
I
sent
this
message
to
you
Your
silver
your
gold
your
wives
and
your
sons
you
will
give
me
6
But
about
this
time
tomorrow
I
will
send
my
servants
to
you
and
they
will
carefully
search
your
house
and
the
houses
of
your
servants
and
all
your
desirable
things
they
will
seize
and
take
away
7
At
that
the
king
of
Israel
called
all
the
elders
of
the
land
and
said
Take
note
please
and
see
that
this
man
is
bent
on
bringing
calamity
for
he
demanded
my
wives
my
sons
my
silver
and
my
gold
and
I
did
not
refuse
him
8
Then
all
the
elders
and
all
the
people
said
to
him
Do
not
obey
and
do
not
consent
9
So
he
said
to
the
messengers
of
Ben-hadad
Say
to
my
lord
the
king
All
that
you
first
demanded
of
your
servant
I
will
do
but
this
I
cannot
do
With
that
the
messengers
went
off
and
brought
word
back
to
him
10
Ben-hadad
now
sent
him
this
message
So
may
the
gods
do
to
me
and
add
to
it
if
there
is
enough
dust
in
Samaria
to
give
each
of
the
people
following
me
a
handful
11
The
king
of
Israel
answered
Tell
him
The
one
who
puts
on
his
armor
should
not
boast
about
himself
like
one
who
takes
it
off
12
As
soon
as
he
heard
this
reply
while
he
and
the
kings
were
drinking
in
their
tents
he
said
to
his
servants
Get
ready
to
attack
So
they
got
ready
to
attack
the
city
13
But
a
prophet
approached
King
Ahab
of
Israel
and
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Have
you
seen
all
this
large
crowd
Here
I
am
giving
it
into
your
hand
today
and
then
you
will
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
14
Ahab
asked
By
whom
to
which
he
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
By
the
attendants
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
So
he
asked
Who
will
start
the
battle
to
which
he
said
You
15
Ahab
then
counted
the
attendants
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
and
they
were
232
after
that
he
counted
all
the
Israelite
men
7000
16
They
went
out
at
noon
while
Ben-hadad
was
drinking
himself
drunk
in
the
tents
along
with
the
32
kings
who
were
helping
him
17
When
the
attendants
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
came
out
first
Ben-hadad
at
once
sent
messengers
They
reported
to
him
Men
have
come
out
from
Samaria
18
At
that
he
said
If
they
have
come
out
for
peace
take
them
alive
or
if
they
have
come
out
for
battle
you
should
still
take
them
alive
19
But
when
these
came
out
of
the
city—the
attendants
of
the
princes
of
the
provinces
and
the
armies
that
were
following
them—
20
each
one
struck
down
his
opponent
Then
the
Syrians
fled
and
Israel
pursued
them
but
King
Ben-hadad
of
Syria
escaped
on
a
horse
with
some
of
the
horsemen
21
But
the
king
of
Israel
went
out
and
kept
striking
down
the
horses
and
the
chariots
and
he
inflicted
a
great
defeat
on
the
Syrians
22
Later
the
prophet
approached
the
king
of
Israel
and
said
to
him
Go
strengthen
yourself
and
consider
what
you
are
going
to
do
for
at
the
start
of
the
next
year
the
king
of
Syria
will
come
up
against
you
23
Now
the
servants
of
the
king
of
Syria
said
to
him
Their
God
is
a
God
of
mountains
That
is
why
they
overpowered
us
But
if
we
fight
against
them
on
level
land
we
will
overpower
them
24
Also
do
this
Remove
all
the
kings
from
their
places
and
replace
them
with
governors
25
Then
gather
an
army
equal
to
the
army
you
lost
horse
for
horse
and
chariot
for
chariot
Let
us
fight
against
them
on
level
land
and
we
will
surely
overpower
them
So
he
listened
to
their
advice
and
did
just
that
26
At
the
start
of
the
year
Ben-hadad
mustered
the
Syrians
and
went
up
to
Aphek
for
battle
against
Israel
27
The
people
of
Israel
were
also
mustered
and
supplied
and
they
went
out
to
meet
them
When
the
people
of
Israel
camped
in
front
of
them
they
were
like
two
tiny
flocks
of
goats
while
the
Syrians
filled
the
whole
land
28
Then
the
man
of
the
true
God
approached
the
king
of
Israel
and
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Because
the
Syrians
have
said
Jehovah
is
a
God
of
mountains
and
he
is
not
a
God
of
plains

I
will
give
all
this
large
crowd
into
your
hand
and
you
will
certainly
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
29
They
remained
encamped
opposite
each
other
for
seven
days
and
on
the
seventh
day
the
battle
began
The
people
of
Israel
struck
down
100000
Syrian
foot
soldiers
in
one
day
30
And
the
rest
fled
to
Aphek
into
the
city
But
the
wall
fell
down
on
27000
of
the
men
who
were
left
Ben-hadad
also
fled
and
came
into
the
city
and
he
hid
in
an
inner
room
31
So
his
servants
said
to
him
Look
we
have
heard
that
the
kings
of
the
house
of
Israel
are
merciful
kings
Please
let
us
wear
sackcloth
on
our
hips
and
put
ropes
on
our
heads
and
go
out
to
the
king
of
Israel
Perhaps
he
will
spare
your
life
32
So
they
wore
sackcloth
around
their
hips
and
ropes
on
their
heads
and
came
in
to
the
king
of
Israel
and
said
Your
servant
Ben-hadad
says
Please
let
me
live
He
replied
Is
he
still
alive
He
is
my
brother
33
The
men
took
it
as
an
omen
and
quickly
took
him
at
his
word
so
they
said
Ben-hadad
is
your
brother
At
that
he
said
Go
and
get
him
Then
Ben-hadad
went
out
to
him
and
he
had
him
get
up
into
the
chariot
34
Ben-hadad
now
said
to
him
The
cities
that
my
father
took
from
your
father
I
will
return
and
you
may
establish
markets
for
yourself
in
Damascus
just
as
my
father
did
in
Samaria
Ahab
replied
On
the
basis
of
this
agreement
I
will
let
you
go
With
that
he
made
an
agreement
with
him
and
let
him
go
35
By
the
word
of
Jehovah
one
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
said
to
his
companion
Strike
me
please
But
the
man
refused
to
strike
him
36
So
he
said
to
him
Because
you
did
not
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
as
soon
as
you
leave
me
a
lion
will
kill
you
After
he
left
him
a
lion
came
upon
him
and
killed
him
37
He
found
another
man
and
said
Strike
me
please
So
the
man
struck
him
and
wounded
him
38
Then
the
prophet
went
and
waited
for
the
king
by
the
road
disguising
himself
with
a
bandage
over
his
eyes
39
As
the
king
was
passing
by
he
cried
out
to
the
king
Your
servant
went
into
the
thick
of
the
battle
and
there
was
a
man
coming
out
who
brought
a
man
to
me
and
said
Guard
this
man
If
he
is
found
missing
your
life
will
have
to
take
the
place
of
his
life
or
else
you
will
pay
a
talent
of
silver
40
And
while
your
servant
was
busy
here
and
there
suddenly
the
man
was
gone
The
king
of
Israel
said
to
him
So
your
own
judgment
will
be
you
have
decided
it
yourself
41
Then
he
quickly
removed
the
bandage
from
his
eyes
and
the
king
of
Israel
recognized
that
he
was
one
of
the
prophets
42
He
said
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Because
you
have
let
the
man
whom
I
said
should
be
destroyed
escape
from
your
hand
your
life
must
take
the
place
of
his
life
and
your
people
the
place
of
his
people
43
At
that
the
king
of
Israel
went
home
to
Samaria
sullen
and
dejected
1
After
these
things
an
incident
took
place
concerning
a
vineyard
that
belonged
to
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
it
was
in
Jezreel
next
to
the
palace
of
Ahab
the
king
of
Samaria
2
Ahab
said
to
Naboth
Give
me
your
vineyard
for
me
to
use
as
a
vegetable
garden
for
it
is
near
my
house
Then
I
will
give
you
a
better
vineyard
to
replace
it
Or
if
you
prefer
I
will
give
you
its
value
in
money
3
But
Naboth
said
to
Ahab
It
is
unthinkable
from
Jehovahs
standpoint
for
me
to
give
you
the
inheritance
of
my
forefathers
4
So
Ahab
came
into
his
house
sullen
and
dejected
over
the
answer
that
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
had
given
him
when
he
said
I
will
not
give
you
the
inheritance
of
my
forefathers
Then
he
lay
down
on
his
bed
kept
his
face
turned
away
and
refused
to
eat
5
His
wife
Jezebel
came
in
to
him
and
asked
him
Why
are
you
so
sad
that
you
refuse
to
eat
6
He
replied
to
her
Because
I
said
to
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
Give
me
your
vineyard
for
money
Or
if
you
prefer
let
me
give
you
another
vineyard
to
replace
it
But
he
said
I
will
not
give
you
my
vineyard
7
His
wife
Jezebel
said
to
him
Are
you
not
the
one
ruling
as
king
over
Israel
Get
up
eat
something
and
let
your
heart
be
cheerful
I
will
give
you
the
vineyard
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
8
So
she
wrote
letters
in
Ahabs
name
and
sealed
them
with
his
seal
and
sent
the
letters
to
the
elders
and
the
nobles
who
lived
in
Naboths
city
9
She
wrote
in
the
letters
Proclaim
a
fast
and
have
Naboth
sit
at
the
head
of
the
people
10
And
have
two
good-for-nothing
men
sit
in
front
of
him
and
testify
against
him
saying
You
have
cursed
God
and
the
king
Then
bring
him
out
and
stone
him
to
death
11
So
the
men
of
his
city
the
elders
and
the
nobles
who
lived
in
his
city
did
just
as
was
written
in
the
letters
that
Jezebel
sent
to
them
12
They
proclaimed
a
fast
and
had
Naboth
sit
at
the
head
of
the
people
13
Then
two
of
the
good-for-nothing
men
came
in
and
sat
down
in
front
of
him
and
began
to
testify
against
Naboth
in
front
of
the
people
saying
Naboth
has
cursed
God
and
the
king
After
that
they
brought
him
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
stoned
him
to
death
14
They
now
sent
word
to
Jezebel
saying
Naboth
has
been
stoned
to
death
15
As
soon
as
Jezebel
heard
that
Naboth
had
been
stoned
to
death
she
said
to
Ahab
Get
up
take
possession
of
the
vineyard
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
which
he
refused
to
give
you
for
money
for
Naboth
is
no
longer
alive
He
is
dead
16
As
soon
as
Ahab
heard
that
Naboth
was
dead
Ahab
got
up
to
go
down
to
the
vineyard
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
to
take
possession
of
it
17
But
Jehovahs
word
came
to
Elijah
the
Tishbite
saying
18
Get
up
go
down
to
meet
Ahab
the
king
of
Israel
who
is
in
Samaria
There
he
is
in
the
vineyard
of
Naboth
where
he
has
gone
to
take
possession
of
it
19
You
must
tell
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Have
you
murdered
a
man
and
also
taken
his
property
Then
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
In
the
place
where
the
dogs
licked
up
the
blood
of
Naboth
the
dogs
will
lick
up
your
own
blood
20
Ahab
said
to
Elijah
So
you
have
found
me
O
my
enemy
He
replied
I
have
found
you
Because
you
are
determined
to
do
what
is
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
21
here
I
am
bringing
calamity
upon
you
and
I
will
make
a
clean
sweep
after
you
and
will
annihilate
from
Ahab
every
male
including
the
helpless
and
weak
in
Israel
22
And
I
will
make
your
house
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
and
like
the
house
of
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah
for
you
have
provoked
my
anger
and
have
caused
Israel
to
sin
23
Also
concerning
Jezebel
Jehovah
has
said
The
dogs
will
eat
up
Jezebel
in
the
plot
of
land
of
Jezreel
24
Anyone
belonging
to
Ahab
who
dies
in
the
city
the
dogs
will
eat
up
and
anyone
who
dies
in
the
field
the
birds
of
the
heavens
will
eat
up
25
Indeed
there
has
never
been
anyone
like
Ahab
who
was
so
determined
to
do
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
egged
on
by
his
wife
Jezebel
26
He
acted
in
the
most
detestable
way
by
going
after
the
disgusting
idols
just
as
all
the
Amorites
had
done
whom
Jehovah
drove
out
from
before
the
Israelites
27
As
soon
as
Ahab
heard
these
words
he
ripped
his
garments
apart
and
put
sackcloth
on
his
body
and
he
went
on
a
fast
and
kept
lying
down
in
sackcloth
and
walking
despondently
28
Jehovahs
word
then
came
to
Elijah
the
Tishbite
29
Have
you
seen
how
Ahab
has
humbled
himself
on
my
account
Because
he
has
humbled
himself
before
me
I
will
not
bring
the
calamity
during
his
lifetime
I
will
bring
the
calamity
upon
his
house
in
the
days
of
his
son
1
For
three
years
there
was
no
war
between
Syria
and
Israel
2
In
the
third
year
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Judah
went
down
to
the
king
of
Israel
3
Then
the
king
of
Israel
said
to
his
servants
Do
you
know
that
Ramoth-gilead
belongs
to
us
And
yet
we
are
hesitating
to
take
it
back
from
the
king
of
Syria
4
He
then
said
to
Jehoshaphat
Will
you
go
with
me
to
fight
at
Ramoth-gilead
Jehoshaphat
replied
to
the
king
of
Israel
I
am
the
same
as
you
My
people
are
the
same
as
your
people
My
horses
are
the
same
as
your
horses
5
But
Jehoshaphat
said
to
the
king
of
Israel
First
inquire
please
for
the
word
of
Jehovah
6
So
the
king
of
Israel
gathered
the
prophets
together
about
400
men
and
said
to
them
Should
I
go
to
war
against
Ramoth-gilead
or
should
I
refrain
They
said
Go
up
and
Jehovah
will
give
it
into
the
kings
hand
7
Jehoshaphat
then
said
Is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
Jehovah
Let
us
also
inquire
through
him
8
At
that
the
king
of
Israel
said
to
Jehoshaphat
There
is
still
one
more
man
through
whom
we
can
inquire
of
Jehovah
but
I
hate
him
for
he
never
prophesies
good
things
concerning
me
only
bad
He
is
Micaiah
the
son
of
Imlah
However
Jehoshaphat
said
The
king
should
not
say
such
a
thing
9
So
the
king
of
Israel
called
a
court
official
and
said
Bring
Micaiah
the
son
of
Imlah
quickly
10
Now
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
were
each
sitting
on
his
throne
dressed
in
royal
attire
at
the
threshing
floor
at
the
entrance
of
the
gate
of
Samaria
and
all
the
prophets
were
prophesying
before
them
11
Then
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
made
for
himself
iron
horns
and
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
With
these
you
will
gore
the
Syrians
until
you
exterminate
them
12
All
the
other
prophets
were
prophesying
the
same
way
saying
Go
up
to
Ramoth-gilead
and
you
will
be
successful
Jehovah
will
give
it
into
the
kings
hand
13
So
the
messenger
who
went
to
call
Micaiah
said
to
him
Look
The
words
of
the
prophets
are
unanimously
favorable
to
the
king
Let
your
word
please
become
like
their
words
and
speak
favorably
14
But
Micaiah
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
whatever
Jehovah
says
to
me
is
what
I
will
speak
15
Then
he
came
in
to
the
king
and
the
king
asked
him
Micaiah
should
we
go
to
war
against
Ramoth-gilead
or
should
we
refrain
At
once
he
replied
Go
up
and
you
will
be
successful
Jehovah
will
give
it
into
the
kings
hand
16
At
that
the
king
said
to
him
How
many
times
must
I
put
you
under
oath
not
to
speak
to
me
anything
but
the
truth
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
17
So
he
said
I
see
all
the
Israelites
scattered
on
the
mountains
like
sheep
that
have
no
shepherd
Jehovah
said
These
have
no
master
Let
each
one
go
back
to
his
house
in
peace
18
Then
the
king
of
Israel
said
to
Jehoshaphat
Did
I
not
tell
you
He
will
not
prophesy
good
things
concerning
me
only
bad
19
Micaiah
then
said
Therefore
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
I
saw
Jehovah
sitting
on
his
throne
and
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
standing
by
him
to
his
right
and
to
his
left
20
Jehovah
then
said
Who
will
fool
Ahab
so
that
he
will
go
up
and
fall
at
Ramoth-gilead
And
one
was
saying
one
thing
while
another
said
something
else
21
Then
a
spirit
came
forward
and
stood
before
Jehovah
and
said
I
will
fool
him
Jehovah
asked
him
How
will
you
do
it
22
He
replied
I
will
go
out
and
become
a
deceptive
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
So
he
said
You
will
fool
him
and
what
is
more
you
will
be
successful
Go
out
and
do
that
23
And
now
Jehovah
has
put
a
deceptive
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
these
prophets
of
yours
but
Jehovah
has
declared
calamity
for
you
24
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
now
approached
and
struck
Micaiah
on
the
cheek
and
said
Which
way
did
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
pass
from
me
to
speak
with
you
25
Micaiah
replied
Look
You
will
see
which
way
on
the
day
when
you
will
enter
the
innermost
room
to
hide
26
Then
the
king
of
Israel
said
Take
Micaiah
and
turn
him
over
to
Amon
the
chief
of
the
city
and
to
Joash
the

27
Tell
them
This
is
what
the
king
says
Put
this
fellow
in
the
prison
and
feed
him
with
a
reduced
allowance
of
bread
and
water
until
I
return
in
peace
28
But
Micaiah
said
If
you
do
return
in
peace
Jehovah
has
not
spoken
with
me
Then
he
added
Take
note
all
you
peoples
29
So
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
went
up
to
Ramoth-gilead
30
The
king
of
Israel
now
said
to
Jehoshaphat
I
will
disguise
myself
and
will
go
into
the
battle
but
you
should
put
on
your
royal
attire
So
the
king
of
Israel
disguised
himself
and
entered
the
battle
31
Now
the
king
of
Syria
had
ordered
his
32
chariot
commanders
Do
not
fight
with
anyone
small
or
great
except
the
king
of
Israel
32
And
as
soon
as
the
chariot
commanders
saw
Jehoshaphat
they
said
to
themselves
Surely
it
is
the
king
of
Israel
So
they
turned
to
fight
against
him
and
Jehoshaphat
began
to
cry
for
help
33
When
the
chariot
commanders
saw
that
it
was
not
the
king
of
Israel
they
immediately
turned
back
from
following
him
34
But
one
man
shot
his
bow
at
random
and
he
struck
the
king
of
Israel
between
the
joints
of
his
coat
of
mail
So
the
king
said
to
his
charioteer
Turn
around
and
take
me
out
of
the
battle
for
I
have
been
badly
wounded
35
The
fighting
raged
throughout
that
day
and
the
king
had
to
be
propped
up
in
the
chariot
facing
the
Syrians
The
blood
of
the
wound
poured
out
into
the
interior
of
the
war
chariot
and
he
died
in
the
evening
36
Around
sunset
a
cry
passed
through
the
camp
saying
Everyone
to
his
city
Everyone
to
his
land
37
Thus
the
king
died
and
he
was
brought
to
Samaria
they
buried
the
king
in
Samaria
38
When
they
washed
off
the
war
chariot
by
the
pool
of
Samaria
the
dogs
licked
up
his
blood
and
the
prostitutes
bathed
there
according
to
the
word
that
Jehovah
had
spoken
39
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Ahab
all
that
he
did
and
the
house
of
ivory
that
he
built
and
all
the
cities
that
he
built
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
40
Then
Ahab
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
his
son
Ahaziah
became
king
in
his
place
41
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Asa
had
become
king
over
Judah
in
the
fourth
year
of
King
Ahab
of
Israel
42
Jehoshaphat
was
35
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
25
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Azubah
the
daughter
of
Shilhi
43
He
kept
walking
in
all
the
way
of
Asa
his
father
He
did
not
deviate
from
it
and
he
did
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
However
the
high
places
were
not
removed
and
the
people
were
still
sacrificing
and
making
sacrificial
smoke
on
the
high
places
44
Jehoshaphat
kept
peaceful
relations
with
the
king
of
Israel
45
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehoshaphat
his
mighty
exploits
and
how
he
waged
war
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
46
He
also
cleared
out
of
the
land
the
rest
of
the
male
temple
prostitutes
who
had
been
left
over
in
the
days
of
Asa
his
father
47
Then
there
was
no
king
in
Edom
a
deputy
was
acting
as
king
48
Jehoshaphat
also
made
Tarshish
ships
to
go
to
Ophir
for
gold
but
they
did
not
go
because
the
ships
were
wrecked
at
Ezion-geber
49
It
was
then
that
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Ahab
said
to
Jehoshaphat
Let
my
servants
go
with
your
servants
in
the
ships

but
Jehoshaphat
did
not
consent
50
Then
Jehoshaphat
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
his
forefather
and
his
son
Jehoram
became
king
in
his
place
51
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Ahab
became
king
over
Israel
in
Samaria
in
the
17th
year
of
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Judah
and
he
reigned
over
Israel
for
two
years
52
And
he
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
and
walking
in
the
way
of
his
father
and
his
mother
and
in
the
way
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
who
had
caused
Israel
to
sin
53
He
continued
serving
Baal
and
bowing
down
to
him
and
kept
offending
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
just
as
his
father
had
done
1
After
the
death
of
Ahab
Moab
revolted
against
Israel
2
It
was
then
that
Ahaziah
fell
down
through
the
grating
in
his
roof
chamber
in
Samaria
and
was
injured
So
he
sent
messengers
and
said
to
them
Go
inquire
of
Baal-zebub
the
god
of
Ekron
to
find
out
whether
I
will
recover
from
this
injury
3
But
the
angel
of
Jehovah
said
to
Elijah
the
Tishbite
Rise
up
go
to
meet
the
messengers
of
the
king
of
Samaria
and
say
to
them
Is
it
because
there
is
no
God
in
Israel
that
you
are
going
to
inquire
of
Baal-zebub
the
god
of
Ekron
4
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
will
not
leave
the
bed
on
which
you
are
lying
for
you
will
certainly
die
With
that
Elijah
went
off
5
When
the
messengers
returned
to
him
he
immediately
said
to
them
Why
have
you
come
back
6
They
replied
to
him
There
was
a
man
who
came
up
to
meet
us
and
he
said
to
us
Go
return
to
the
king
who
sent
you
and
tell
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Is
it
because
there
is
no
God
in
Israel
that
you
are
sending
to
inquire
of
Baal-zebub
the
god
of
Ekron
Therefore
you
will
not
leave
the
bed
on
which
you
are
lying
for
you
will
certainly
die
7
At
this
he
asked
them
What
did
the
man
look
like
who
came
up
to
meet
you
and
spoke
these
words
to
you
8
So
they
said
to
him
He
was
a
man
with
a
garment
of
hair
and
a
leather
belt
around
his
waist
Immediately
he
said
It
was
Elijah
the
Tishbite
9
The
king
then
sent
to
him
a
chief
of
50
with
his
50
men
When
he
went
up
to
him
he
was
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
He
said
to
him
Man
of
the
true
God
the
king
says
Come
down
10
But
Elijah
answered
the
chief
of
the
50
Well
if
I
am
a
man
of
God
let
fire
come
down
from
the
heavens
and
consume
you
and
your
50
men
And
fire
came
down
from
the
heavens
and
consumed
him
and
his
50
men
11
So
the
king
sent
again
to
him
another
chief
of
50
with
his
50
men
He
went
and
said
to
him
Man
of
the
true
God
this
is
what
the
king
says
Come
down
quickly
12
But
Elijah
answered
them
If
I
am
a
man
of
the
true
God
let
fire
come
down
from
the
heavens
and
consume
you
and
your
50
men
And
fire
of
God
came
down
from
the
heavens
and
consumed
him
and
his
50
men
13
Then
the
king
sent
again
a
third
chief
of
50
and
his
50
men
But
the
third
chief
of
50
went
up
and
bowed
down
on
his
knees
in
front
of
Elijah
and
began
to
beg
for
favor
and
say
to
him
Man
of
the
true
God
please
let
my
life
and
the
lives
of
these
50
servants
of
yours
be
precious
in
your
eyes
14
Fire
has
already
come
down
from
the
heavens
and
consumed
the
two
former
chiefs
of
50
and
their
groups
of
50
but
now
let
my
life
be
precious
in
your
eyes
15
At
that
the
angel
of
Jehovah
told
Elijah
Go
down
with
him
Do
not
be
afraid
of
him
So
he
rose
and
went
down
with
him
to
the
king
16
Elijah
then
said
to
the
king
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
sent
messengers
to
inquire
of
Baal-zebub
the
god
of
Ekron
Is
it
because
there
is
no
God
in
Israel
Why
did
you
not
inquire
of
his
word
Therefore
you
will
not
leave
the
bed
on
which
you
are
lying
for
you
will
certainly
die
17
So
he
died
according
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
that
Elijah
had
spoken
and
because
he
did
not
have
a
son
Jehoram
became
king
in
his
place
in
the
second
year
of
Jehoram
the
son
of
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
18
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Ahaziah
what
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
1
When
Jehovah
was
about
to
take
Elijah
up
to
the
heavens
in
a
windstorm
Elijah
and
Elisha
went
out
from
Gilgal
2
Elijah
said
to
Elisha
Stay
here
please
because
Jehovah
has
sent
me
on
to
Bethel
But
Elisha
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
and
as
you
are
living
I
will
not
leave
you
So
they
went
down
to
Bethel
3
Then
the
sons
of
the
prophets
in
Bethel
came
out
to
Elisha
and
said
to
him
Do
you
know
that
today
Jehovah
is
taking
your
master
away
from
headship
over
you
At
this
he
said
I
already
know
it
Be
silent
4
Elijah
now
said
to
him
Elisha
stay
here
please
because
Jehovah
has
sent
me
on
to
Jericho
But
he
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
and
as
you
are
living
I
will
not
leave
you
So
they
came
to
Jericho
5
Then
the
sons
of
the
prophets
who
were
in
Jericho
approached
Elisha
and
said
to
him
Do
you
know
that
today
Jehovah
is
taking
your
master
away
from
headship
over
you
At
this
he
said
I
already
know
it
Be
silent
6
Elijah
now
said
to
him
Stay
here
please
because
Jehovah
has
sent
me
on
to
the
Jordan
But
he
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
and
as
you
are
living
I
will
not
leave
you
So
both
of
them
went
on
7
And
50
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
also
went
and
stood
watching
from
a
distance
while
the
two
of
them
stood
by
the
Jordan
8
Then
Elijah
took
his
official
garment
and
rolled
it
up
and
struck
the
waters
and
they
were
divided
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
so
that
both
of
them
went
across
on
the
dry
ground
9
As
soon
as
they
had
gone
across
Elijah
said
to
Elisha
Ask
what
you
want
me
to
do
for
you
before
I
am
taken
from
you
So
Elisha
said
Please
may
I
receive
a
double
portion
of
your
spirit
10
He
replied
You
have
asked
a
difficult
thing
If
you
see
me
when
I
am
taken
from
you
it
will
happen
for
you
that
way
but
if
you
do
not
it
will
not
happen
11
As
they
were
walking
along
speaking
as
they
walked
suddenly
a
fiery
chariot
and
fiery
horses
made
a
separation
between
the
two
of
them
and
Elijah
ascended
to
the
heavens
in
the
windstorm
12
While
Elisha
was
watching
he
was
crying
out
My
father
my
father
The
chariot
of
Israel
and
his
horsemen
When
he
could
no
longer
see
him
he
took
hold
of
his
own
garments
and
ripped
them
into
two
pieces
13
After
that
he
picked
up
the
official
garment
of
Elijah
that
had
fallen
off
him
and
went
back
and
stood
by
the
bank
of
the
Jordan
14
Then
he
took
the
official
garment
of
Elijah
that
had
fallen
off
him
and
struck
the
waters
and
said
Where
is
Jehovah
the
God
of
Elijah
When
he
struck
the
waters
they
were
divided
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
so
that
Elisha
went
across
15
When
the
sons
of
the
prophets
at
Jericho
saw
him
from
a
distance
they
said
The
spirit
of
Elijah
has
settled
down
on
Elisha
So
they
went
to
meet
him
and
bowed
down
to
the
ground
before
him
16
They
said
to
him
Here
are
50
capable
men
with
your
servants
Let
them
go
please
to
look
for
your
master
Perhaps
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
has
lifted
him
up
and
then
thrown
him
on
one
of
the
mountains
or
in
one
of
the
valleys
But
he
said
Do
not
send
them
17
However
they
kept
urging
him
until
he
was
embarrassed
so
he
said
Send
them
They
sent
the
50
men
who
kept
looking
for
three
days
but
did
not
find
him
18
When
they
returned
to
him
he
was
staying
in
Jericho
Then
he
said
to
them
Did
I
not
tell
you
not
to
go
19
In
time
the
men
of
the
city
said
to
Elisha
My
master
can
see
that
the
city
is
well-situated
but
the
water
is
bad
and
the
land
is
barren
20
At
that
he
said
Bring
me
a
small
new
bowl
and
put
salt
in
it
So
they
brought
it
to
him
21
Then
he
went
out
to
the
source
of
the
water
and
threw
salt
into
it
and
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
have
healed
this
water
No
more
will
it
cause
death
or
barrenness
22
And
the
water
has
been
healed
down
to
this
day
according
to
the
word
spoken
by
Elisha
23
He
went
up
from
there
to
Bethel
As
he
was
going
along
the
way
some
young
boys
came
out
from
the
city
and
began
to
jeer
at
him
and
they
kept
saying
to
him
Go
up
you
baldhead
Go
up
you
baldhead
24
Finally
he
turned
around
and
looked
at
them
and
cursed
them
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
Then
two
she-bears
came
out
of
the
forest
and
tore
42
of
the
children
to
pieces
25
He
kept
going
from
there
to
Mount
Carmel
and
from
there
he
returned
to
Samaria
1
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
became
king
over
Israel
in
Samaria
in
the
18th
year
of
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Judah
and
he
reigned
for
12
years
2
He
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
but
not
to
the
extent
of
his
father
or
his
mother
for
he
removed
the
sacred
pillar
of
Baal
that
his
father
had
made
3
However
he
clung
to
the
sins
that
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
He
did
not
depart
from
them
4
Now
Mesha
the
king
of
Moab
was
a
sheep
raiser
and
he
used
to
pay
100000
lambs
and
100000
unshorn
rams
as
tribute
to
the
king
of
Israel
5
As
soon
as
Ahab
died
the
king
of
Moab
revolted
against
the
king
of
Israel
6
So
King
Jehoram
went
out
on
that
day
from
Samaria
and
mustered
all
Israel
7
He
also
sent
a
message
to
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Judah
saying
The
king
of
Moab
has
revolted
against
me
Will
you
go
with
me
to
war
against
Moab
To
this
he
said
I
will
go
I
am
the
same
as
you
My
people
are
the
same
as
your
people
My
horses
are
the
same
as
your
horses
8
Then
he
asked
By
which
way
should
we
go
up
He
replied
By
the
way
of
the
wilderness
of
Edom
9
The
king
of
Israel
then
set
out
with
the
king
of
Judah
and
the
king
of
Edom
After
they
journeyed
roundabout
for
seven
days
there
was
no
water
for
the
camp
and
for
the
domestic
animals
that
were
following
behind
them
10
The
king
of
Israel
said
How
terrible
Jehovah
has
called
these
three
kings
only
to
give
them
into
the
hand
of
Moab
11
At
that
Jehoshaphat
said
Is
there
no
prophet
of
Jehovah
here
through
whom
we
may
inquire
of
Jehovah
So
one
of
the
servants
of
the
king
of
Israel
answered
There
is
Elisha
the
son
of
Shaphat
who
used
to
pour
out
water
on
the
hands
of
Elijah
12
Then
Jehoshaphat
said
The
word
of
Jehovah
is
with
him
So
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
and
the
king
of
Edom
went
down
to
him
13
Elisha
said
to
the
king
of
Israel
What
do
I
have
to
do
with
you
Go
to
the
prophets
of
your
father
and
to
the
prophets
of
your
mother
But
the
king
of
Israel
said
to
him
No
for
it
is
Jehovah
who
has
called
these
three
kings
to
give
them
into
the
hand
of
Moab
14
To
this
Elisha
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
of
armies
whom
I
serve
is
living
if
I
did
not
have
regard
for
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Judah
I
would
not
look
at
you
or
take
notice
of
you
15
Now
bring
me
a
harpist
As
soon
as
the
harpist
started
playing
the
hand
of
Jehovah
came
on
him
16
He
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Dig
trench
after
trench
in
this
valley
17
for
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
will
not
see
wind
and
you
will
not
see
rain
yet
this
valley
will
be
filled
with
water
and
you
will
drink
from
it
you
your
livestock
and
your
other
animals
18
But
this
is
a
trivial
thing
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
for
he
will
also
give
Moab
into
your
hand
19
You
must
strike
down
every
fortified
city
and
every
choice
city
you
should
cut
down
every
good
tree
you
should
stop
up
all
the
springs
of
water
and
you
should
ruin
every
good
plot
of
land
with
stones
20
And
in
the
morning
at
the
time
of
the
morning
grain
offering
water
was
suddenly
coming
from
the
direction
of
Edom
and
the
land
became
filled
with
the
water
21
All
the
Moabites
heard
that
the
kings
had
come
up
to
fight
against
them
so
they
called
together
all
the
men
who
could
bear
arms
and
they
stationed
themselves
at
the
border
22
When
they
got
up
early
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
water
and
to
the
Moabites
on
the
opposite
side
the
water
looked
red
like
blood
23
They
said
This
is
blood
The
kings
have
surely
slaughtered
one
another
with
the
sword
So
then
to
the
spoil
O
Moab
24
When
they
came
into
the
camp
of
Israel
the
Israelites
rose
up
and
began
striking
down
the
Moabites
who
fled
from
them
They
advanced
into
Moab
striking
the
Moabites
down
as
they
went
25
They
tore
down
the
cities
and
each
man
threw
a
stone
into
every
good
plot
of
land
filling
it
with
stones
they
stopped
up
every
spring
of
water
and
they
cut
down
every
good
tree
Finally
only
the
stone
walls
of
Kir-hareseth
remained
standing
and
the
slingers
surrounded
it
and
struck
it
down
26
When
the
king
of
Moab
saw
that
the
battle
was
lost
he
took
with
him
700
men
armed
with
swords
to
break
through
to
the
king
of
Edom
but
they
were
not
able
to
27
So
he
took
his
firstborn
son
who
was
going
to
reign
in
his
place
and
offered
him
up
as
a
burnt
sacrifice
on
the
wall
And
there
came
to
be
great
indignation
against
Israel
so
they
withdrew
from
against
him
and
returned
to
their
land
1
Now
one
of
the
wives
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
cried
out
to
Elisha
saying
Your
servant
my
husband
is
dead
and
you
well
know
that
your
servant
had
always
feared
Jehovah
Now
a
creditor
has
come
to
take
both
of
my
children
as
his
slaves
2
At
this
Elisha
said
to
her
What
can
I
do
for
you
Tell
me
what
do
you
have
in
the
house
She
replied
Your
servant
has
nothing
at
all
in
the
house
but
a
jar
of
oil
3
Then
he
said
Go
outside
ask
for
containers
from
all
your
neighbors
empty
containers
Do
not
limit
yourself
to
a
few
4
Then
go
in
and
close
the
door
behind
you
and
your
sons
Fill
all
these
containers
and
set
the
full
ones
aside
5
So
she
left
him
When
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
her
sons
they
passed
the
containers
to
her
and
she
kept
pouring
6
When
the
containers
were
full
she
said
to
one
of
her
sons
Bring
another
container
to
me
But
he
said
to
her
There
are
no
more
containers
At
that
the
oil
stopped
7
So
she
came
in
and
told
the
man
of
the
true
God
and
he
said
Go
sell
the
oil
and
pay
off
your
debts
and
you
and
your
sons
can
live
from
what
is
left
8
One
day
Elisha
went
to
Shunem
where
there
was
a
prominent
woman
and
she
urged
him
to
eat
a
meal
there
As
often
as
he
would
pass
by
he
would
stop
there
to
eat
9
So
she
said
to
her
husband
I
know
that
it
is
a
holy
man
of
God
who
comes
this
way
regularly
10
Please
let
us
make
a
small
room
on
the
roof
and
put
there
for
him
a
bed
a
table
a
chair
and
a
lampstand
Then
whenever
he
comes
to
us
he
can
stay
there
11
One
day
he
came
there
and
he
went
to
the
room
on
the
roof
to
lie
down
12
He
then
said
to
Gehazi
his
attendant
Call
this
Shunammite
woman
So
he
called
her
and
she
stood
before
him
13
Then
he
said
to
Gehazi
Please
tell
her
Here
you
have
gone
to
all
this
trouble
for
us
What
can
be
done
for
you
Should
I
speak
in
your
behalf
to
the
king
or
to
the
chief
of
the
army
But
her
reply
was
I
am
living
among
my
own
people
14
So
he
said
Then
what
can
be
done
for
her
Gehazi
now
said
Well
she
does
not
have
a
son
and
her
husband
is
old
15
Immediately
he
said
Call
her
So
he
called
her
and
she
stood
at
the
doorway
16
Then
he
said
At
this
time
next
year
you
will
be
embracing
a
son
But
she
said
No
my
master
man
of
the
true
God
Do
not
tell
lies
to
your
servant
17
However
the
woman
became
pregnant
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
at
the
same
time
the
next
year
just
as
Elisha
had
told
her
18
The
child
grew
up
and
one
day
he
went
out
to
his
father
who
was
with
the
reapers
19
He
kept
saying
to
his
father
My
head
O
my
head
Then
his
father
said
to
the
attendant
Carry
him
to
his
mother
20
So
he
carried
him
back
to
his
mother
and
he
sat
on
her
lap
until
noon
and
then
he
died
21
Then
she
went
up
and
laid
him
on
the
bed
of
the
man
of
the
true
God
and
she
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
left
22
She
now
called
her
husband
and
said
Send
me
please
one
of
the
attendants
and
one
of
the
donkeys
and
let
me
go
quickly
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
and
return
23
But
he
said
Why
are
you
going
to
see
him
today
It
is
not
a
new
moon
or
a
sabbath
However
she
said
Everything
is
all
right
24
So
she
saddled
the
donkey
and
said
to
her
attendant
Go
quickly
Do
not
slow
down
for
me
unless
I
tell
you
to
25
So
she
went
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
at
Mount
Carmel
As
soon
as
the
man
of
the
true
God
saw
her
from
afar
he
said
to
Gehazi
his
attendant
Look
The
Shunammite
woman
is
over
there
26
Please
run
to
meet
her
and
ask
her
Are
you
well
Is
your
husband
well
Is
your
child
well
To
this
she
said
All
is
well
27
When
she
came
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
at
the
mountain
she
at
once
grabbed
hold
of
his
feet
At
this
Gehazi
came
near
to
push
her
away
but
the
man
of
the
true
God
said
Let
her
alone
for
she
is
in
bitter
distress
and
Jehovah
has
hidden
it
from
me
and
has
not
told
me
28
She
then
said
Did
I
ask
my
lord
for
a
son
Did
I
not
say
You
must
not
give
me
a
false
hope
29
He
immediately
said
to
Gehazi
Wrap
your
garments
around
your
waist
and
take
my
staff
in
your
hand
and
go
If
you
encounter
anyone
do
not
greet
him
and
if
anyone
should
greet
you
do
not
answer
him
Go
and
place
my
staff
on
the
boys
face
30
At
this
the
boys
mother
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
and
as
you
yourself
are
living
I
will
not
leave
you
So
he
got
up
and
went
with
her
31
Gehazi
went
before
them
and
put
the
staff
on
the
boys
face
but
there
was
no
sound
or
response
He
went
back
to
meet
Elisha
and
told
him
The
boy
did
not
wake
up
32
When
Elisha
came
into
the
house
the
boy
was
lying
dead
on
his
bed
33
He
went
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
both
and
began
to
pray
to
Jehovah
34
Then
he
got
up
on
the
bed
and
lay
down
on
the
child
and
put
his
own
mouth
on
the
boys
mouth
his
own
eyes
on
his
eyes
and
his
own
palms
on
his
palms
and
kept
bent
over
him
and
the
childs
body
started
to
grow
warm
35
He
walked
back
and
forth
in
the
house
and
he
got
up
on
the
bed
and
bent
over
him
again
The
boy
sneezed
seven
times
after
which
he
opened
his
eyes
36
Elisha
now
called
Gehazi
and
said
Call
the
Shunammite
woman
So
he
called
her
and
she
came
in
to
him
Then
he
said
Pick
up
your
son
37
And
she
came
in
and
fell
at
his
feet
and
bowed
down
to
the
ground
before
him
after
which
she
picked
up
her
son
and
went
out
38
When
Elisha
returned
to
Gilgal
there
was
famine
in
the
land
The
sons
of
the
prophets
were
sitting
before
him
and
he
said
to
his
attendant
Put
the
large
pot
on
and
boil
stew
for
the
sons
of
the
prophets
39
So
one
of
them
went
out
to
the
field
to
pick
mallows
and
he
found
a
wild
vine
and
picked
wild
gourds
from
it
filling
his
garment
He
then
returned
and
sliced
them
into
the
stewpot
not
knowing
what
they
were
40
They
later
served
it
to
the
men
to
eat
but
as
soon
as
they
ate
from
the
stew
they
cried
out
There
is
death
in
the
pot
O
man
of
the
true
God
And
they
could
not
eat
it
41
So
he
said
Bring
some
flour
After
he
threw
it
into
the
pot
he
said
Serve
it
to
the
people
And
nothing
harmful
was
in
the
pot
42
A
man
came
from
Baal-shalishah
and
he
brought
the
man
of
the
true
God
20
loaves
of
barley
bread
made
from
the
first
ripe
fruits
as
well
as
a
bag
of
new
grain
Then
Elisha
said
Give
it
to
the
people
so
that
they
may
eat
43
However
his
attendant
said
How
can
I
set
this
before
100
men
To
this
he
said
Give
it
to
the
people
so
that
they
may
eat
for
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
They
will
eat
and
have
some
left
over
44
At
that
he
put
it
before
them
and
they
ate
and
they
had
some
left
over
according
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
1
Now
Naaman
the
army
chief
of
the
king
of
Syria
was
a
prominent
man
who
was
held
in
esteem
by
his
lord
because
through
him
Jehovah
had
given
victory
to
Syria
He
was
a
mighty
warrior
although
he
was
a
leper
2
On
one
of
their
raids
the
Syrians
had
taken
captive
from
the
land
of
Israel
a
little
girl
who
became
a
servant
to
Naamans
wife
3
She
said
to
her
mistress
If
only
my
lord
would
visit
the
prophet
in
Samaria
Then
he
would
cure
him
of
his
leprosy
4
So
he
went
and
reported
to
his
lord
telling
him
what
the
girl
from
Israel
had
said
5
Then
the
king
of
Syria
said
Go
now
And
I
will
send
a
letter
to
the
king
of
Israel
So
he
went
taking
with
him
ten
talents
of
silver
6000
pieces
of
gold
and
ten
changes
of
garments
6
He
brought
to
the
king
of
Israel
the
letter
which
read
Along
with
this
letter
that
has
come
to
you
I
send
my
servant
Naaman
so
that
you
may
cure
him
of
his
leprosy
7
As
soon
as
the
king
of
Israel
read
the
letter
he
ripped
his
garments
apart
and
said
Am
I
God
to
put
to
death
and
to
keep
alive
For
he
is
sending
this
man
to
me
telling
me
to
cure
him
of
his
leprosy
You
can
see
for
yourselves
that
he
is
seeking
a
quarrel
with
me
8
But
when
Elisha
the
man
of
the
true
God
heard
that
the
king
of
Israel
had
ripped
his
garments
apart
he
at
once
sent
word
to
the
king
Why
did
you
rip
your
garments
apart
Please
let
him
come
to
me
so
that
he
may
know
that
there
is
a
prophet
in
Israel
9
So
Naaman
came
with
his
horses
and
his
war
chariots
and
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
of
Elisha
10
However
Elisha
sent
a
messenger
to
tell
him
Go
wash
seven
times
in
the
Jordan
and
your
flesh
will
be
restored
and
you
will
be
clean
11
At
this
Naaman
became
indignant
and
started
to
leave
saying
Here
I
said
to
myself
He
will
come
out
to
me
and
stand
here
and
call
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
his
God
moving
his
hand
back
and
forth
over
the
leprosy
to
cure
it
12
Are
not
the
Abanah
and
the
Pharpar
the
rivers
of
Damascus
better
than
all
the
waters
of
Israel
Can
I
not
wash
in
them
and
become
clean
With
that
he
turned
and
went
away
in
a
rage
13
His
servants
now
approached
him
and
said
My
father
if
the
prophet
had
told
you
to
do
something
extraordinary
would
you
not
do
it
How
much
more
then
since
he
only
said
to
you
Wash
and
be
clean
14
At
that
he
went
down
and
plunged
into
the
Jordan
seven
times
according
to
the
word
of
the
man
of
the
true
God
Then
his
flesh
was
restored
like
the
flesh
of
a
little
boy
and
he
became
clean
15
After
that
he
went
back
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
he
and
all
his
entourage
and
he
stood
before
him
and
said
Now
I
know
that
there
is
no
God
anywhere
in
all
the
earth
but
in
Israel
Now
accept
please
a
gift
from
your
servant
16
However
Elisha
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
whom
I
serve
is
living
I
will
not
accept
it
He
urged
him
to
accept
it
but
he
kept
refusing
17
Finally
Naaman
said
If
not
please
let
your
servant
be
given
two
mule-loads
of
soil
from
this
land
for
your
servant
will
no
longer
offer
a
burnt
offering
or
a
sacrifice
to
any
gods
other
than
Jehovah
18
But
may
Jehovah
forgive
your
servant
for
this
one
thing
When
my
lord
goes
into
the
house
of
Rimmon
to
bow
down
there
he
supports
himself
on
my
arm
so
I
have
to
bow
down
at
the
house
of
Rimmon
When
I
bow
down
at
the
house
of
Rimmon
may
Jehovah
please
forgive
your
servant
for
this
19
At
this
he
said
to
him
Go
in
peace
After
he
departed
from
him
and
had
traveled
for
some
distance
20
Gehazi
the
attendant
of
Elisha
the
man
of
the
true
God
said
to
himself
Here
my
master
has
spared
this
Syrian
Naaman
by
not
accepting
from
him
what
he
brought
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
I
will
run
after
him
and
take
something
from
him
21
So
Gehazi
chased
after
Naaman
When
Naaman
saw
someone
running
after
him
he
got
down
from
his
chariot
to
meet
him
and
said
Is
everything
all
right
22
To
this
he
said
All
is
well
My
master
has
sent
me
saying
Look
Just
now
two
young
men
from
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
from
the
sons
of
the
prophets
came
to
me
Give
them
please
a
talent
of
silver
and
two
changes
of
garments
23
Naaman
said
Go
on
take
two
talents
He
kept
urging
him
and
he
wrapped
up
two
talents
of
silver
in
two
bags
with
two
changes
of
garments
and
gave
them
to
two
of
his
attendants
who
carried
them
before
him
24
When
he
reached
Ophel
he
took
them
from
their
hand
and
put
them
in
the
house
and
sent
the
men
away
After
they
left
25
he
went
in
and
stood
by
his
master
Elisha
now
said
to
him
Where
did
you
come
from
Gehazi
But
he
said
Your
servant
did
not
go
anywhere
26
Elisha
said
to
him
Was
my
heart
not
there
with
you
when
the
man
got
down
from
his
chariot
to
meet
you
Is
it
a
time
to
accept
silver
or
to
accept
garments
or
olive
groves
or
vineyards
or
sheep
or
cattle
or
male
or
female
servants
27
Now
Naamans
leprosy
will
stick
to
you
and
your
descendants
forever
Immediately
he
went
out
from
before
him
a
leper
white
as
snow
1
The
sons
of
the
prophets
said
to
Elisha
Look
The
place
where
we
are
staying
with
you
is
too
cramped
for
us
2
Please
let
us
go
to
the
Jordan
Let
each
of
us
take
a
log
from
there
and
make
a
place
there
where
we
can
dwell
He
said
Go
3
One
of
them
said
Will
you
please
come
along
with
your
servants
At
that
he
said
I
will
come
4
So
he
went
with
them
and
they
came
to
the
Jordan
and
began
to
cut
down
the
trees
5
As
one
of
them
was
cutting
down
a
tree
the
axhead
fell
into
the
water
and
he
cried
out
Alas
my
master
it
was
borrowed
6
The
man
of
the
true
God
said
Where
did
it
fall
So
he
showed
him
the
place
He
then
cut
off
a
piece
of
wood
and
threw
it
there
and
made
the
axhead
float
7
He
said
Lift
it
out
So
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
it
8
Now
the
king
of
Syria
went
to
war
against
Israel
He
consulted
with
his
servants
and
said
I
will
encamp
at
such
and
such
a
place
with
you
9
Then
the
man
of
the
true
God
sent
word
to
the
king
of
Israel
saying
Beware
of
passing
by
this
place
because
that
is
where
the
Syrians
are
coming
down
10
So
the
king
of
Israel
sent
word
to
the
place
that
the
man
of
the
true
God
had
warned
him
about
He
kept
warning
him
and
he
stayed
away
from
there
on
several
occasions
11
This
enraged
the
king
of
Syria
so
he
summoned
his
servants
and
said
to
them
Tell
me
Who
among
us
is
on
the
side
of
the
king
of
Israel
12
Then
one
of
his
servants
said
None
of
us
my
lord
the
king
It
is
Elisha
the
prophet
in
Israel
who
tells
the
king
of
Israel
the
things
that
you
say
in
your
own
bedroom
13
He
said
Go
and
find
out
where
he
is
so
that
I
may
send
men
to
capture
him
Later
the
report
was
made
to
him
He
is
in
Dothan
14
He
immediately
sent
horses
and
war
chariots
there
as
well
as
a
large
army
they
came
by
night
and
surrounded
the
city
15
When
the
attendant
of
the
man
of
the
true
God
rose
early
and
went
outside
he
saw
that
an
army
with
horses
and
war
chariots
was
surrounding
the
city
At
once
the
attendant
said
to
him
Alas
my
master
What
are
we
to
do
16
But
he
said
Do
not
be
afraid
For
there
are
more
who
are
with
us
than
those
who
are
with
them
17
Then
Elisha
began
to
pray
and
say
O
Jehovah
open
his
eyes
please
that
he
may
see
Immediately
Jehovah
opened
the
attendants
eyes
and
he
saw
and
look
the
mountainous
region
was
full
of
horses
and
war
chariots
of
fire
all
around
Elisha
18
When
the
Syrians
came
down
to
him
Elisha
prayed
to
Jehovah
and
said
Please
strike
this
nation
with
blindness
So
he
struck
them
with
blindness
just
as
Elisha
had
requested
19
Elisha
now
said
to
them
This
is
not
the
way
and
this
is
not
the
city
Follow
me
and
let
me
lead
you
to
the
man
you
are
looking
for
However
he
led
them
to
Samaria
20
When
they
arrived
in
Samaria
Elisha
said
O
Jehovah
open
their
eyes
so
that
they
may
see
So
Jehovah
opened
their
eyes
and
they
saw
that
they
were
in
the
middle
of
Samaria
21
When
the
king
of
Israel
saw
them
he
said
to
Elisha
Should
I
strike
them
down
should
I
strike
them
down
my
father
22
But
he
said
You
must
not
strike
them
down
Do
you
strike
down
those
whom
you
have
taken
captive
with
your
sword
and
with
your
bow
Give
them
bread
and
water
so
they
may
eat
and
drink
and
return
to
their
lord
23
So
he
spread
a
great
feast
for
them
and
they
ate
and
drank
after
which
he
sent
them
away
to
return
to
their
lord
And
not
once
did
the
marauder
bands
of
the
Syrians
come
again
into
the
land
of
Israel
24
Afterward
Ben-hadad
the
king
of
Syria
gathered
all
his
army
together
and
went
up
and
besieged
Samaria
25
So
there
was
a
great
famine
in
Samaria
and
they
besieged
it
until
a
donkeys
head
was
worth
80
silver
pieces
and
a
fourth
of
a
cab
measure
of
doves
droppings
was
worth
5
silver
pieces
26
As
the
king
of
Israel
was
passing
by
on
the
wall
a
woman
cried
out
to
him
Help
us
O
my
lord
the
king
27
To
this
he
said
If
Jehovah
does
not
help
you
where
can
I
get
help
for
you
From
the
threshing
floor
Or
from
the
wine
or
oil
press
28
The
king
asked
her
What
is
the
matter
with
you
She
replied
This
woman
said
to
me
Hand
over
your
son
and
we
will
eat
him
today
and
we
will
eat
my
son
tomorrow
29
So
we
boiled
my
son
and
ate
him
The
next
day
I
said
to
her
Hand
over
your
son
so
that
we
may
eat
him
But
she
hid
her
son
30
As
soon
as
the
king
heard
the
womans
words
he
ripped
his
garments
apart
When
he
passed
by
on
the
wall
the
people
saw
that
he
was
wearing
sackcloth
under
his
clothes
31
Then
he
said
So
may
God
do
to
me
and
add
to
it
if
the
head
of
Elisha
the
son
of
Shaphat
remains
on
him
today
32
Elisha
was
sitting
in
his
house
and
the
elders
were
sitting
with
him
The
king
sent
a
man
ahead
of
him
but
before
the
messenger
arrived
Elisha
said
to
the
elders
Have
you
seen
how
this
son
of
a
murderer
has
sent
to
take
off
my
head
Watch
when
the
messenger
comes
close
the
door
and
hold
the
door
shut
against
him
Is
not
the
sound
of
his
lords
footsteps
behind
him
33
While
he
was
still
speaking
with
them
the
messenger
came
to
him
and
the
king
said
This
calamity
is
from
Jehovah
Why
should
I
wait
any
longer
for
Jehovah
1
Elisha
now
said
Listen
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Tomorrow
about
this
time
at
the
gate
of
Samaria
a
seah
measure
of
fine
flour
will
be
worth
a
shekel
and
two
seah
measures
of
barley
will
be
worth
a
shekel
2
At
that
the
adjutant
whom
the
king
relied
on
said
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
Even
if
Jehovah
should
open
floodgates
in
the
heavens
could
this
possibly
take
place
To
that
he
said
You
will
see
it
with
your
own
eyes
but
you
will
not
eat
from
it
3
There
were
four
lepers
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
gate
and
they
said
to
one
another
Why
are
we
sitting
here
until
we
die
4
If
we
say
Let
us
go
into
the
city

while
the
famine
is
in
the
city
we
would
die
there
And
if
we
sit
here
we
will
die
anyway
So
now
let
us
go
over
to
the
camp
of
the
Syrians
If
they
spare
our
lives
we
will
live
but
if
they
put
us
to
death
then
we
will
die
5
They
then
got
up
in
the
evening
darkness
and
entered
the
camp
of
the
Syrians
When
they
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
Syrian
camp
there
was
nobody
there
6
For
Jehovah
had
caused
the
Syrian
camp
to
hear
the
sound
of
war
chariots
and
horses
the
sound
of
a
huge
army
So
they
said
to
one
another
Look
The
king
of
Israel
has
hired
the
kings
of
the
Hittites
and
the
kings
of
Egypt
to
come
against
us
7
They
immediately
got
up
and
fled
in
the
evening
darkness
leaving
their
tents
horses
donkeys
and
the
whole
camp
just
as
it
was
and
they
fled
for
their
lives
8
When
these
lepers
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
they
entered
into
one
of
the
tents
and
began
to
eat
and
drink
They
carried
away
from
there
silver
gold
and
garments
and
went
and
hid
them
Then
they
returned
and
entered
another
tent
and
carried
things
away
from
there
and
went
and
hid
them
9
Finally
they
said
to
one
another
What
we
are
doing
is
not
right
This
day
is
a
day
of
good
news
If
we
hesitate
and
wait
until
dawn
we
will
deserve
to
be
punished
Let
us
now
go
and
report
this
at
the
kings
house
10
So
they
went
and
called
out
to
the
gatekeepers
of
the
city
and
reported
to
them
We
went
into
the
camp
of
the
Syrians
but
nobody
was
there—we
did
not
hear
anyone
at
all
There
were
only
the
horses
and
donkeys
tied
and
the
tents
left
just
as
they
were
11
At
once
the
gatekeepers
called
out
and
it
was
reported
inside
the
kings
house
12
Immediately
the
king
got
up
by
night
and
said
to
his
servants
Please
let
me
tell
you
what
the
Syrians
have
done
to
us
They
know
that
we
are
hungry
so
they
left
the
camp
to
hide
in
the
field
saying
They
will
come
out
of
the
city
and
we
will
catch
them
alive
and
enter
into
the
city
13
Then
one
of
his
servants
said
Please
let
some
men
take
five
of
the
remaining
horses
that
are
in
the
city
Look
They
will
end
up
the
same
as
all
the
crowd
of
Israel
that
remain
here
Look
They
will
end
up
the
same
as
all
the
crowd
of
Israel
that
perished
Let
us
then
send
them
out
and
see
14
So
they
took
two
chariots
with
horses
and
the
king
sent
them
out
to
the
camp
of
the
Syrians
saying
Go
and
see
15
They
followed
them
as
far
as
the
Jordan
and
the
entire
way
was
covered
with
garments
and
utensils
that
the
Syrians
had
thrown
away
as
they
fled
in
panic
The
messengers
returned
and
reported
it
to
the
king
16
The
people
then
went
out
and
plundered
the
camp
of
the
Syrians
so
that
a
seah
measure
of
fine
flour
came
to
be
worth
a
shekel
and
two
seah
measures
of
barley
came
to
be
worth
a
shekel
according
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
17
The
king
had
appointed
the
adjutant
whom
he
relied
on
to
be
in
charge
of
the
gate
but
the
people
trampled
him
to
death
at
the
gate
just
as
the
man
of
the
true
God
had
told
the
king
when
he
came
down
to
him
18
It
happened
just
as
the
man
of
the
true
God
had
said
to
the
king
Two
seah
measures
of
barley
will
be
worth
a
shekel
and
a
seah
measure
of
fine
flour
will
be
worth
a
shekel
tomorrow
at
this
time
at
the
gate
of
Samaria
19
But
the
adjutant
had
said
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
Even
if
Jehovah
should
open
floodgates
in
the
heavens
could
such
a
thing
take
place
To
this
Elisha
had
said
You
will
see
it
with
your
own
eyes
but
you
will
not
eat
from
it
20
That
is
exactly
what
happened
to
him
because
the
people
trampled
him
to
death
at
the
gate
1
Elisha
said
to
the
woman
whose
son
he
had
restored
to
life
Rise
up
and
go
you
with
your
household
and
live
as
a
foreigner
wherever
you
can
for
Jehovah
has
declared
a
famine
and
it
will
come
on
the
land
for
seven
years
2
So
the
woman
got
up
and
did
what
the
man
of
the
true
God
said
She
went
with
her
household
and
settled
in
the
land
of
the
Philistines
for
seven
years
3
At
the
end
of
seven
years
the
woman
returned
from
the
land
of
the
Philistines
and
went
to
appeal
to
the
king
for
her
house
and
her
field
4
Now
the
king
was
speaking
to
Gehazi
the
attendant
of
the
man
of
the
true
God
saying
Relate
to
me
please
all
the
great
things
that
Elisha
has
done
5
Just
as
he
was
relating
to
the
king
how
he
had
restored
the
dead
one
to
life
the
woman
whose
son
he
had
restored
to
life
came
to
the
king
appealing
for
her
house
and
her
field
At
once
Gehazi
said
My
lord
the
king
this
is
the
woman
and
this
is
her
son
whom
Elisha
restored
to
life
6
At
that
the
king
asked
the
woman
and
she
related
the
story
to
him
Then
the
king
assigned
her
a
court
official
telling
him
Return
all
that
belongs
to
her
and
all
the
products
of
the
field
from
the
day
she
left
the
land
until
now
7
Elisha
came
to
Damascus
when
Ben-hadad
the
king
of
Syria
was
sick
So
the
report
was
made
to
him
The
man
of
the
true
God
has
come
here
8
At
that
the
king
said
to
Hazael
Take
a
gift
with
you
and
go
and
meet
the
man
of
the
true
God
Inquire
of
Jehovah
through
him
asking
Will
I
recover
from
this
sickness
9
Hazael
went
to
meet
him
and
took
a
gift
with
him
every
sort
of
good
thing
of
Damascus
the
load
of
40
camels
He
came
and
stood
before
him
and
said
Your
son
Ben-hadad
the
king
of
Syria
has
sent
me
to
you
asking
Will
I
recover
from
this
sickness
10
Elisha
replied
to
him
Go
and
tell
him
You
will
certainly
recover

but
Jehovah
has
shown
me
that
he
will
certainly
die
11
And
he
kept
staring
at
him
to
the
point
of
embarrassment
Then
the
man
of
the
true
God
gave
way
to
weeping
12
Hazael
asked
Why
is
my
lord
weeping
He
replied
Because
I
know
what
harm
you
will
do
to
the
people
of
Israel
Their
fortified
places
you
will
set
on
fire
their
choice
men
you
will
kill
with
the
sword
their
children
you
will
dash
to
pieces
and
their
pregnant
women
you
will
rip
open
13
Hazael
said
How
could
your
servant
who
is
a
mere
dog
do
such
a
deed
But
Elisha
said
Jehovah
has
shown
me
that
you
will
be
king
over
Syria
14
Then
he
left
Elisha
and
returned
to
his
own
lord
who
said
to
him
What
did
Elisha
say
to
you
He
replied
He
told
me
that
you
will
certainly
recover
15
But
the
next
day
Hazael
took
a
coverlet
dipped
it
in
water
and
held
it
over
his
face
until
he
died
And
Hazael
became
king
in
his
place
16
In
the
fifth
year
of
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
the
king
of
Israel
while
Jehoshaphat
was
king
of
Judah
Jehoram
the
son
of
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Judah
became
king
17
He
was
32
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
eight
years
in
Jerusalem
18
He
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
Israel
just
as
those
of
the
house
of
Ahab
had
done
for
Ahabs
daughter
had
become
his
wife
and
he
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
19
But
Jehovah
did
not
want
to
bring
Judah
to
ruin
for
the
sake
of
David
his
servant
since
he
had
promised
him
to
give
a
lamp
to
him
and
to
his
sons
always
20
In
his
days
Edom
revolted
against
Judah
and
then
set
up
its
own
king
21
So
Jehoram
crossed
over
to
Zair
with
all
his
chariots
and
he
rose
up
by
night
and
defeated
the
Edomites
who
were
surrounding
him
and
the
chariot
commanders
and
the
troops
fled
to
their
tents
22
But
Edom
has
kept
up
its
revolt
against
Judah
to
this
day
Libnah
also
revolted
at
that
time
23
And
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehoram
all
that
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
24
Then
Jehoram
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
And
his
son
Ahaziah
became
king
in
his
place
25
In
the
12th
year
of
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
the
king
of
Israel
Ahaziah
the
son
of
King
Jehoram
of
Judah
became
king
26
Ahaziah
was
22
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
one
year
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Athaliah
the
granddaughter
of
King
Omri
of
Israel
27
He
walked
in
the
way
of
the
house
of
Ahab
and
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
like
the
house
of
Ahab
for
he
was
related
to
the
house
of
Ahab
by
marriage
28
So
he
went
with
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
to
wage
war
against
King
Hazael
of
Syria
at
Ramoth-gilead
but
the
Syrians
wounded
Jehoram
29
So
King
Jehoram
returned
to
Jezreel
to
recover
from
the
wounds
that
the
Syrians
had
inflicted
on
him
at
Ramah
when
he
fought
against
King
Hazael
of
Syria
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Jehoram
the
king
of
Judah
went
down
to
Jezreel
to
see
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
because
he
had
been
wounded
1
Elisha
the
prophet
then
called
one
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
and
said
to
him
Wrap
your
garments
around
your
waist
and
quickly
take
this
flask
of
oil
with
you
and
go
to
Ramoth-gilead
2
When
you
arrive
there
look
for
Jehu
the
son
of
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Nimshi
go
in
and
have
him
get
up
from
among
his
brothers
and
take
him
into
the
innermost
room
3
Then
take
the
flask
of
oil
and
pour
it
out
on
his
head
and
say
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
anoint
you
as
king
over
Israel
Then
open
the
door
and
flee
without
delay
4
So
the
prophets
attendant
got
on
his
way
to
Ramoth-gilead
5
When
he
arrived
the
army
chiefs
were
seated
there
He
said
I
have
a
message
for
you
O
chief
Jehu
asked
For
which
one
of
us
He
said
For
you
O
chief
6
So
Jehu
got
up
and
went
into
the
house
the
attendant
poured
the
oil
out
on
his
head
and
said
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
I
anoint
you
as
king
over
Jehovahs
people
over
Israel
7
You
must
strike
down
the
house
of
Ahab
your
lord
and
I
will
avenge
the
blood
of
my
servants
the
prophets
and
of
all
the
servants
of
Jehovah
who
died
at
the
hands
of
Jezebel
8
And
the
whole
house
of
Ahab
will
perish
and
I
will
annihilate
from
Ahab
every
male
including
the
helpless
and
weak
in
Israel
9
And
I
will
make
the
house
of
Ahab
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
and
like
the
house
of
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah
10
As
for
Jezebel
the
dogs
will
eat
her
up
in
the
plot
of
land
at
Jezreel
and
no
one
will
bury
her
With
that
he
opened
the
door
and
fled
11
When
Jehu
went
back
to
the
servants
of
his
lord
they
asked
him
Is
everything
all
right
Why
did
this
crazy
man
come
to
you
He
answered
them
You
know
that
sort
of
man
and
his
sort
of
talk
12
But
they
said
That
is
not
true
Tell
us
please
Then
he
said
This
is
what
he
said
to
me
and
then
he
added
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
anoint
you
as
king
over
Israel
13
At
this
each
of
them
quickly
took
his
garment
and
put
it
under
him
on
the
bare
steps
and
they
blew
the
horn
and
said
Jehu
has
become
king
14
Then
Jehu
the
son
of
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Nimshi
conspired
against
Jehoram
Jehoram
had
been
on
guard
at
Ramoth-gilead
he
with
all
Israel
because
of
King
Hazael
of
Syria
15
King
Jehoram
later
returned
to
Jezreel
to
recover
from
the
wounds
that
the
Syrians
inflicted
on
him
when
he
fought
King
Hazael
of
Syria
Jehu
now
said
If
you
agree
do
not
let
anyone
escape
from
the
city
to
go
and
report
this
in
Jezreel
16
Then
Jehu
mounted
his
chariot
and
went
to
Jezreel
for
Jehoram
was
lying
there
wounded
and
King
Ahaziah
of
Judah
had
gone
down
to
see
Jehoram
17
As
the
watchman
was
standing
on
the
tower
in
Jezreel
he
saw
the
throng
of
Jehus
men
approaching
At
once
he
said
I
see
a
throng
of
men
Jehoram
said
Take
a
cavalryman
and
send
him
to
meet
them
and
let
him
say
Are
you
coming
in
peace
18
So
a
horseman
went
to
meet
him
and
said
This
is
what
the
king
says
Are
you
coming
in
peace
But
Jehu
said
What
do
you
have
to
do
with
peace
Fall
in
behind
me
The
watchman
then
reported
The
messenger
reached
them
but
he
has
not
returned
19
So
he
sent
out
a
second
horseman
who
said
when
he
came
to
them
This
is
what
the
king
says
Are
you
coming
in
peace
But
Jehu
said
What
do
you
have
to
do
with
peace
Fall
in
behind
me
20
The
watchman
then
reported
He
reached
them
but
he
has
not
returned
and
the
driving
is
like
the
driving
of
Jehu
the
grandson
of
Nimshi
for
he
drives
like
a
madman
21
Jehoram
said
Hitch
up
So
his
war
chariot
was
hitched
up
and
King
Jehoram
of
Israel
and
King
Ahaziah
of
Judah
each
went
out
in
his
own
war
chariot
to
meet
Jehu
They
encountered
him
in
the
plot
of
land
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
22
As
soon
as
Jehoram
saw
Jehu
he
said
Are
you
coming
in
peace
Jehu
But
he
said
What
peace
could
there
be
as
long
as
there
is
the
prostitution
of
Jezebel
your
mother
and
her
many
sorceries
23
At
once
Jehoram
turned
his
chariot
to
flee
and
he
said
to
Ahaziah
We
have
been
tricked
Ahaziah
24
Jehu
took
his
bow
in
hand
and
shot
Jehoram
between
the
shoulders
and
the
arrow
came
out
at
his
heart
and
he
collapsed
in
his
war
chariot
25
He
then
said
to
Bidkar
his
adjutant
Pick
him
up
and
throw
him
into
the
field
of
Naboth
the
Jezreelite
Remember
you
and
I
were
riding
together
behind
Ahab
his
father
when
Jehovah
himself
made
this
pronouncement
against
him
26
As
surely
as
I
saw
the
blood
of
Naboth
and
the
blood
of
his
sons
yesterday

declares
Jehovah
I
will
repay
you
in
this
very
plot
of
land

declares
Jehovah
So
now
pick
him
up
and
throw
him
into
the
plot
of
land
according
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
27
When
King
Ahaziah
of
Judah
saw
what
was
happening
he
fled
by
way
of
the
garden
house
Later
Jehu
pursued
him
and
said
Strike
him
down
also
So
they
struck
him
down
in
the
chariot
on
his
way
up
to
Gur
which
is
by
Ibleam
But
he
continued
his
flight
to
Megiddo
and
died
there
28
Then
his
servants
carried
him
in
a
chariot
to
Jerusalem
and
they
buried
him
in
his
grave
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
29
It
was
in
the
11th
year
of
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
that
Ahaziah
had
become
king
over
Judah
30
When
Jehu
came
to
Jezreel
Jezebel
heard
of
it
So
she
painted
her
eyes
with
black
paint
and
adorned
her
head
and
looked
down
through
the
window
31
As
Jehu
came
in
through
the
gate
she
said
Did
it
go
well
with
Zimri
the
killer
of
his
lord
32
Looking
up
to
the
window
he
said
Who
is
on
my
side
Who
Immediately
two
or
three
court
officials
looked
down
at
him
33
He
said
Throw
her
down
So
they
threw
her
down
and
some
of
her
blood
splattered
on
the
wall
and
on
the
horses
and
he
trampled
her
34
After
that
he
went
in
and
ate
and
drank
He
then
said
Please
take
care
of
this
accursed
woman
and
bury
her
After
all
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
king
35
But
when
they
went
to
bury
her
they
did
not
find
anything
but
her
skull
and
her
feet
and
the
palms
of
her
hands
36
When
they
returned
and
told
him
he
said
This
fulfills
the
word
of
Jehovah
that
he
spoke
through
his
servant
Elijah
the
Tishbite
saying
In
the
plot
of
land
of
Jezreel
the
dogs
will
eat
the
flesh
of
Jezebel
37
And
the
dead
body
of
Jezebel
will
become
as
manure
on
the
surface
of
the
field
in
the
plot
of
land
of
Jezreel
so
that
they
may
not
say
This
is
Jezebel
1
Now
Ahab
had
70
sons
in
Samaria
So
Jehu
wrote
letters
and
sent
them
to
Samaria
to
the
princes
of
Jezreel
the
elders
and
the
guardians
of
Ahabs
children
saying
2
Now
when
this
letter
comes
to
you
the
sons
of
your
lord
will
be
with
you
as
well
as
the
war
chariots
the
horses
a
fortified
city
and
weapons
3
Select
the
best
and
most
suitable
of
the
sons
of
your
lord
and
put
him
on
the
throne
of
his
father
Then
fight
for
the
house
of
your
lord
4
But
they
were
overcome
with
fear
and
said
Look
If
two
kings
could
not
stand
before
him
how
can
we
stand
5
So
the
overseer
of
the
palace
the
governor
of
the
city
the
elders
and
the
guardians
sent
this
message
to
Jehu
We
are
your
servants
and
we
will
do
everything
that
you
tell
us
We
will
not
make
anyone
king
Do
whatever
seems
good
in
your
eyes
6
Then
he
wrote
them
a
second
letter
saying
If
you
belong
to
me
and
are
willing
to
obey
me
bring
the
heads
of
the
sons
of
your
lord
and
come
to
me
tomorrow
at
this
time
at
Jezreel
Now
the
70
sons
of
the
king
were
with
the
distinguished
men
of
the
city
who
were
raising
them
7
As
soon
as
the
letter
came
to
them
they
took
the
sons
of
the
king
and
slaughtered
them
70
men
and
they
put
their
heads
in
baskets
and
sent
them
to
him
at
Jezreel
8
The
messenger
came
in
and
told
him
They
have
brought
the
heads
of
the
sons
of
the
king
So
he
said
Put
them
in
two
heaps
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
gate
until
morning
9
When
he
went
out
in
the
morning
he
stood
before
all
the
people
and
said
You
are
innocent
Yes
I
conspired
against
my
lord
and
I
killed
him
but
who
struck
down
all
of
these
10
Know
then
that
not
a
single
word
of
Jehovahs
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
against
the
house
of
Ahab
will
go
unfulfilled
and
Jehovah
has
done
what
he
spoke
through
his
servant
Elijah
11
Moreover
Jehu
struck
down
all
who
were
left
of
the
house
of
Ahab
in
Jezreel
as
well
as
all
his
distinguished
men
his
acquaintances
and
his
priests
until
he
had
left
him
no
survivor
12
Then
he
got
up
and
went
on
his
way
to
Samaria
The
binding
house
of
the
shepherds
was
on
the
way
13
There
Jehu
encountered
the
brothers
of
King
Ahaziah
of
Judah
and
he
said
to
them
Who
are
you
They
said
We
are
the
brothers
of
Ahaziah
and
we
are
on
our
way
down
to
ask
if
all
is
well
with
the
sons
of
the
king
and
the
sons
of
the
queen
mother
14
Immediately
he
said
Capture
them
alive
So
they
captured
them
alive
and
slaughtered
them
at
the
cistern
of
the
binding
house
42
men
He
did
not
let
a
single
one
of
them
survive
15
As
he
went
from
there
he
encountered
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
who
was
coming
to
meet
him
When
he
greeted
him
he
said
to
him
Is
your
heart
fully
with
me
just
as
my
heart
is
with
your
heart
Jehonadab
replied
It
is
If
so
give
me
your
hand
So
he
gave
him
his
hand
and
Jehu
pulled
him
up
into
the
chariot
with
him
16
Then
he
said
Come
along
with
me
and
see
my
toleration
of
no
rivalry
toward
Jehovah
So
they
had
him
ride
with
him
in
his
war
chariot
17
Then
he
came
to
Samaria
and
he
struck
down
all
who
were
left
over
of
Ahabs
house
in
Samaria
until
he
had
annihilated
them
according
to
Jehovahs
word
that
he
had
spoken
to
Elijah
18
Further
Jehu
collected
all
the
people
together
and
said
to
them
Ahab
worshipped
Baal
a
little
but
Jehu
will
worship
him
much
more
19
So
summon
all
the
prophets
of
Baal
all
his
worshippers
and
all
his
priests
to
me
Do
not
let
a
single
one
be
absent
because
I
have
a
great
sacrifice
for
Baal
Anyone
who
is
absent
will
not
live
But
Jehu
was
acting
with
cunning
to
destroy
the
worshippers
of
Baal
20
Jehu
continued
Declare
a
solemn
assembly
for
Baal
So
they
proclaimed
it
21
After
that
Jehu
sent
word
throughout
Israel
and
all
the
worshippers
of
Baal
came
Not
a
single
one
was
left
out
who
did
not
come
They
entered
the
house
of
Baal
and
the
house
of
Baal
was
filled
from
end
to
end
22
He
said
to
the
one
who
was
in
charge
of
the
wardrobe
Bring
out
garments
for
all
the
worshippers
of
Baal
So
he
brought
out
the
clothing
for
them
23
Then
Jehu
and
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
went
into
the
house
of
Baal
He
now
said
to
the
worshippers
of
Baal
Search
carefully
and
see
that
there
are
no
worshippers
of
Jehovah
here
only
worshippers
of
Baal
24
Finally
they
came
in
to
offer
up
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
Jehu
had
stationed
80
of
his
men
outside
and
said
If
any
one
of
the
men
I
am
putting
into
your
hands
escapes
it
will
be
your
life
for
his
25
As
soon
as
he
finished
offering
up
the
burnt
offering
Jehu
said
to
the
guards
and
the
adjutants
Come
in
and
strike
them
down
Do
not
let
a
single
one
escape
So
the
guards
and
the
adjutants
struck
them
down
with
the
sword
and
threw
them
out
and
they
kept
going
as
far
as
the
inner
sanctuary
of
the
house
of
Baal
26
Then
they
brought
out
the
sacred
pillars
of
the
house
of
Baal
and
burned
each
one
27
They
tore
down
the
sacred
pillar
of
Baal
and
they
tore
down
the
house
of
Baal
and
turned
it
into
latrines
as
it
remains
to
this
day
28
Thus
Jehu
annihilated
Baal
out
of
Israel
29
However
Jehu
did
not
turn
away
from
the
sins
that
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
as
regards
the
golden
calves
that
were
in
Bethel
and
in
Dan
30
So
Jehovah
said
to
Jehu
Because
you
have
acted
well
and
have
done
what
is
right
in
my
eyes
by
carrying
out
all
that
was
in
my
heart
to
do
to
the
house
of
Ahab
four
generations
of
your
sons
will
sit
on
the
throne
of
Israel
31
But
Jehu
did
not
take
care
to
walk
in
the
Law
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
with
all
his
heart
He
did
not
turn
away
from
the
sins
that
Jeroboam
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
32
In
those
days
Jehovah
started
to
cut
off
Israel
piece
by
piece
Hazael
kept
attacking
them
throughout
the
territory
of
Israel
33
from
the
Jordan
eastward
all
the
land
of
Gilead—of
the
Gadites
the
Reubenites
and
the
Manassites—from
Aroer
which
is
by
the
Arnon
Valley
to
Gilead
and
Bashan
34
And
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehu
all
that
he
did
and
all
his
mightiness
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
35
Then
Jehu
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
in
Samaria
and
his
son
Jehoahaz
became
king
in
his
place
36
The
length
of
Jehus
reign
over
Israel
was
28
years
in
Samaria
1
Now
when
Athaliah
Ahaziahs
mother
saw
that
her
son
had
died
she
rose
up
and
destroyed
the
entire
royal
line
2
However
Jehosheba
the
daughter
of
King
Jehoram
Ahaziahs
sister
took
Jehoash
the
son
of
Ahaziah
and
stole
him
away
from
among
the
sons
of
the
king
who
were
to
be
put
to
death
keeping
him
and
his
nurse
in
an
inner
bedroom
They
managed
to
keep
him
concealed
from
Athaliah
so
he
was
not
put
to
death
3
He
remained
with
her
for
six
years
hidden
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
while
Athaliah
was
ruling
over
the
land
4
In
the
seventh
year
Jehoiada
sent
for
the
chiefs
of
hundreds
of
the
Carian
bodyguard
and
of
the
palace
guards
and
had
them
come
to
him
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
He
made
a
pact
with
them
and
had
them
swear
to
it
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
then
he
showed
them
the
son
of
the
king
5
He
ordered
them
This
is
what
you
are
to
do
One
third
of
you
will
be
on
duty
on
the
Sabbath
and
will
keep
strict
watch
over
the
kings
house
6
another
third
will
be
at
the
Gate
of
the
Foundation
and
another
third
will
be
at
the
gate
behind
the
palace
guards
You
will
take
turns
watching
over
the
house
7
Your
two
divisions
that
are
supposed
to
be
off
duty
on
the
Sabbath
must
keep
strict
watch
over
the
house
of
Jehovah
to
protect
the
king
8
You
must
surround
the
king
on
every
side
each
with
his
weapons
in
hand
Anyone
entering
within
the
ranks
will
be
put
to
death
Stay
with
the
king
wherever
he
goes
9
The
chiefs
of
hundreds
did
exactly
what
Jehoiada
the
priest
had
commanded
So
each
one
took
his
men
who
were
on
duty
on
the
Sabbath
together
with
those
who
were
off
duty
on
the
Sabbath
and
they
came
in
to
Jehoiada
the
priest
10
The
priest
then
gave
the
chiefs
of
hundreds
the
spears
and
the
circular
shields
that
had
belonged
to
King
David
which
were
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
11
And
the
palace
guards
took
their
positions
each
with
his
weapons
in
hand
from
the
right
side
of
the
house
to
the
left
side
of
the
house
by
the
altar
and
by
the
house
all
around
the
king
12
Then
Jehoiada
brought
the
kings
son
out
and
put
on
him
the
crown
and
the
Testimony
and
they
made
him
king
and
anointed
him
They
began
to
clap
their
hands
and
say
Long
live
the
king
13
When
Athaliah
heard
the
sound
of
the
people
running
she
immediately
came
to
the
people
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
14
Then
she
saw
the
king
standing
there
by
the
pillar
according
to
the
custom
The
chiefs
and
the
trumpeters
were
with
the
king
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
were
rejoicing
and
blowing
the
trumpets
At
this
Athaliah
ripped
her
garments
apart
and
cried
out
Conspiracy
Conspiracy
15
But
Jehoiada
the
priest
commanded
the
chiefs
of
hundreds
those
appointed
over
the
army
and
said
to
them
Take
her
out
from
among
the
ranks
and
if
anyone
follows
her
put
him
to
death
with
the
sword
For
the
priest
had
said
Do
not
put
her
to
death
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
16
So
they
seized
her
and
when
she
reached
the
place
where
the
horses
enter
the
kings
house
she
was
put
to
death
there
17
Then
Jehoiada
made
a
covenant
between
Jehovah
and
the
king
and
the
people
that
they
would
continue
as
the
people
of
Jehovah
and
he
also
made
a
covenant
between
the
king
and
the
people
18
After
that
all
the
people
of
the
land
came
to
the
house
of
Baal
and
tore
down
his
altars
completely
smashed
his
images
and
killed
Mattan
the
priest
of
Baal
in
front
of
the
altars
Then
the
priest
appointed
overseers
over
the
house
of
Jehovah
19
Further
he
took
the
chiefs
of
hundreds
the
Carian
bodyguard
the
palace
guards
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
to
escort
the
king
down
from
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
they
came
to
the
kings
house
by
the
way
of
the
gate
of
the
palace
guard
He
then
sat
on
the
throne
of
the
kings
20
So
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
the
city
was
quiet
for
they
had
put
Athaliah
to
death
with
the
sword
at
the
kings
house
21
Jehoash
was
seven
years
old
when
he
became
king
1
In
the
seventh
year
of
Jehu
Jehoash
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
40
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Zibiah
from
Beer-sheba
2
Jehoash
continued
doing
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
all
the
days
that
Jehoiada
the
priest
instructed
him
3
However
the
high
places
were
not
removed
and
the
people
were
still
sacrificing
and
making
sacrificial
smoke
on
the
high
places
4
Jehoash
said
to
the
priests
Take
all
the
money
that
is
brought
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
for
the
holy
offerings
the
money
for
which
each
one
is
assessed
the
money
given
as
an
estimated
value
for
a
person
and
all
the
money
that
each
persons
heart
is
moved
to
bring
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
5
The
priests
will
personally
take
it
from
their
donors
and
use
it
to
repair
the
house
wherever
any
damage
is
found
6
By
the
23rd
year
of
King
Jehoash
the
priests
had
not
yet
repaired
the
damage
to
the
house
7
So
King
Jehoash
called
Jehoiada
the
priest
and
the
other
priests
and
said
to
them
Why
are
you
not
repairing
the
damage
to
the
house
Therefore
do
not
take
any
more
money
from
your
donors
unless
it
is
used
to
repair
the
house
8
At
that
the
priests
agreed
not
to
take
any
more
money
from
the
people
and
not
to
be
responsible
for
repairing
the
house
9
Jehoiada
the
priest
then
took
a
chest
and
bored
a
hole
in
its
lid
and
put
it
next
to
the
altar
on
the
right
as
one
enters
the
house
of
Jehovah
That
is
where
the
priests
who
served
as
doorkeepers
would
put
all
the
money
that
was
brought
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
10
Whenever
they
saw
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
money
in
the
chest
the
secretary
of
the
king
and
the
high
priest
would
come
up
and
collect
and
count
the
money
that
had
been
brought
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
11
They
would
give
the
money
that
had
been
counted
to
those
appointed
over
the
work
being
done
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
They
in
turn
paid
it
to
the
woodworkers
and
to
the
builders
who
were
working
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
12
as
well
as
to
the
masons
and
the
stonecutters
They
also
bought
timbers
and
hewn
stones
for
repairing
the
damage
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
used
the
money
for
all
the
other
expenses
incurred
in
repairing
the
house
13
However
none
of
the
money
brought
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
was
used
to
make
basins
of
silver
extinguishers
bowls
trumpets
or
any
sort
of
gold
or
silver
article
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
14
They
would
give
it
only
to
those
who
did
the
work
and
with
it
they
repaired
the
house
of
Jehovah
15
They
would
not
call
for
an
accounting
from
the
men
to
whom
they
gave
the
money
to
give
to
the
workers
for
they
were
trustworthy
16
However
the
money
for
guilt
offerings
and
the
money
for
sin
offerings
was
not
brought
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
it
belonged
to
the
priests
17
It
was
then
that
Hazael
the
king
of
Syria
went
up
to
fight
against
Gath
and
he
captured
it
after
which
he
decided
to
attack
Jerusalem
18
At
that
King
Jehoash
of
Judah
took
all
the
holy
offerings
that
his
forefathers
Jehoshaphat
Jehoram
and
Ahaziah
the
kings
of
Judah
had
sanctified
as
well
as
his
own
holy
offerings
and
all
the
gold
to
be
found
in
the
treasuries
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
kings
house
and
sent
them
to
Hazael
the
king
of
Syria
So
he
withdrew
from
Jerusalem
19
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehoash
all
that
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
20
However
his
servants
joined
in
a
conspiracy
against
him
and
struck
Jehoash
down
at
the
house
of
the
Mound
on
the
way
that
goes
down
to
Silla
21
His
servants
Jozacar
the
son
of
Shimeath
and
Jehozabad
the
son
of
Shomer
were
the
ones
who
struck
him
and
put
him
to
death
They
buried
him
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
and
his
son
Amaziah
became
king
in
his
place
1
In
the
23rd
year
of
Jehoash
the
son
of
Ahaziah
the
king
of
Judah
Jehoahaz
the
son
of
Jehu
became
king
over
Israel
in
Samaria
and
he
reigned
for
17
years
2
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
and
he
persisted
in
the
sin
that
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
He
did
not
turn
away
from
it
3
So
Jehovahs
anger
grew
hot
against
Israel
and
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
King
Hazael
of
Syria
and
into
the
hand
of
Ben-hadad
the
son
of
Hazael
all
their
days
4
In
time
Jehoahaz
begged
for
the
favor
of
Jehovah
and
Jehovah
listened
to
him
for
he
had
seen
the
oppression
the
king
of
Syria
had
inflicted
on
Israel
5
So
Jehovah
provided
Israel
with
a
savior
to
free
them
from
Syrias
grip
and
the
Israelites
were
able
to
dwell
in
their
homes
as
before
6
However
they
did
not
depart
from
the
sin
of
the
house
of
Jeroboam
that
he
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
They
continued
in
this
sin
and
the
sacred
pole
continued
to
stand
in
Samaria
7
Jehoahaz
was
left
with
an
army
of
only
50
horsemen
10
chariots
and
10000
foot
soldiers
because
the
king
of
Syria
had
destroyed
them
trampling
them
like
the
dust
at
threshing
time
8
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehoahaz
all
that
he
did
and
his
mightiness
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
9
Then
Jehoahaz
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
in
Samaria
and
his
son
Jehoash
became
king
in
his
place
10
In
the
37th
year
of
King
Jehoash
of
Judah
Jehoash
the
son
of
Jehoahaz
became
king
over
Israel
in
Samaria
and
he
reigned
for
16
years
11
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
not
departing
from
all
the
sins
that
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
had
made
Israel
commit
He
continued
in
these
sins
12
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehoash
all
that
he
did
and
his
mightiness
and
how
he
fought
against
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
13
Then
Jehoash
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
Jeroboam
sat
on
his
throne
And
Jehoash
was
buried
in
Samaria
with
the
kings
of
Israel
14
Now
when
Elisha
became
ill
with
the
sickness
from
which
he
eventually
died
Jehoash
the
king
of
Israel
came
down
to
him
and
wept
over
him
saying
My
father
my
father
The
chariot
of
Israel
and
his
horsemen
15
Elisha
then
said
to
him
Take
a
bow
and
arrows
So
he
took
a
bow
and
arrows
16
Then
he
said
to
the
king
of
Israel
Put
your
hand
to
the
bow
So
he
put
his
hand
to
it
after
which
Elisha
laid
his
hands
on
the
kings
hands
17
Then
he
said
Open
the
window
toward
the
east
So
he
opened
it
Elisha
said
Shoot
So
he
shot
He
now
said
Jehovahs
arrow
of
victory
the
arrow
of
victory
over
Syria
You
will
strike
down
Syria
at
Aphek
until
you
finish
it
off
18
He
continued
Take
the
arrows

and
he
took
them
Then
he
said
to
the
king
of
Israel
Strike
the
ground
So
he
struck
the
ground
three
times
and
stopped
19
At
that
the
man
of
the
true
God
grew
indignant
at
him
and
said
You
should
have
struck
the
ground
five
or
six
times
Then
you
would
have
struck
down
Syria
until
you
finished
it
off
but
now
you
will
strike
down
Syria
only
three
times
20
After
that
Elisha
died
and
was
buried
There
were
Moabite
marauder
bands
that
would
come
into
the
land
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
21
As
some
men
were
burying
a
man
they
saw
the
marauder
band
so
they
quickly
threw
the
man
into
Elishas
burial
place
and
ran
off
When
the
man
touched
the
bones
of
Elisha
he
came
to
life
and
stood
on
his
feet
22
Now
King
Hazael
of
Syria
oppressed
Israel
all
the
days
of
Jehoahaz
23
However
Jehovah
extended
favor
and
mercy
to
them
and
showed
his
concern
for
them
for
the
sake
of
his
covenant
with
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
He
did
not
want
to
bring
them
to
ruin
and
he
has
not
cast
them
away
from
his
presence
to
this
day
24
When
King
Hazael
of
Syria
died
his
son
Ben-hadad
became
king
in
his
place
25
Jehoash
the
son
of
Jehoahaz
then
took
back
from
Ben-hadad
the
son
of
Hazael
the
cities
that
he
had
taken
in
war
from
Jehoahaz
his
father
Three
times
Jehoash
struck
him
down
and
he
recovered
the
cities
of
Israel
1
In
the
second
year
of
Jehoash
the
son
of
Jehoahaz
the
king
of
Israel
Amaziah
the
son
of
King
Jehoash
of
Judah
became
king
2
He
was
25
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
29
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Jehoaddin
of
Jerusalem
3
He
continued
to
do
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
but
not
like
David
his
forefather
He
did
everything
as
Jehoash
his
father
had
done
4
However
the
high
places
were
not
removed
and
the
people
were
still
sacrificing
and
making
sacrificial
smoke
on
the
high
places
5
As
soon
as
he
had
the
kingdom
firmly
in
his
control
he
struck
down
his
servants
who
had
struck
down
his
father
the
king
6
But
he
did
not
put
the
sons
of
the
murderers
to
death
in
harmony
with
Jehovahs
commandment
written
in
the
book
of
Moses
Law
Fathers
should
not
be
put
to
death
for
their
sons
and
sons
should
not
be
put
to
death
for
their
fathers
but
each
one
should
be
put
to
death
for
his
own
sin
7
He
struck
down
the
Edomites
in
the
Valley
of
Salt
10000
men
and
captured
Sela
in
the
war
and
its
name
became
Joktheel
to
this
day
8
Then
Amaziah
sent
messengers
to
Jehoash
son
of
Jehoahaz
son
of
Jehu
the
king
of
Israel
saying
Come
let
us
confront
each
other
in
battle
9
King
Jehoash
of
Israel
sent
this
message
to
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
The
thorny
weed
in
Lebanon
sent
a
message
to
the
cedar
in
Lebanon
Give
your
daughter
to
my
son
as
a
wife
However
a
wild
beast
of
Lebanon
passed
by
and
trampled
down
the
thorny
weed
10
True
you
have
struck
down
Edom
so
your
heart
has
become
arrogant
Enjoy
your
glory
but
stay
in
your
own
house
Why
should
you
provoke
disaster
and
fall
bringing
Judah
down
with
you
11
But
Amaziah
did
not
listen
So
King
Jehoash
of
Israel
went
up
and
he
and
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
confronted
each
other
in
battle
at
Beth-shemesh
which
belongs
to
Judah
12
Judah
was
defeated
by
Israel
so
each
one
fled
to
his
home
13
King
Jehoash
of
Israel
captured
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
son
of
Jehoash
son
of
Ahaziah
at
Beth-shemesh
Then
they
came
to
Jerusalem
and
he
made
a
breach
in
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
from
the
Gate
of
Ephraim
to
the
Corner
Gate
400
cubits
14
He
took
all
the
gold
and
the
silver
and
all
the
articles
that
were
found
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
in
the
treasuries
of
the
house
of
the
king
as
well
as
hostages
Then
he
returned
to
Samaria
15
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehoash
what
he
did
and
his
mightiness
and
how
he
fought
against
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
16
Then
Jehoash
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
in
Samaria
with
the
kings
of
Israel
and
his
son
Jeroboam
became
king
in
his
place
17
Amaziah
the
son
of
Jehoash
the
king
of
Judah
lived
for
15
years
after
the
death
of
Jehoash
the
son
of
Jehoahaz
the
king
of
Israel
18
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Amaziah
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
19
Later
a
conspiracy
was
formed
against
him
at
Jerusalem
and
he
fled
to
Lachish
but
they
sent
men
after
him
to
Lachish
and
put
him
to
death
there
20
So
they
carried
him
back
on
horses
and
he
was
buried
in
Jerusalem
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
21
Then
all
the
people
of
Judah
took
Azariah
who
was
16
years
old
and
made
him
king
in
place
of
his
father
Amaziah
22
He
rebuilt
Elath
and
restored
it
to
Judah
after
the
king
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
23
In
the
15th
year
of
Amaziah
the
son
of
Jehoash
the
king
of
Judah
Jeroboam
the
son
of
King
Jehoash
of
Israel
became
king
in
Samaria
and
he
reigned
for
41
years
24
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
He
did
not
depart
from
all
the
sins
that
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
25
He
restored
the
boundary
of
Israel
from
Lebo-hamath
clear
to
the
Sea
of
the
Arabah
according
to
the
word
that
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
spoke
through
his
servant
Jonah
the
son
of
Amittai
the
prophet
from
Gath-hepher
26
For
Jehovah
had
seen
the
very
bitter
affliction
of
Israel
There
was
no
one
left
to
help
Israel
not
even
the
helpless
or
the
weak
27
But
Jehovah
had
promised
not
to
wipe
out
the
name
of
Israel
from
under
the
heavens
So
he
saved
them
by
the
hand
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Jehoash
28
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jeroboam
all
that
he
did
and
his
mightiness
how
he
fought
and
how
he
restored
Damascus
and
Hamath
to
Judah
in
Israel
is
it
not
written
in

of
the
history
of

29
Then
Jeroboam
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
with
the
kings
of
Israel
and
his
son
Zechariah
became
king
in
his
place
1
In
the
27th
year
of
King
Jeroboam
of
Israel
Azariah
the
son
of
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
became
king
2
He
was
16
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
52
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Jecoliah
of
Jerusalem
3
He
continued
to
do
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
just
as
his
father
Amaziah
had
done
4
However
the
high
places
were
not

and
the
people
were
still
sacrificing
and
making

on
the

places
5
Jehovah
afflicted
the
king
and
he
remained
a
leper
until
the
day
of
his
death
and
he
stayed
in
a
separate
house
while
the
kings
son
Jotham
was
in
charge
of
the
house
judging
the
people
of
the
land
6
As
for
the
rest
of

of
Azariah
all
that
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
7
Then
Azariah
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
and
his
son
Jotham
became
king
in
his
place
8
In
the
38th
year
of
King
Azariah
of
Judah
Zechariah
the
son
of
Jeroboam
became
king
over
Israel
in
Samaria
and
he
reigned
for
six
months
9
He
did
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
just
as
his
forefathers
had
done
He
did
not
depart
from
the
sins
that
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
had
caused
Israel
to
commit
10
Then
Shallum
the
son
of
Jabesh
conspired
against
him
and
struck
him
down
at
Ibleam
After
putting
him
to
death
he
became
king
in
his
place
11
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Zechariah
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
12
That
fulfilled
Jehovahs
word
spoken
to
Jehu
Four
generations
of
your
sons
will
sit
on
the
throne
of
Israel
And
that
is
how
it
happened
13
Shallum
the
son
of
Jabesh
became
king
in
the
39th
year
of
King
Uzziah
of
Judah
and
he
reigned
for
a
full
month
in
Samaria
14
Then
Menahem
the
son
of
Gadi
came
up
from
Tirzah
to
Samaria
and
struck
down
Shallum
the
son
of
Jabesh
in
Samaria
After
putting
him
to
death
he
became
king
in
his
place
15
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Shallum
and
the
conspiracy
that
he
formed
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Israel
16
It
was
then
that
Menahem
came
from
Tirzah
and
struck
down
Tiphsah
and
all
who
were
in
it
and
its
territory
because
it
did
not
open
its
gates
to
him
He
struck
it
down
and
ripped
open
its
pregnant
women
17
In
the
39th
year
of
King
Azariah
of
Judah
Menahem
the
son
of
Gadi
became
king
over
Israel
and
he
reigned
for
ten
years
in
Samaria
18
He
continued
to

He

that
Jeroboam
the

Israel
to
commit
all
his
days
19
King
Pul
of
Assyria
came
into
the
land
and
Menahem
gave
Pul
1000
talents
of
silver
in
return
for
his
support
in
strengthening
his
hold
on
the
kingdom
20
So
Menahem
raised
the
silver
from
Israel
by
exacting
it
from
the
prominent
wealthy
men
He
gave
the
king
of
Assyria
50
silver
shekels
for
each
man
Then
the
king
of
Assyria
turned
back
and
did
not
stay
in
the
land
21
As
for
the

of
the

Menahem

he
did
is

22
Then

and
his

Pekahiah
became

23
In

25
Then
his
adjutant
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
conspired
against
him
and
struck
him
down
in
Samaria
in
the
fortified
tower
of
the
kings
house
with
Argob
and
Arieh
He
had
50
men
of
Gilead
with
him
and
after
he
put
him
to
death
he
became

captured
Ijon
Abel-beth-maacah
Janoah
Kedesh
Hazor
Gilead
and
Galilee
all
the
land
of
Naphtali
and
he
took
the
inhabitants
into
exile
in
Assyria
30
Then
Hoshea
the
son
of
Elah
formed
a
conspiracy
against
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
and
he
struck
him
and
put
him
to
death
and
he
became
king
in

in

20th
year
of
Jotham
the

33
He

and
he
reigned
for
16
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Jerusha
the
daughter
of
Zadok
34
He
kept
doing
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
just
as
his
father
Uzziah
had
done
35
However
the
high
places
were
not
removed
and
the
people
were
still
sacrificing
and
making
sacrificial
smoke
on
the
high
places
He
was
the
one
who
built
the
upper
gate
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
36
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history

Jotham
what
he
did
is

not

of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
37
In
those
days
Jehovah
began
sending
Rezin
the
king
of
Syria
and
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
against
Judah
38
Then
Jotham
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
his
forefather
And
his
son
Ahaz
became
king
in
his
place
1
In
the
17th
year
of
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
Ahaz
the
son
of
King
Jotham
of
Judah
became
king
2
Ahaz
was
20
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
16
years
in
Jerusalem
He
did
not
do
what
was
right
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
his
God
as
David
his
forefather
had
done
3
Instead
he
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
Israel
and
he
even
made
his
own
son
pass
through
the
fire
following
the
detestable
practices
of
the
nations
that
Jehovah
had
driven
out
from
before
the
Israelites
4
He
also
kept
sacrificing
and
making
sacrificial
smoke
on
the
high
places
on
the
hills
and
under
every
luxuriant
tree
5
It
was
then
that
King
Rezin
of
Syria
and
Pekah
son
of
Remaliah
the
king
of
Israel
came
up
to
wage
war
against
Jerusalem
They
laid
siege
against
Ahaz
but
were
not
able
to
capture
the
city
6
At
that
time
King
Rezin
of
Syria
restored
Elath
to
Edom
after
which
he
drove
the
Jews
out
of
Elath
And
the
Edomites
entered
Elath
and
they
have
occupied
it
down
to
this
day
7
So
Ahaz
sent
messengers
to
King
Tiglath-pileser
of
Assyria
saying
I
am
your
servant
and
your
son
Come
up
and
save
me
from
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Syria
and
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Israel
who
are
attacking
me
8
Ahaz
then
took
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
was
to
be
found
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
in
the
treasuries
of
the
kings
house
and
sent
the
king
of
Assyria
a
bribe
9
The
king
of
Assyria
responded
to
his
request
and
he
went
up
to
Damascus
and
captured
it
and
led
its
people
into
exile
to
Kir
and
he
put
Rezin
to
death
10
Then
King
Ahaz
went
to
meet
King
Tiglath-pileser
of
Assyria
at
Damascus
When
he
saw
the
altar
that
was
in
Damascus
King
Ahaz
sent
Urijah
the
priest
a
plan
of
the
altar
showing
its
pattern
and
how
it
was
made
11
Urijah
the
priest
built
an
altar
according
to
all
the
directions
that
King
Ahaz
had
sent
from
Damascus
Urijah
the
priest
finished
building
it
before
King
Ahaz
returned
from
Damascus
12
When
the
king
returned
from
Damascus
and
saw
the
altar
he
approached
the
altar
and
made
offerings
on
it
13
And
on
that
altar
he
continued
to
make
his
burnt
offerings
and
his
grain
offerings
smoke
he
also
poured
out
his
drink
offerings
and
sprinkled
the
blood
of
his
communion
sacrifices
on
it
14
Then
he
moved
the
copper
altar
that
was
before
Jehovah
from
its
place
in
front
of
the
house
from
between
his
own
altar
and
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
he
put
it
at
the
north
side
of
his
own
altar
15
King
Ahaz
commanded
Urijah
the
priest
Make
the
morning
burnt
offering
smoke
on
the
great
altar
also
the
evening
grain
offering
the
kings
burnt
offering
and
his
grain
offering
as
well
as
the
burnt
offerings
the
grain
offerings
and
the
drink
offerings
of
all
the
people
You
should
also
sprinkle
on
it
all
the
blood
of
the
burnt
offerings
and
all
the
blood
of
the
other
sacrifices
As
for
the
copper
altar
let
me
decide
what
to
do
with
it
16
And
Urijah
the
priest
did
everything
that
King
Ahaz
had
commanded
17
Furthermore
King
Ahaz
cut
the
side
panels
of
the
carriages
into
pieces
and
removed
the
basins
from
them
and
he
took
the
Sea
down
off
the
copper
bulls
that
supported
it
and
put
it
on
a
stone
pavement
18
And
the
covered
structure
for
the
Sabbath
that
had
been
built
in
the
house
and
the
kings
outer
entryway
he
shifted
away
from
the
house
of
Jehovah
he
did
so
because
of
the
king
of
Assyria
19
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Ahaz
what
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
20
Then
Ahaz
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
and
his
son
Hezekiah
became
king
in
his
place
1
In
the
12th
year
of
King
Ahaz
of
Judah
Hoshea
the
son
of
Elah
became
king
over
Israel
in
Samaria
he
ruled
for
nine
years
2
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
only
not
to
the
extent
of
the
kings
of
Israel
prior
to
him
3
King
Shalmaneser
of
Assyria
came
up
against
him
and
Hoshea
became
his
servant
and
began
to
pay
tribute
to
him
4
However
the
king
of
Assyria
learned
that
Hoshea
was
involved
in
a
conspiracy
for
he
had
sent
messengers
to
King
So
of
Egypt
and
did
not
bring
the
tribute
up
to
the
king
of
Assyria
as
in
former
years
Therefore
the
king
of
Assyria
kept
him
confined
and
bound
in
prison
5
The
king
of
Assyria
invaded
the
entire
land
and
he
came
to
Samaria
and
laid
siege
to
it
for
three
years
6
In
the
ninth
year
of
Hoshea
the
king
of
Assyria
captured
Samaria
He
then
led
the
people
of
Israel
into
exile
in
Assyria
and
made
them
dwell
in
Halah
and
in
Habor
at
the
river
Gozan
and
in
the
cities
of
the
Medes
7
This
happened
because
the
people
of
Israel
had
sinned
against
Jehovah
their
God
who
brought
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
from
under
the
control
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
They
worshipped
other
gods
8
they
followed
the
customs
of
the
nations
that
Jehovah
had
driven
out
from
before
the
Israelites
and
they
followed
the
customs
that
the
kings
of
Israel
had
established

9
The
Israelites
were
pursuing
the
things
that
were
not
right
according
to
Jehovah
their
God
They
kept
building
high
places
in
all
their
cities
from
watchtower
to
fortified
city
10
They
kept
setting
up
for
themselves
sacred
pillars
and
sacred
poles
on
every
high
hill
and
under
every
luxuriant
tree
11
and
on
all
the
high
places
they
would
make
sacrificial
smoke
just
as
the
nations
did
that
Jehovah
had
driven
into
exile
from
before
them
They
kept
doing
wicked
things
to
offend
Jehovah
12
They
continued
to
serve
disgusting
idols
about
which
Jehovah
had
told
them
You
must
not
do
this
13
Jehovah
kept
warning
Israel
and
Judah
through
all
his
prophets
and
every
visionary
saying
Turn
back
from
your
wicked
ways
Keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
according
to
all
the
law
that
I
commanded
your
forefathers
and
that
I
sent
to
you
through
my
servants
the
prophets
14
But
they
did
not
listen
and
they
remained
just
as
stubborn
as
their
forefathers
who
had
not
shown
faith
in
Jehovah
their
God
15
They
continued
rejecting
his
regulations
and
his
covenant
that
he
had
made
with
their
forefathers
and
his
reminders
that
he
had
given
to
warn
them
and
they
kept
following
worthless
idols
and
became
worthless
themselves
imitating
the
nations
all
around
them
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
them
not
to
imitate
16
They
kept
leaving
all
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
their
God
and
they
made
metal
statues
of
two
calves
and
a
sacred
pole
and
they
bowed
down
to
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
and
served
Baal
17
They
also
made
their
sons
and
their
daughters
pass
through
the
fire
they
practiced
divination
and
looked
for
omens
and
they
kept
devoting
themselves
to
do
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
to
offend
him
18
So
Jehovah
was
very
angry
with
Israel
so
that
he
removed
them
from
his
sight
He
did
not
let
any
remain
but
the
tribe
of
Judah
alone
19
Even
Judah
did
not
keep
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
their
God
they
also
walked
in
the
customs
that
Israel
followed
20
Jehovah
rejected
all
the
descendants
of
Israel
and
humiliated
them
and
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
plunderers
until
he
had
cast
them
away
from
before
him
21
He
ripped
Israel
away
from
the
house
of
David
and
they
made
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
king
But
Jeroboam
caused
Israel
to
stray
from
following
Jehovah
and
he
caused
them
to
commit
a
great
sin
22
And
the
people
of
Israel
kept
walking
in
all
the
sins
that
Jeroboam
had
committed
They
did
not
depart
from
them
23
until
Jehovah
removed
Israel
from
his
sight
just
as
he
had
declared
through
all
his
servants
the
prophets
So
Israel
was
taken
into
exile
from
its
land
to
Assyria
where
they
remain
to
this
day
24
The
king
of
Assyria
then
brought
people
from
Babylon
Cuthah
Avva
Hamath
and
Sepharvaim
and
settled
them
in
the
cities
of
Samaria
in
place
of
the
Israelites
they
took
possession
of
Samaria
and
lived
in
its
cities
25
When
they
first
began
dwelling
there
they
did
not
fear
Jehovah
So
Jehovah
sent
lions
among
them
and
they
killed
some
of
the
people
26
It
was
reported
to
the
king
of
Assyria
The
nations
that
you
have
taken
into
exile
and
resettled
in
the
cities
of
Samaria
do
not
know
the
religion
of
the
God
of
the
land
So
he
keeps
sending
lions
among
them
which
are
putting
them
to
death
because
none
of
them
know
the
religion
of
the
God
of
the
land
27
At
that
the
king
of
Assyria
commanded
Have
one
of
the
priests
whom
you
took
into
exile
from
there
return
to
live
there
and
to
teach
them
the
religion
of
the
God
of
the
land
28
So
one
of
the
priests
whom
they
had
taken
into
exile
from
Samaria
came
back
to
live
in
Bethel
and
he
began
to
teach
them
how
they
should
fear
Jehovah
29
However
each
different
nation
made
their
own
god
which
they
placed
in
the
houses
of
worship
on
the
high
places
that
the
Samaritans
had
made
each
different
nation
did
so
in
their
cities
where
they
were
living
30
So
the
men
of
Babylon
made
Succoth-benoth
the
men
of
Cuth
made
Nergal
the
men
of
Hamath
made
Ashima
31
and
the
Avvites
made
Nibhaz
and
Tartak
The
Sepharvites
would
burn
their
sons
in
the
fire
to
Adrammelech
and
Anammelech
the
gods
of
Sepharvaim
32
Although
they
feared
Jehovah
they
appointed
priests
for
the
high
places
from
the
people
in
general
and
these
officiated
for
them
at
the
houses
of
worship
on
the
high
places
33
Thus
they
feared
Jehovah
but
they
worshipped
their
own
gods
according
to
the
religion
of
the
nations
from
which
they
had
been
deported
34
To
this
day
they
follow
their
former
religions
None
of
them
worship
Jehovah
and
none
follow
his
statutes
his
judgments
the
Law
and
the
commandment
that
Jehovah
gave
the
sons
of
Jacob
whose
name
he
changed
to
Israel
35
When
Jehovah
made
a
covenant
with
them
he
commanded
them
You
must
not
fear
other
gods
and
you
must
not
bow
down
to
them
or
serve
them
or
sacrifice
to
them
36
But
Jehovah
who
brought
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
great
power
and
an
outstretched
arm
is
the
One
you
should
fear
and
to
him
you
should
bow
down
and
to
him
you
should
sacrifice
37
And
the
regulations
the
judgments
the
Law
and
the
commandment
that
he
wrote
for
you
you
should
always
follow
carefully
and
you
must
not
fear
other
gods
38
And
you
must
not
forget
the
covenant
that
I
made
with
you
and
you
must
not
fear
other
gods
39
But
it
is
Jehovah
your
God
whom
you
should
fear
as
he
is
the
one
who
will
rescue
you
out
of
the
hand
of
all
your
enemies
40
But
they
did
not
obey
and
they
followed
their
former
religion
41
So
these
nations
came
to
fear
Jehovah
but
they
were
also
serving
their
own
graven
images
Both
their
sons
and
their
grandsons
have
done
just
as
their
forefathers
did
down
to
this
day
1
In
the
third
year
of
Hoshea
the
son
of
Elah
the
king
of
Israel
Hezekiah
the
son
of
King
Ahaz
of
Judah
became
king
2
He
was
25
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
29
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Abi
the
daughter
of
Zechariah
3
He
kept
doing
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
just
as
David
his
forefather
had
done
4
He
was
the
one
who
removed
the
high
places
smashed
the
sacred
pillars
and
cut
down
the
sacred
pole
He
also
crushed
the
copper
serpent
that
Moses
had
made
for
down
to
that
time
the
people
of
Israel
had
been
making
sacrificial
smoke
to
it
and
it
used
to
be
called
the
copper
serpent-idol
5
He
trusted
in
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
there
was
no
one
like
him
among
all
the
kings
of
Judah
after
him
nor
among
those
prior
to
him
6
He
held
fast
to
Jehovah
He
did
not
turn
away
from
following
him
he
continued
to
keep
the
commandments
that
Jehovah
had
given
to
Moses
7
And
Jehovah
was
with
him
Wherever
he
went
he
acted
wisely
He
rebelled
against
the
king
of
Assyria
and
refused
to
serve
him
8
He
also
defeated
the
Philistines
clear
to
Gaza
and
its
territories
from
watchtower
to
fortified
city
9
In
the
fourth
year
of
King
Hezekiah
that
is
the
seventh
year
of
Hoshea
the
son
of
Elah
the
king
of
Israel
King
Shalmaneser
of
Assyria
came
up
against
Samaria
and
began
to
lay
siege
to
it
10
They
captured
it
at
the
end
of
three
years
in
the
sixth
year
of
Hezekiah
which
was
the
ninth
year
of
King
Hoshea
of
Israel
Samaria
was
captured
11
Then
the
king
of
Assyria
took
Israel
into
exile
in
Assyria
and
settled
them
in
Halah
and
in
Habor
at
the
river
Gozan
and
in
the
cities
of
the
Medes
12
This
was
because
they
had
not
listened
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
their
God
but
kept
violating
his
covenant
all
that
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
had
commanded
They
neither
listened
nor
obeyed
13
In
the
14th
year
of
King
Hezekiah
Sennacherib
the
king
of
Assyria
came
up
against
all
the
fortified
cities
of
Judah
and
captured
them
14
So
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
sent
word
to
the
king
of
Assyria
at
Lachish
I
am
at
fault
Withdraw
from
against
me
and
I
will
give
whatever
you
may
impose
on
me
The
king
of
Assyria
imposed
on
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
a
fine
of
300
silver
talents
and
30
gold
talents
15
So
Hezekiah
gave
all
the
silver
that
could
be
found
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
in
the
treasuries
of
the
kings
house
16
At
that
time
Hezekiah
removed
the
doors
of
the
temple
of
Jehovah
and
the
doorposts
that
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
himself
had
overlaid
and
he
gave
them
to
the
king
of
Assyria
17
The
king
of
Assyria
then
sent
the
Tartan
the
Rabsaris
and
the
Rabshakeh
with
a
vast
army
from
Lachish
to
King
Hezekiah
in
Jerusalem
They
went
up
to
Jerusalem
and
took
up
a
position
by
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
which
is
at
the
highway
of
the
laundrymans
field
18
When
they
called
for
the
king
to
come
out
Eliakim
son
of
Hilkiah
who
was
in
charge
of
the
household
Shebnah
the
secretary
and
Joah
son
of
Asaph
the
recorder
came
out
to
them
19
So
the
Rabshakeh
said
to
them
Please
say
to
Hezekiah
This
is
what
the
great
king
the
king
of
Assyria
says
What
is
the
basis
for
your
confidence
20
You
are
saying
I
have
a
strategy
and
the
power
to
wage
war

but
these
are
empty
words
In
whom
have
you
put
your
trust
so
that
you
dare
to
rebel
against
me
21
Look
You
trust
in
the
support
of
this
crushed
reed
Egypt
which
if
a
man
should
lean
on
it
would
enter
into
his
palm
and
pierce
it
That
is
the
way
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
is
to
all
those
who
trust
in
him
22
And
if
you
should
say
to
me
We
trust
in
Jehovah
our
God

is
he
not
the
one
whose
high
places
and
altars
Hezekiah
has
removed
while
he
says
to
Judah
and
Jerusalem
You
should
bow
down
before
this
altar
in
Jerusalem
23
So
now
make
this
wager
please
with
my
lord
the
king
of
Assyria
I
will
give
you
2000
horses
if
you
are
able
to
find
enough
riders
for
them
24
How
then
could
you
drive
back
even
one
governor
who
is
the
least
of
my
lords
servants
while
you
put
your
trust
in
Egypt
for
chariots
and
for
horsemen
25
Now
is
it
without
authorization
from
Jehovah
that
I
have
come
up
against
this
place
to
destroy
it
Jehovah
himself
said
to
me
Go
up
against
this
land
and
destroy
it
26
At
this
Eliakim
son
of
Hilkiah
and
Shebnah
and
Joah
said
to
the
Rabshakeh
Speak
to
your
servants
please
in
the
Aramaic
language
for
we
can
understand
it
do
not
speak
to
us
in
the
language
of
the
Jews
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
on
the
wall
27
But
the
Rabshakeh
said
to
them
Is
it
just
to
your
lord
and
to
you
that
my
lord
sent
me
to
speak
these
words
Is
it
not
also
to
the
men
who
sit
on
the
wall
those
who
will
eat
their
own
excrement
and
drink
their
own
urine
along
with
you
28
Then
the
Rabshakeh
stood
and
called
out
loudly
in
the
language
of
the
Jews
saying
Hear
the
word
of
the
great
king
the
king
of
Assyria
29
This
is
what
the
king
says
Do
not
let
Hezekiah
deceive
you
for
he
is
not
able
to
rescue
you
out
of
my
hand
30
And
do
not
let
Hezekiah
cause
you
to
trust
in
Jehovah
by
saying
Jehovah
will
surely
rescue
us
and
this
city
will
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria
31
Do
not
listen
to
Hezekiah
for
this
is
what
the
king
of
Assyria
says
Make
peace
with
me
and
surrender
and
each
of
you
will
eat
from
his
own
vine
and
from
his
own
fig
tree
and
will
drink
the
water
of
his
own
cistern
32
until
I
come
and
take
you
to
a
land
like
your
own
land
a
land
of
grain
and
new
wine
a
land
of
bread
and
vineyards
a
land
of
olive
trees
and
honey
Then
you
will
live
and
not
die
Do
not
listen
to
Hezekiah
for
he
misleads
you
by
saying
Jehovah
will
rescue
us
33
Have
any
of
the
gods
of
the
nations
rescued
their
land
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria
34
Where
are
the
gods
of
Hamath
and
Arpad
Where
are
the
gods
of
Sepharvaim
Hena
and
Ivvah
Have
they
rescued
Samaria
out
of
my
hand
35
Who
among
all
the
gods
of
the
lands
have
rescued
their
land
out
of
my
hand
so
that
Jehovah
should
rescue
Jerusalem
out
of
my
hand
36
But
the
people
kept
silent
and
did
not
say
a
word
to
him
in
reply
for
the
order
of
the
king
was
You
must
not
answer
him
37
But
Eliakim
son
of
Hilkiah
who
was
in
charge
of
the
household
Shebnah
the
secretary
and
Joah
son
of
Asaph
the
recorder
came
to
Hezekiah
with
their
garments
ripped
apart
and
told
him
the
words
of
the
Rabshakeh
1
As
soon
as
King
Hezekiah
heard
this
he
ripped
his
garments
apart
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth
and
went
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
2
Then
he
sent
Eliakim
who
was
in
charge
of
the
household
Shebnah
the
secretary
and
the
elders
of
the
priests
covered
with
sackcloth
to
the
prophet
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
3
They
said
to
him
This
is
what
Hezekiah
says
This
day
is
a
day
of
distress
of
rebuke
and
of
disgrace
for
the
children
are
ready
to
be
born
but
there
is
no
strength
to
give
birth
4
Perhaps
Jehovah
your
God
will
hear
all
the
words
of
the
Rabshakeh
whom
the
king
of
Assyria
his
lord
sent
to
taunt
the
living
God
and
he
will
call
him
to
account
for
the
words
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
heard
So
offer
up
a
prayer
in
behalf
of
the
remnant
who
have
survived
5
So
the
servants
of
King
Hezekiah
went
in
to
Isaiah
6
and
Isaiah
said
to
them
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
your
lord
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Do
not
be
afraid
because
of
the
words
that
you
heard
the
words
with
which
the
attendants
of
the
king
of
Assyria
blasphemed
me
7
Here
I
am
putting
a
thought
in
his
mind
and
he
will
hear
a
report
and
return
to
his
own
land
and
I
will
make
him
fall
by
the
sword
in
his
own
land
8
After
the
Rabshakeh
heard
that
the
king
of
Assyria
had
pulled
away
from
Lachish
he
returned
to
him
and
found
him
fighting
against
Libnah
9
Now
the
king
heard
it
said
about
King
Tirhakah
of
Ethiopia
Here
he
has
come
out
to
fight
against
you
So
he
sent
messengers
again
to
Hezekiah
saying
10
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
Do
not
let
your
God
in
whom
you
trust
deceive
you
by
saying
Jerusalem
will
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria
11
Look
You
have
heard
what
the
kings
of
Assyria
did
to
all
the
lands
by
devoting
them
to
destruction
Will
you
alone
be
rescued
12
Did
the
gods
of
the
nations
that
my
forefathers
destroyed
rescue
them
Where
are
Gozan
Haran
Rezeph
and
the
people
of
Eden
who
were
in
Tel-assar
13
Where
is
the
king
of
Hamath
the
king
of
Arpad
and
the
king
of
the
cities
of
Sepharvaim
and
of
Hena
and
of
Ivvah
14
Hezekiah
took
the
letters
out
of
the
hand
of
the
messengers
and
read
them
Hezekiah
then
went
up
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
spread
them
out
before
Jehovah
15
And
Hezekiah
began
to
pray
before
Jehovah
and
say
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
sitting
enthroned
above
the
cherubs
you
alone
are
the
true
God
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
You
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
16
Incline
your
ear
O
Jehovah
and
hear
Open
your
eyes
O
Jehovah
and
see
Hear
the
words
that
Sennacherib
has
sent
to
taunt
the
living
God
17
It
is
a
fact
O
Jehovah
that
the
kings
of
Assyria
have
devastated
the
nations
and
their
lands
18
And
they
have
thrown
their
gods
into
the
fire
because
they
were
not
gods
but
the
work
of
human
hands
wood
and
stone
That
is
why
they
could
destroy
them
19
But
now
O
Jehovah
our
God
please
save
us
out
of
his
hand
so
that
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
may
know
that
you
alone
are
God
O
Jehovah
20
Isaiah
son
of
Amoz
then
sent
this
message
to
Hezekiah
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
I
have
heard
your
prayer
to
me
concerning
King
Sennacherib
of
Assyria
21
This
is
the
word
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
against
him
The
virgin
daughter
of
Zion
despises
you
she
scoffs
at
you
The
daughter
of
Jerusalem
shakes
her
head
at
you
22
Whom
have
you
taunted
and
blasphemed
Against
whom
have
you
raised
your
voiceAnd
lifted
your
arrogant
eyes
It
is
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
23
Through
your
messengers
you
have
taunted
Jehovah
and
said
With
the
multitude
of
my
war
chariotsI
will
ascend
the
heights
of
mountains
The
remotest
parts
of
Lebanon
I
will
cut
down
its
lofty
cedars
its
choice
juniper
trees
I
will
enter
its
farthest
retreats
its
densest
forests
24
I
will
dig
wells
and
drink
foreign
waters
I
will
dry
up
all
the
streams
of
Egypt
with
the
soles
of
my
feet
25
Have
you
not
heard
From
long
ago
it
was
determined
From
days
gone
by
I
have
prepared
it
Now
I
will
bring
it
about
You
will
turn
fortified
cities
into
desolate
piles
of
ruins
26
Their
inhabitants
will
be
helpless
They
will
be
terrified
and
put
to
shame
They
will
become
as
vegetation
of
the
field
and
green
grass
As
grass
of
the
roofs
that
is
scorched
by
the
east
wind
27
But
I
well
know
when
you
sit
when
you
go
out
when
you
come
in
And
when
you
are
enraged
against
me
28
Because
your
rage
against
me
and
your
roaring
have
reached
my
ears
So
I
will
put
my
hook
in
your
nose
and
my
bridle
between
your
lips
And
I
will
lead
you
back
the
way
you
came
29
And
this
will
be
the
sign
for
you
This
year
you
will
eat
what
grows
on
its
own
and
in
the
second
year
you
will
eat
grain
that
sprouts
from
that
but
in
the
third
year
you
will
sow
seed
and
reap
and
you
will
plant
vineyards
and
eat
their
fruitage
30
Those
of
the
house
of
Judah
who
escape
those
who
are
left
will
take
root
downward
and
produce
fruit
upward
31
For
a
remnant
will
go
out
of
Jerusalem
and
survivors
from
Mount
Zion
The
zeal
of
Jehovah
of
armies
will
do
this
32
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
about
the
king
of
Assyria
He
will
not
come
into
this
cityOr
shoot
an
arrow
thereOr
confront
it
with
a
shieldOr
cast
up
a
siege
rampart
against
it
33
By
the
way
he
came
he
will
return
He
will
not
come
into
this
city

declares
Jehovah
34
I
will
defend
this
city
and
save
it
for
my
own
sakeAnd
for
the
sake
of
my
servant
David
35
On
that
very
night
the
angel
of
Jehovah
went
out
and
struck
down
185000
men
in
the
camp
of
the
Assyrians
When
people
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
they
saw
all
the
dead
bodies
36
So
King
Sennacherib
of
Assyria
departed
and
returned
to
Nineveh
and
stayed
there
37
And
as
he
was
bowing
down
at
the
house
of
his
god
Nisroch
his
own
sons
Adrammelech
and
Sharezer
struck
him
down
with
the
sword
and
then
escaped
to
the
land
of
Ararat
And
his
son
Esar-haddon
became
king
in
his
place
1
In
those
days
Hezekiah
became
sick
and
was
at
the
point
of
death
The
prophet
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
came
and
said
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Give
instructions
to
your
household
for
you
will
die
you
will
not
recover
2
At
that
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
began
to
pray
to
Jehovah
3
I
beg
you
O
Jehovah
remember
please
how
I
have
walked
before
you
faithfully
and
with
a
complete
heart
and
I
have
done
what
was
good
in
your
eyes
And
Hezekiah
began
to
weep
profusely
4
Isaiah
had
not
yet
gone
out
to
the
middle
courtyard
when
Jehovahs
word
came
to
him
saying
5
Go
back
and
say
to
Hezekiah
the
leader
of
my
people
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
David
your
forefather
says
I
have
heard
your
prayer
I
have
seen
your
tears
Here
I
am
healing
you
On
the
third
day
you
will
go
up
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
6
I
will
add
15
years
to
your
life
and
I
will
rescue
you
and
this
city
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria
and
I
will
defend
this
city
for
my
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
David
my
servant
7
Isaiah
then
said
Bring
a
cake
of
pressed
dried
figs
So
they
brought
it
and
applied
it
to
the
boil
after
which
he
gradually
recovered
8
Hezekiah
had
asked
Isaiah
What
is
the
sign
to
show
that
Jehovah
will
heal
me
and
that
I
will
go
up
on
the
third
day
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
9
Isaiah
replied
This
is
the
sign
from
Jehovah
to
show
you
that
Jehovah
will
carry
out
the
word
that
he
has
spoken
Do
you
want
the
shadow
on
the
stairway
to
move
forward
ten
steps
or
back
ten
steps
10
Hezekiah
said
It
is
an
easy
thing
for
the
shadow
to
extend
itself
ten
steps
but
not
to
go
back
ten
steps
11
So
Isaiah
the
prophet
called
out
to
Jehovah
and
He
made
the
shadow
on
the
stairway
of
Ahaz
go
back
ten
steps
after
it
had
already
descended
the
steps
12
At
that
time
the
king
of
Babylon
Berodach-baladan
son
of
Baladan
sent
letters
and
a
gift
to
Hezekiah
for
he
had
heard
that
Hezekiah
had
been
sick
13
Hezekiah
welcomed
them
and
showed
them
his
entire
treasure-house—the
silver
the
gold
the
balsam
oil
and
other
precious
oil
his
armory
and
everything
that
was
to
be
found
in
his
treasuries
There
was
nothing
that
Hezekiah
did
not
show
them
in
his
own
house
and
in
all
his
dominion
14
After
that
Isaiah
the
prophet
came
in
to
King
Hezekiah
and
asked
him
What
did
these
men
say
and
where
did
they
come
from
So
Hezekiah
said
They
came
from
a
distant
land
from
Babylon
15
Next
he
asked
What
did
they
see
in
your
house
Hezekiah
replied
They
saw
everything
in
my
house
There
was
nothing
that
I
did
not
show
them
in
my
treasuries
16
Isaiah
now
said
to
Hezekiah
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
17
Look
Days
are
coming
and
all
that
is
in
your
house
and
all
that
your
forefathers
have
stored
up
to
this
day
will
be
carried
off
to
Babylon
Nothing
will
be
left

says
Jehovah
18
And
some
of
your
own
sons
to
whom
you
will
become
father
will
be
taken
and
will
become
court
officials
in
the
palace
of
the
king
of
Babylon
19
At
that
Hezekiah
said
to
Isaiah
The
word
of
Jehovah
that
you
have
spoken
is
good
Then
he
added
It
is
good
if
there
will
be
peace
and
stability
during
my
lifetime
20
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Hezekiah
all
his
mightiness
and
how
he
made
the
pool
and
the
conduit
and
brought
the
water
into
the
city
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
21
Then
Hezekiah
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
his
son
Manasseh
became
king
in
his
place
1
Manasseh
was
12
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
55
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Hephzibah
2
He
did
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
following
the
detestable
practices
of
the
nations
that
Jehovah
had
driven
out
from
before
the
people
of
Israel
3
He
rebuilt
the
high
places
that
his
father
Hezekiah
had
destroyed
and
he
set
up
altars
to
Baal
and
made
a
sacred
pole
just
as
Ahab
the
king
of
Israel
had
done
And
he
bowed
down
to
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
and
served
them
4
He
also
built
altars
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
about
which
Jehovah
had
said
In
Jerusalem
I
will
put
my
name
5
And
he
built
altars
to
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
in
two
courtyards
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
6
And
he
made
his
own
son
pass
through
the
fire
he
practiced
magic
looked
for
omens
and
appointed
spirit
mediums
and
fortune-tellers
He
did
on
a
grand
scale
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
to
offend
him
7
He
put
the
carved
image
of
the
sacred
pole
that
he
made
into
the
house
about
which
Jehovah
had
said
to
David
and
to
his
son
Solomon
In
this
house
and
in
Jerusalem
which
I
have
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
I
will
permanently
put
my
name
8
And
I
will
never
again
make
the
feet
of
Israel
wander
from
the
land
that
I
gave
to
their
forefathers
provided
they
carefully
observe
all
that
I
have
commanded
them
the
entire
Law
that
my
servant
Moses
ordered
them
to
follow
9
But
they
did
not
obey
and
Manasseh
kept
leading
them
astray
causing
them
to
do
greater
evil
than
the
nations
that
Jehovah
had
annihilated
from
before
the
Israelites
10
Jehovah
kept
speaking
through
his
servants
the
prophets
saying
11
Manasseh
the
king
of
Judah
has
done
all
these
detestable
things
he
has
acted
more
wickedly
than
all
the
Amorites
before
him
and
he
has
made
Judah
sin
with
his
disgusting
idols
12
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
am
bringing
such
a
disaster
on
Jerusalem
and
Judah
that
it
will
make
both
ears
of
anyone
who
hears
about
it
tingle
13
And
I
will
stretch
out
on
Jerusalem
the
measuring
line
applied
to
Samaria
and
use
the
leveling
tool
applied
to
the
house
of
Ahab
and
I
will
wipe
Jerusalem
clean
just
as
one
wipes
a
bowl
clean
wiping
it
and
turning
it
upside
down
14
I
will
forsake
the
remnant
of
my
inheritance
and
give
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
they
will
become
plunder
and
spoil
to
all
their
enemies
15
because
they
did
what
was
bad
in
my
eyes
and
were
continually
offending
me
from
the
day
that
their
forefathers
came
out
of
Egypt
to
this
day
16
Manasseh
also
shed
innocent
blood
in
very
great
quantity
until
he
had
filled
Jerusalem
from
one
end
to
the
other
besides
his
sin
of
causing
Judah
to
sin
by
doing
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
17
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Manasseh
and
all
that
he
did
and
the
sins
that
he
committed
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
18
Then
Manasseh
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
in
the
garden
of
his
house
in
the
garden
of
Uzza
and
his
son
Amon
became
king
in
his
place
19
Amon
was
22
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
two
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Meshullemeth
the
daughter
of
Haruz
from
Jotbah
20
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
just
as
his
father
Manasseh
had
done
21
He
kept
walking
in
all
the
ways
that
his
father
walked
and
he
continued
serving
and
bowing
down
to
the
disgusting
idols
that
his
father
had
served
22
So
he
abandoned
Jehovah
the
God
of
his
forefathers
and
he
did
not
walk
in
the
way
of
Jehovah
23
Eventually
Amons
servants
conspired
against
him
and
put
the
king
to
death
in
his
own
house
24
But
the
people
of
the
land
struck
down
all
those
who
conspired
against
King
Amon
and
they
made
his
son
Josiah
king
in
his
place
25
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Amon
what
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
26
So
they
buried
him
in
his
grave
in
the
garden
of
Uzza
and
his
son
Josiah
became
king
in
his
place
1
Josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
31
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Jedidah
the
daughter
of
Adaiah
from
Bozkath
2
He
did
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
and
walked
in
all
the
ways
of
David
his
forefather
and
he
did
not
deviate
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
3
In
the
18th
year
of
King
Josiah
the
king
sent
Shaphan
the
secretary
the
son
of
Azaliah
the
son
of
Meshullam
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
saying
4
Go
up
to
Hilkiah
the
high
priest
and
let
him
collect
all
the
money
that
is
being
brought
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
which
the
doorkeepers
have
collected
from
the
people
5
Have
them
give
it
to
those
appointed
over
the
work
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
who
in
turn
will
give
it
to
the
workers
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
who
are
to
repair
the
damage
to
the
house
6
that
is
to
the
craftsmen
the
builders
and
the
masons
and
they
are
to
use
it
to
buy
timbers
and
hewn
stones
to
repair
the
house
7
But
no
accounting
should
be
required
of
them
for
the
money
that
they
are
given
because
they
are
trustworthy
8
Later
Hilkiah
the
high
priest
said
to
Shaphan
the
secretary
I
have
found
the
book
of
the
Law
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
So
Hilkiah
gave
the
book
to
Shaphan
who
began
to
read
it
9
Then
Shaphan
the
secretary
went
to
the
king
and
told
him
Your
servants
have
poured
out
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
and
they
have
handed
it
over
to
those
appointed
over
the
work
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
10
Shaphan
the
secretary
also
told
the
king
There
is
a
book
that
Hilkiah
the
priest
has
given
me
Then
Shaphan
began
to
read
it
before
the
king
11
As
soon
as
the
king
heard
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
Law
he
ripped
his
garments
apart
12
Then
the
king
gave
this
order
to
Hilkiah
the
priest
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
Achbor
the
son
of
Micaiah
Shaphan
the
secretary
and
Asaiah
the
kings
servant
13
Go
inquire
of
Jehovah
in
my
behalf
in
behalf
of
the
people
and
in
behalf
of
all
Judah
concerning
the
words
of
this
book
that
has
been
found
for
Jehovahs
rage
that
has
been
set
ablaze
against
us
is
great
because
our
forefathers
did
not
obey
the
words
of
this
book
by
observing
all
that
is
written
concerning
us
14
So
Hilkiah
the
priest
Ahikam
Achbor
Shaphan
and
Asaiah
went
to
Huldah
the
prophetess
She
was
the
wife
of
Shallum
son
of
Tikvah
son
of
Harhas
the
caretaker
of
the
wardrobe
and
she
was
dwelling
in
the
Second
Quarter
of
Jerusalem
and
they
spoke
to
her
there
15
She
said
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Tell
the
man
who
sent
you
to
me
16
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
will
bring
calamity
on
this
place
and
its
inhabitants
all
the
words
of
the
book
that
the
king
of
Judah
has
read
17
Because
they
have
abandoned
me
and
are
making
sacrifices
smoke
to
other
gods
in
order
to
offend
me
with
all
the
work
of
their
hands
my
rage
will
be
set
ablaze
against
this
place
and
it
will
not
be
extinguished
18
But
to
the
king
of
Judah
who
sent
you
to
inquire
of
Jehovah
this
is
what
you
should
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Regarding
the
words
that
you
have
heard
19
because
your
heart
was
responsive
and
you
humbled
yourself
before
Jehovah
on
hearing
what
I
have
spoken
against
this
place
and
its
inhabitants—that
they
would
become
an
object
of
horror
and
a
curse—and
you
ripped
your
garments
apart
and
wept
before
me
I
also
have
heard
you
declares
Jehovah
20
That
is
why
I
will
gather
you
to
your
ancestors
and
you
will
be
laid
in
your
grave
in
peace
and
your
eyes
will
not
see
all
the
calamity
that
I
will
bring
on
this
place
Then
they
brought
the
reply
to
the
king
1
So
the
king
sent
word
and
they
summoned
all
the
elders
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
2
After
that
the
king
went
up
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
with
all
the
men
of
Judah
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
the
priests
and
the
prophets—all
the
people
from
small
to
great
He
read
in
their
hearing
all
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
covenant
that
had
been
found
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
3
The
king
stood
by
the
pillar
and
made
a
covenant
before
Jehovah
that
he
would
follow
Jehovah
and
keep
his
commandments
his
reminders
and
his
statutes
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
by
carrying
out
the
words
of
this
covenant
that
were
written
in
this
book
And
all
the
people
agreed
to
the
covenant
4
The
king
then
ordered
Hilkiah
the
high
priest
the
priests
of
the
second
rank
and
the
doorkeepers
to
bring
out
from
the
temple
of
Jehovah
all
the
utensils
made
for
Baal
for
the
sacred
pole
and
for
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
Then
he
burned
them
outside
Jerusalem
on
the
terraces
of
Kidron
and
he
took
their
ashes
to
Bethel
5
So
he
put
out
of
business
the
foreign-god
priests
whom
the
kings
of
Judah
had
appointed
to
make
sacrificial
smoke
on
the
high
places
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
the
surroundings
of
Jerusalem
as
well
as
those
making
sacrificial
smoke
to
Baal
to
the
sun
to
the
moon
to
the
constellations
of
the
zodiac
and
to
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
6
He
brought
the
sacred
pole
out
from
the
house
of
Jehovah
to
the
outskirts
of
Jerusalem
to
the
Kidron
Valley
and
he
burned
it
in
the
Kidron
Valley
and
ground
it
to
dust
and
scattered
its
dust
on
the
graves
of
the
common
people
7
He
also
tore
down
the
houses
of
the
male
temple
prostitutes
which
were
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
where
the
women
were
weaving
tent
shrines
for
the
sacred
pole
8
Then
he
brought
all
the
priests
out
of
the
cities
of
Judah
and
he
made
unfit
for
worship
the
high
places
where
the
priests
had
been
making
sacrificial
smoke
from
Geba
to
Beer-sheba
He
also
tore
down
the
high
places
of
the
gates
that
were
at
the
entrance
of
the
gate
of
Joshua
the
chief
of
the
city
which
were
on
the
left
as
one
entered
the
city
gate
9
The
priests
of
the
high
places
did
not
serve
at
the
altar
of
Jehovah
in
Jerusalem
but
they
did
eat
unleavened
bread
along
with
their
brothers
10
He
also
made
unfit
for
worship
Topheth
which
is
in
the
Valley
of
the
Sons
of
Hinnom
so
that
no
one
could
make
his
son
or
his
daughter
pass
through
the
fire
to
Molech
11
And
he
prohibited
the
horses
that
the
kings
of
Judah
had
dedicated
to
the
sun
from
entering
the
house
of
Jehovah
by
the
chamber
of
Nathan-melech
the
court
official
which
was
in
the
porticoes
and
he
burned
the
chariots
of
the
sun
in
the
fire
12
The
king
also
tore
down
the
altars
that
the
kings
of
Judah
had
set
up
on
the
roof
of
Ahazs
upper
chamber
as
well
as
the
altars
that
Manasseh
had
set
up
in
two
courtyards
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
He
crushed
them
and
scattered
their
dust
in
the
Kidron
Valley
13
And
the
king
made
unfit
for
worship
the
high
places
in
front
of
Jerusalem
that
were
to
the
south
of
the
Mount
of
Ruination
which
Solomon
the
king
of
Israel
had
built
to
Ashtoreth
the
disgusting
goddess
of
the
Sidonians
and
to
Chemosh
the
disgusting
god
of
Moab
and
to
Milcom
the
detestable
god
of
the
Ammonites
14
He
broke
the
sacred
pillars
to
pieces
and
cut
down
the
sacred
poles
and
filled
their
places
with
human
bones
15
He
also
tore
down
the
altar
in
Bethel
the
high
place
that
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
had
made
that
caused
Israel
to
sin
After
tearing
down
that
altar
and
the
high
place
he
burned
the
high
place
ground
it
to
dust
and
burned
the
sacred
pole
16
When
Josiah
turned
and
saw
the
graves
on
the
mountain
he
had
the
bones
taken
from
the
graves
and
burned
them
on
the
altar
making
it
unfit
for
worship
according
to
Jehovahs
word
that
had
been
proclaimed
by
the
man
of
the
true
God
who
foretold
that
these
things
would
happen
17
Then
he
said
What
is
the
gravestone
over
there
that
I
am
looking
at
At
this
the
men
of
the
city
said
to
him
It
is
the
grave
of
the
man
of
the
true
God
from
Judah
who
foretold
these
things
that
you
have
done
against
the
altar
of
Bethel
18
So
he
said
Let
him
rest
Do
not
let
anyone
disturb
his
bones
So
they
left
his
bones
undisturbed
as
well
as
the
bones
of
the
prophet
who
had
come
from
Samaria
19
Josiah
also
removed
all
the
houses
of
worship
on
the
high
places
that
were
in
the
cities
of
Samaria
which
the
kings
of
Israel
had
built
to
offend
God
and
he
did
the
same
thing
to
them
that
he
had
done
at
Bethel
20
So
he
sacrificed
on
the
altars
all
the
priests
of
the
high
places
who
were
there
and
he
burned
human
bones
on
them
After
that
he
returned
to
Jerusalem
21
The
king
now
commanded
all
the
people
Hold
a
Passover
to
Jehovah
your
God
as
is
written
in
this
book
of
the
covenant
22
No
Passover
like
this
had
been
held
since
the
days
when
the
judges
had
judged
Israel
or
in
all
the
days
of
the
kings
of
Israel
and
the
kings
of
Judah
23
But
in
the
18th
year
of
King
Josiah
this
Passover
to
Jehovah
was
held
in
Jerusalem
24
Josiah
also
cleared
out
the
spirit
mediums
the
fortune-tellers
the
teraphim
statues
the
disgusting
idols
and
all
the
disgusting
things
that
had
appeared
in
the
land
of
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem
in
order
to
carry
out
the
words
of
the
Law
that
were
written
in
the
book
that
Hilkiah
the
priest
had
found
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
25
There
was
no
king
like
him
prior
to
him
who
returned
to
Jehovah
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
and
with
all
his
strength
according
to
all
the
Law
of
Moses
nor
did
anyone
like
him
rise
up
after
him
26
Nevertheless
Jehovah
did
not
turn
away
from
his
burning
anger
that
blazed
against
Judah
because
of
all
the
offensive
things
that
Manasseh
had
done
to
offend
Him
27
Jehovah
said
I
will
also
remove
Judah
from
my
sight
just
as
I
removed
Israel
and
I
will
reject
this
city
that
I
chose
Jerusalem
and
the
house
about
which
I
said
My
name
will
continue
there
28
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Josiah
all
that
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
29
In
his
days
Pharaoh
Nechoh
the
king
of
Egypt
came
to
meet
the
king
of
Assyria
by
the
Euphrates
River
and
King
Josiah
went
out
to
confront
him
but
when
Nechoh
saw
him
he
put
him
to
death
at
Megiddo
30
So
his
servants
transported
his
dead
body
in
a
chariot
from
Megiddo
and
brought
him
to
Jerusalem
and
buried
him
in
his
grave
Then
the
people
of
the
land
took
Josiahs
son
Jehoahaz
and
anointed
him
and
made
him
king
in
place
of
his
father
31
Jehoahaz
was
23
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
three
months
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Hamutal
the
daughter
of
Jeremiah
from
Libnah
32
He
began
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
according
to
all
that
his
forefathers
had
done
33
Pharaoh
Nechoh
imprisoned
him
at
Riblah
in
the
land
of
Hamath
to
keep
him
from
reigning
in
Jerusalem
and
then
imposed
on
the
land
a
fine
of
100
silver
talents
and
a
gold
talent
34
Furthermore
Pharaoh
Nechoh
made
Josiahs
son
Eliakim
king
in
place
of
his
father
Josiah
and
changed
his
name
to
Jehoiakim
but
he
took
Jehoahaz
and
brought
him
to
Egypt
where
he
eventually
died
35
Jehoiakim
gave
the
silver
and
the
gold
to
Pharaoh
but
he
had
to
tax
the
land
to
give
the
silver
that
Pharaoh
demanded
He
exacted
an
assessed
amount
of
silver
and
gold
from
each
of
the
people
of
the
land
to
give
to
Pharaoh
Nechoh
36
Jehoiakim
was
25
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
11
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Zebidah
the
daughter
of
Pedaiah
from
Rumah
37
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
according
to
all
that
his
forefathers
had
done
1
In
Jehoiakims
days
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
came
against
him
and
Jehoiakim
became
his
servant
for
three
years
However
he
turned
against
him
and
rebelled
2
Then
Jehovah
began
to
send
against
him
marauder
bands
of
Chaldeans
Syrians
Moabites
and
Ammonites
He
kept
sending
them
against
Judah
to
destroy
it
according
to
Jehovahs
word
that
he
had
spoken
through
his
servants
the
prophets
3
Surely
it
was
by
the
order
of
Jehovah
that
this
happened
to
Judah
to
remove
them
from
his
sight
because
of
all
the
sins
that
Manasseh
had
committed
4
and
also
the
innocent
blood
that
he
had
shed
for
he
had
filled
Jerusalem
with
innocent
blood
and
Jehovah
was
not
willing
to
forgive
5
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehoiakim
all
that
he
did
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Judah
6
Then
Jehoiakim
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
his
son
Jehoiachin
became
king
in
his
place
7
Never
again
did
the
king
of
Egypt
venture
out
of
his
land
for
the
king
of
Babylon
had
taken
all
that
belonged
to
the
king
of
Egypt
from
the
Wadi
of
Egypt
up
to
the
Euphrates
River
8
Jehoiachin
was
18
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
three
months
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Nehushta
the
daughter
of
Elnathan
of
Jerusalem
9
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
according
to
all
that
his
father
had
done
10
During
that
time
the
servants
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
came
up
against
Jerusalem
and
the
city
came
under
siege
11
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
came
to
the
city
while
his
servants
were
laying
siege
to
it
12
King
Jehoiachin
of
Judah
went
out
to
the
king
of
Babylon
along
with
his
mother
his
servants
his
princes
and
his
court
officials
and
the
king
of
Babylon
took
him
captive
in
the
eighth
year
of
his
reign
13
Then
he
took
out
from
there
all
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
treasures
of
the
kings
house
He
cut
into
pieces
all
the
gold
utensils
that
Solomon
the
king
of
Israel
had
made
in
the
temple
of
Jehovah
just
as
Jehovah
had
foretold
14
He
took
into
exile
all
Jerusalem
all
the
princes
all
the
mighty
warriors
and
every
craftsman
and
metalworker—he
took
10000
into
exile
No
one
was
left
behind
except
the
poorest
people
of
the
land
15
Thus
he
took
Jehoiachin
into
exile
to
Babylon
he
also
led
away
the
kings
mother
the
kings
wives
his
court
officials
and
the

men
of
the
land
taking
them
into

from

to

16
The

also

to

all

warriors
7000
as
well
as
1000
craftsmen
and
metalworkers
all
of
them
mighty
men
and
trained
for
war
17
The

of

made
Mattaniah
Jehoiachins
uncle
king
in
his
place
and
changed
his
name
to

18

in

name
was

19
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
according
to
all
that
Jehoiakim
had
done
20
It
was
because
of
Jehovahs
anger
that
these
things
took
place
in
Jerusalem
and
in
Judah
until
he
cast
them
out
of
his
sight
And
Zedekiah
rebelled
against
the
king
of

4

was
broken

and
all
the

fled
by

through
the
gate
between
the
double
wall
near
the
kings
garden
while
the
Chaldeans
were
surrounding
the
city
and
the
king
went
by
the
way
of
the
Arabah
5
But
the
Chaldean
army
pursued
the
king
and
they
overtook
him
in
the
desert
plains
of
Jericho
and
all
his
troops
were
scattered
from
his
side
6
Then
they
seized
the
king
and
brought
him
up
to
the
king
of
Babylon
at
Riblah
and
they
passed
sentence
on
him
7
They
slaughtered
Zedekiahs
sons
before
his
eyes
then
Nebuchadnezzar
blinded
Zedekiahs
eyes
bound
him
with
copper
fetters
and
brought
him
to
Babylon
8
In
the
fifth
month
on

9

the
kings
house
and
all
the
houses
of

he
also
burned
down
the
house
of
every

man
10
And
the
walls
surrounding
Jerusalem
were
pulled
down
by
the
entire
Chaldean
army
that
was
with
the
chief
of
the
guard
11
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
took
into
exile
the
rest
of
the
people
who
were
left
in
the
city
the
deserters
who
had
gone
over
to
the
king
of
Babylon
and
the
rest
of
the
population
12
But
the
chief
of
the
guard
left
some
of
the
poorest
people
of
the
land
to
serve
as
vinedressers
and
as
compulsory
laborers
13
And
the
Chaldeans
broke
into
pieces
the
copper
pillars
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
carriages
and
the
copper
Sea
that
were
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
they
carried
the
copper
away
to
Babylon
14
They
also
took
the
cans
the
shovels
the
extinguishers
the
cups
and
all
the
copper
utensils
used
in
the
temple
service
15
The
chief
of
the
guard
took
the
fire
holders
and
the
bowls
that
were
of
genuine
gold
and
silver
16
As
for
the
two
pillars
the
Sea
and
the
carriages
that
Solomon
had
made
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
copper
of
all
these
articles
was
beyond
weighing
17
Each
pillar
was
18
cubits
high
and
the
capital
on
it
was
of
copper
and
the
height
of
the
capital
was
three
cubits
and
the
network
and
pomegranates
all
around
on
the
capital
were
all
made
of
copper
The
second
pillar
with
its
network
was
like
it
18
The
chief
of
the
guard
also
took
Seraiah
the
chief
priest
Zephaniah
the
second
priest
and
the
three
doorkeepers
19
And
he
took
from
the
city
one
court
official
who
was
the
commissioner
over
the
soldiers
five
close
associates
of
the
king
who
were
found
in
the
city
as
well
as
the
secretary
of
the
chief
of
the
army
the
one
mustering
the
people
of
the
land
and
60
men
of
the
common
people
of
the
land
who
were
yet
found
in
the
city
20
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
took
them
and
brought
them
to
the
king
of
Babylon
at
Riblah
21
The
king
of
Babylon
struck
them
down
and
put
them
to
death
at
Riblah
in
the
land
of
Hamath
Thus
Judah
went
into
exile
from
its
land
22
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
appointed
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
over
the
people
whom
he
had
left
behind
in
the
land
of

23
When
all
the
army

and
their

heard
that
the

had
appointed

they
immediately
came
to

They

the

of
Tanhumeth
the
Netophathite
and
Jaazaniah
the
son
of
the
Maacathite
together
with
their
men
24
Gedaliah
swore
an
oath
to
them
and
their
men
and
said
to
them
Do
not
be
afraid
of
being
servants
to
the
Chaldeans
Live
in
the
land
and
serve
the
king
of
Babylon
and
it
will
go
well
with
you
25
And
in
the
seventh
month
Ishmael
son
of
Nethaniah
son
of
Elishama
who
was
of
the
royal
line
came
with
ten
other
men
and
they
struck
down
Gedaliah
and
he
died
along
with
the
Jews
and
the
Chaldeans
who
were
with
him
in
Mizpah
26
After
that
all
the
people
from
small
to
great
including
the
army
chiefs
rose
up
and
went
to
Egypt
for
they
were
afraid
of
the
Chaldeans
27
And
in
the

These

the

Israels
firstborn
He
was
the
firstborn
but
because

the
bed
of
his
father
his
right
as
firstborn
was
given
to
the
sons
of
Joseph
the
son
of
Israel
so
he
was
not
enrolled
genealogically
for
the
right
of
the

2
Though
Judah
was
superior

and

son
of
Shema
son
of

who
lived

and

9
To

he

at
the

River
for
their
livestock
had
become
numerous
in
the
land
of
Gilead
10
In
the
days
of
Saul
they
waged
war
against
the

who
were
defeated
before

so
they
dwelled
in
their

throughout
all
the
territory
east
of

in

and
its
dependent
towns
and
in

the

17
They

and
in
the
days
of
King
Jeroboam
of
Israel
18
The
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half

of
Manasseh
had
44760
mighty
warriors
in
their
army
who
carried
shields
and
swords
and
were
armed
with
bows
and
they
were
trained
in
war
19
They
waged
war
against
the
Hagrites
Jetur
Naphish
and
Nodab
20
And
they
were
helped
in
fighting
them
so
that
the
Hagrites
and
all
who
were
with
them
were
given
into
their
hand
for
they
called
to
God
for
help
in
the
war
and
he
responded
to
their
entreaty
because
they
trusted
in
him
21
They
captured
their
livestock—50000
camels
250000
sheep
and
2000
donkeys—as
well
as
100000
people
22
Many
had
fallen
slain
because
the
war
was
waged
by
the
true
God
And
they
lived
in
their
place
until
the
time
of
the
exile
23
The
descendants
of
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
lived
in
the
land
from
Bashan
to
Baal-hermon
and
Senir
and

Hermon
They
were
numerous
24
These
were
the
heads
of
their
paternal
houses
Epher
Ishi
Eliel
Azriel
Jeremiah
Hodaviah
and
Jahdiel
they
were
mighty
warriors
men
of
fame
and
heads
of
their
paternal
houses
25
But
they
acted
unfaithfully
toward
the
God
of
their
forefathers
and
prostituted
themselves
to
the
gods
of
the
peoples
of
the
land
whom
God
had
annihilated
from
before
them
26
So
the
God
of
Israel
stirred
up
the
spirit
of
King
Pul
of
Assyria
that
is
King
Tilgath-pilneser
of
Assyria
so
that
he
took
into
exile
those
of
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
and
brought
them
to

All
those
selected

at

numbered
212
They
were
in
their
settlements
by
their
genealogical
enrollment
David
and
Samuel
the
seer
appointed
these
to
their
office
of
trust
23
They
and
their
sons
were
over
the
guard
service
for
the
gates
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
house
of
the
tent
24
The
gatekeepers
were
on
the
four
sides—east
west
north
and
south
25
From
time
to
time
their
brothers
were
to
come
in
from
their
settlements
for
seven
days
to
serve
along
with
them
26
There
were
four
chief
gatekeepers
in
the
office
of
trust
They
were
Levites
and
they
were
in
charge
of
the
chambers
and
of
the
treasuries
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
27
They
would
spend
the
night
in
their
stations
all
around
the
house
of
the
true
God
for
they
cared
for
the
guard
service
and
were
in
charge
of
the
key
and
would
open
up
the
house
from
morning
to
morning
28
Some
of
them
were
in
charge
of
the
utensils
of
the
service
they
would
count
them
when
they
brought
them
in
and
count
them
when
they
took
them
out

Some
of
their
brothers
of
the
Kohathites
were

sabbath
33
These
were
the
singers
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
Levites
in
the
chambers
those
set
free
from
other
duties
for
by
day
and
by
night
it
was
their
responsibility
to
be
on
duty
34
These
were
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
Levites
by
their
line
of
descent
headmen
These
lived
in
Jerusalem
35
The
father
of

son
was

and

And
they
all
lived

along

their
other
brothers
39

Kish
became

Malchi-shua
Abinadab
and

40
And
Jonathans

was

41
And
the
sons
of
Micah
were

Melech
Tahrea
and
Ahaz
42
Ahaz
became

to
Jarah
Jarah
became

son

son
44
Azel
had
six
sons
and
their
names
were
Azrikam

Ishmael
Sheariah
Obadiah
and
Hanan
These
were
the
sons
of
Azel
1
Now
the
Philistines
were
fighting
against
Israel
And
the
men
of
Israel
fled
from
before
the
Philistines
and
many
fell
slain
on
Mount
Gilboa
2
The
Philistines
kept
in
close
range
of
Saul
and
his
sons
and
the
Philistines
struck
down
Jonathan
Abinadab
and
Malchi-shua
Sauls
sons
3
The
fighting
grew
fierce
against
Saul
and
the
archers
found
him
and
he
was
wounded
by
the
archers
4
Then
Saul
said
to
his
armor-bearer
Draw
your
sword
and
run
me
through
with
it
so
that
these
uncircumcised
men
may
not
come
and
deal
ruthlessly
with
me
But
his
armor-bearer
was
unwilling
because
he
was
very
much
afraid
So
Saul
took
the
sword
and
fell
on
it
5
When
his
armor-bearer
saw
that
Saul
was
dead
he
too
fell
on
his
own
sword
and
died
6
Thus
Saul
and
his
three
sons
died
and
all
those
of
his
house
died
together
7
When
all
the
people
of
Israel
in
the
valley
saw
that
everyone
had
fled
and
that
Saul
and
his
sons
had
died
they
began
to
abandon
their
cities
and
flee
the
Philistines
then
came
and
occupied
them
8
The
next
day
when
the
Philistines
came
to
strip
the
slain
they
found
Saul
and
his
sons
fallen
on
Mount
Gilboa
9
So
they
stripped
him
and
took
off
his
head
and
his
armor
and
they
sent
word
throughout
the
land
of
the
Philistines
to
spread
the
news
to
their
idols
and
the
people
10
Then
they
put
his
armor
in
the
house
of
their
god
and
fastened
his
skull
to
the
house
of
Dagon
11
When
all
those
of
Jabesh
in
Gilead
heard
about
all
that
the
Philistines
had
done
to
Saul
12
all
the
warriors
rose
up
and
carried
off
the
corpse
of
Saul
and
the
corpses
of
his
sons
They
brought
them
to
Jabesh
and
buried
their
bones
under
the
big
tree
in
Jabesh
and
they
fasted
for
seven
days
13
Thus
Saul
died
for
the
unfaithfulness
he
had
shown
against
Jehovah
because
he
had
not
obeyed
the
word
of
Jehovah
also
for
consulting
a
spirit
medium
14
instead
of
inquiring
of
Jehovah
So
He
put
him
to
death
and
turned
the
kingship
over
to
David
the
son
of
Jesse
1
In
time
all
the
Israelites
gathered
to
David
at
Hebron
and
said
Look
We
are
your
own
bone
and
flesh
2
In
times
past
while
Saul
was
king
you
were
the
one
who
was
leading
Israel
on
its
campaigns
And
Jehovah
your
God
said
to
you
You
will
shepherd
my
people
Israel
and
you
will
become
leader
over
my
people
Israel
3
So
all
the
elders
of
Israel
came
to
the
king
at
Hebron
and
David
made
a
covenant
with
them
in
Hebron
before
Jehovah
Then
they
anointed
David
as
king
over
Israel
according
to
Jehovahs
word
through
Samuel
4
Later
David
and
all
Israel
set
out
for
Jerusalem
that
is
Jebus
where
the
Jebusites
were
inhabiting
the
land
5
The
inhabitants
of
Jebus
taunted
David
You
will
never
come
in
here
However
David
captured
the
stronghold
of
Zion
which
is
now
the
City
of
David
6
So
David
said
Whoever
is
the
first
to
strike
the
Jebusites
will
become
chief
and
prince
And
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
went
up
first
and
he
became
the
chief
7
Then
David
took
up
residence
in
the
stronghold
That
is
why
they
called
it
the
City
of
David
8
He
began
to
build
up
the
city
all
around
from
the
Mound
to
the
areas
around
it
and
Joab
restored
the
rest
of
the
city
9
Thus
David
became
greater
and
greater
and
Jehovah
of
armies
was
with
him
10
Now
these
are
the
heads
of
Davids
mighty
warriors
who
gave
him
strong
support
in
his
kingship
together
with
all
Israel
to
make
him
king
according
to
Jehovahs
word
concerning
Israel
11
This
is
the
list
of
Davids
mighty
warriors
Jashobeam
the
son
of
a
Hachmonite
the
head
of
the
three
He
brandished
his
spear
over
300
slain
at
one
time
12
Next
to
him
was
Eleazar
the
son
of
Dodo
the
Ahohite
He
was
among
the
three
mighty
warriors
13
He
was
with
David
at
Pas-dammim
where
the
Philistines
had
gathered
together
for
war
Now
there
was
a
plot
of
land
full
of
barley
and
the
people
had
fled
because
of
the
Philistines
14
But
he
took
his
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
field
and
defended
it
and
kept
striking
down
the
Philistines
so
that
Jehovah
brought
about
a
great
victory
15
Three
of
the
30
headmen
went
down
to
the
rock
to
David
at
the
cave
of
Adullam
while
a
Philistine
army
was
camped
in
the
Valley
of
Rephaim
16
David
was
then
in
the
stronghold
and
a
garrison
of
the
Philistines
was
in
Bethlehem
17
Then
David
expressed
his
longing
If
only
I
could
have
a
drink
of
the
water
from
the
cistern
by
the
gate
of
Bethlehem
18
At
that
the
three
forced
their
way
into
the
camp
of
the
Philistines
and
drew
water
from
the
cistern
by
the
gate
of
Bethlehem
and
brought
it
to
David
but
David
refused
to
drink
it
and
poured
it
out
to
Jehovah
19
He
said
It
is
unthinkable
on
my
part
from
the
standpoint
of
my
God
to
do
this
Should
I
drink
the
blood
of
these
men
who
risked
their
lives
For
it
was
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
that
they
brought
it
So
he
refused
to
drink
it
These
are
the
things
that
his
three
mighty
warriors
did
20
Abishai
the
brother
of
Joab
became
head
of
another
three
he
brandished
his
spear
over
300
slain
and
he
had
a
reputation
like
the
three
21
Of
the
other
three
he
was
more
distinguished
than
two
of
them
and
he
was
their
chief
yet
he
did
not
attain
to
the
rank
of
the
first
three
22
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
a
courageous
man
who
performed
many
exploits
in
Kabzeel
He
struck
down
the
two
sons
of
Ariel
of
Moab
and
he
descended
into
a
waterpit
on
a
snowy
day
and
killed
a
lion
23
He
also
struck
down
an
Egyptian
man
of
extraordinary
size—five
cubits
tall
Though
the
Egyptian
had
a
spear
in
his
hand
like
the
beam
of
loom
workers
he
went
against
him
with
a
rod
and
snatched
the
spear
away
from
the
Egyptians
hand
and
killed
him
with
his
own
spear
24
These
things
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
did
and
he
had
a
reputation
like
that
of
the
three
mighty
warriors
25
Although
he
was
distinguished
even
more
than
the
thirty
he
did
not
attain
to
the
rank
of
the
three
However
David
appointed
him
over
his
own
bodyguard

and
Zebadiah
the
sons
of
Jeroham
of
Gedor
8
Some
of
the
Gadites
went
over
to
Davids
side
at
the
stronghold
in
the
wilderness
they
were
mighty
warriors
soldiers
trained
for
war
standing
ready
with
the
large
shield
and
the
lance
whose
faces
were
like
those
of
lions
and
who
were
as
swift
as
the
gazelles
on
the
mountains
9
Ezer
was
the
head
Obadiah
the
second
Eliab
the
third
10
Mishmannah
the
fourth
Jeremiah
the
fifth
11
Attai
the
sixth
Eliel
the
seventh
12
Johanan
the
eighth
Elzabad
the
ninth
13
Jeremiah
the
tenth
Machbannai
the
eleventh
14
These
were
of
the
Gadites
heads
of
the
army
The
least
one
was
equal
to
100
and
the
greatest
to
1000
15
These
are
the
men
who
crossed
the
Jordan
in
the
first
month
when
it
was
overflowing
its
banks
and
they
chased
away
all
those
living
in
the
lowlands
to
the
east
and
to
the
west
16
Some
of
the
men
of
Benjamin
and
Judah
also
came
to
David
at
his
stronghold
17
Then
David
went
out
before
them
and
said
to
them
If
you
have
come
to
me
in
peace
to
help
me
my
heart
will
be
united
with
you
But
if
it
is
to
betray
me
to
my
adversaries
when
my
hands
have
done
no
wrong
let
the
God
of
our
forefathers
see
it
and
judge
18
Then
the
spirit
came
upon
Amasai
the
head
of
the
thirty
We
are
yours
O
David
and
we
are
with
you
O
son
of
Jesse
Peace
peace
be
yours
and
peace
to
the
one
helping
you
For
your
God
is
helping
you
So
David
received
them
and
appointed
them
among
the
heads
of
the
troops
19
Some
from
Manasseh
also
deserted
to
David
when
he
came
with
the
Philistines
to
battle
against
Saul
but
he
did
not
help
the
Philistines
for
after
consultation
the
lords
of
the
Philistines
sent
him
away
saying
He
will
desert
to
his
lord
Saul
and
it
will
cost
us
our
heads
20
When
he
went
to
Ziklag
these
deserted
to
him
from
Manasseh
Adnah
Jozabad
Jediael
Michael
Jozabad
Elihu
and
Zillethai
heads
of
the
thousands
of
Manasseh
21
They
helped
David
against
the
marauder
band
because
all
of
them
were
mighty
courageous
men
and
they
became
chiefs
in
the
army
22
Day
after
day
people
kept
coming
to
David
to
help
him
until
it
was
a
camp
as
great
as
the
camp
of
God
23
This
is
the
number
of
the
heads
of
those
armed
for
battle
who
came
to
David
at
Hebron
to
turn
the
kingship
of
Saul
over
to
him
according
to
Jehovahs
order
24
The
men
of
Judah
carrying
the
large
shield
and
the
lance
were
6800
armed
for
battle
25
Of
the
Simeonites
the
mighty
courageous
men
of
the
army
were
7100
26
Of
the
Levites
4600
27
Jehoiada
was
the
leader
of
the
sons
of
Aaron
and
with
him
were
3700
28
as
well
as
Zadok
a
mighty
and
courageous
young
man
along
with
22
chiefs
from
his
paternal
house
29
Of
the
Benjaminites
the
brothers
of
Saul
there
were
3000
of
whom
the
greater
number
had
previously
been
guarding
the
interests
of
the
house
of
Saul
30
Of
the
Ephraimites
there
were
20800
mighty
courageous
men
of
fame
among
their
paternal
houses
31
Of
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
there
were
18000
who
had
been
designated
by
name
to
come
to
make
David
king
32
Of
the
tribe
of
Issachar
who
understood
the
times
and
knew
what
Israel
should
do
there
were
200
of
their
headmen
and
all
their
brothers
were
under
their
command
33
Of
Zebulun
there
were
50000
who
could
serve
in
the
army
drawing
up
in
battle
formation
with
all
the
weapons
of
war
all
joining
David
with
undivided
loyalty
34
Of
Naphtali
there
were
1000
chiefs
and
with
them
were
37000
with
the
large
shield
and
the
spear
35
Of
the
Danites
those
drawing
up
in
battle
formation
were
28600
36
And
of
Asher
those
who
could
serve
in
the
army
for
drawing
up
in
battle
formation
were
40000
37
From
across
the
Jordan
of
the
Reubenites
the
Gadites
and
the
half
tribe
of
Manasseh
there
were
120000
soldiers
with
all
kinds
of
weapons
of
war
38
All
of
these
were
men
of
war
joining
together
in
battle
line
they
came
with
a
complete
heart
to
Hebron
to
make
David
king
over
all
Israel
and
also
all
the
rest
of
Israel
were
united
in
wanting
to
make
David
king
39
And
they
remained
there
with
David
for
three
days
eating
and
drinking
for
their
brothers
had
made
preparation
for
them
40
Also
those
near
them
and
even
those
as
far
as
Issachar
Zebulun
and
Naphtali
were
bringing
food
on
donkeys
camels
mules
and
cattle—provisions
of
flour
cakes
of
pressed
figs
and
raisins
wine
oil
and
cattle
and
sheep
in
great
quantity
for
there
was
rejoicing
in
Israel
1
David
consulted
with
the
chiefs
of
the
thousands
and
of
the
hundreds
and
with
every
leader
2
Then
David
said
to
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
If
it
seems
good
to
you
and
it
is
acceptable
to
Jehovah
our
God
let
us
send
word
to
our
remaining
brothers
in
all
regions
of
Israel
and
also
to
the
priests
and
the
Levites
in
their
cities
with
pastures
to
come
and
join
us
3
And
let
us
bring
back
the
Ark
of
our
God
For
they
had
not
cared
for
it
in
the
days
of
Saul
4
All
the
congregation
agreed
to
do
that
for
it
seemed
right
to
all
the
people
5
So
David
congregated
all
Israel
from
the
river
of
Egypt
as
far
as
Lebo-hamath
to
bring
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
from
Kiriath-jearim
6
David
and
all
Israel
went
up
to
Baalah
to
Kiriath-jearim
which
belongs
to
Judah
to
bring
up
from
there
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
Jehovah
who
sits
enthroned
above
the
cherubs
where
his
name
is
called
on
7
However
they
placed
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
on
a
new
wagon
and
brought
it
from
the
house
of
Abinadab
and
Uzzah
and
Ahio
were
leading
the
wagon
8
David
and
all
Israel
were
celebrating
before
the
true
God
with
all
their
might
accompanied
by
songs
harps
other
stringed
instruments
tambourines
cymbals
and
trumpets
9
But
when
they
came
to
the
threshing
floor
of
Chidon
Uzzah
thrust
his
hand
out
and
grabbed
hold
of
the
Ark
for
the
cattle
nearly
upset
it
10
At
that
Jehovahs
anger
blazed
against
Uzzah
and
He
struck
him
down
because
he
had
thrust
his
hand
out
to
the
Ark
and
he
died
there
before
God
11
But
David
became
angry
because
Jehovahs
wrath
had
broken
through
against
Uzzah
and
that
place
has
been
called
Perez-uzzah
down
to
this
day
12
So
David
became
fearful
of
the
true
God
on
that
day
and
said
How
can
I
bring
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
to
me
13
David
did
not
bring
the
Ark
to
where
he
was
in
the
City
of
David
but
he
had
it
taken
to
the
house
of
Obed-edom
the
Gittite
14
The
Ark
of
the
true
God
was
with
the
household
of
Obed-edom
remaining
at
his
house
for
three
months
and
Jehovah
kept
blessing
the
household
of
Obed-edom
and
all
he
had
1
King
Hiram
of
Tyre
sent
messengers
to
David
along
with
cedar
timbers
stonemasons
and
woodworkers
to
build
a
house
for
him
2
And
David
knew
that
Jehovah
had
firmly
established
him
as
king
over
Israel
for
his
kingship
was
highly
exalted
for
the
sake
of
His
people
Israel
3
David
took
more
wives
in
Jerusalem
and
David
became
father
to
more
sons
and
daughters
4
These
are
the
names
of
the
children
born
to
him
in
Jerusalem
Shammua
Shobab
Nathan
Solomon
5
Ibhar
Elishua
Elpelet
6
Nogah
Nepheg
Japhia
7
Elishama
Beeliada
and
Eliphelet
8
When
the
Philistines
heard
that
David
had
been
anointed
as
king
over
all
Israel
all
the
Philistines
came
up
to
search
for
David
When
David
heard
about
it
he
went
out
against
them
9
Then
the
Philistines
came
in
and
kept
making
raids
in
the
Valley
of
Rephaim
10
David
inquired
of
God
saying
Should
I
go
up
against
the
Philistines
Will
you
give
them
into
my
hand
At
this
Jehovah
said
to
him
Go
up
and
I
will
surely
give
them
into
your
hand
11
So
David
went
up
to
Baal-perazim
and
he
struck
them
down
there
At
that
David
said
The
true
God
has
broken
through
my
enemies
by
my
hand
like
a
breach
made
by
waters
That
is
why
they
named
that
place
Baal-perazim
12
The
Philistines
abandoned
their
gods
there
and
when
David
gave
the
order
these
were
burned
in
the
fire
13
Later
the
Philistines
once
again
made
a
raid
in
the
valley
14
David
again
inquired
of
God
but
the
true
God
said
to
him
Do
not
go
directly
up
after
them
Instead
go
around
behind
them
and
come
against
them
in
front
of
the
baca
bushes
15
And
when
you
hear
the
sound
of
marching
in
the
tops
of
the
baca
bushes
launch
your
attack
for
the
true
God
will
have
gone
out
before
you
to
strike
down
the
army
of
the
Philistines
16
So
David
did
just
as
the
true
God
commanded
him
and
they
struck
down
the
Philistine
army
from
Gibeon
to
Gezer
17
And
Davids
fame
spread
into
all
the
lands
and
Jehovah
put
the
dread
of
him
upon
all
the
nations
1
And
he
continued
building
houses
for
himself
in
the
City
of
David
and
he
prepared
a
place
for
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
and
pitched
a
tent
for
it
2
It
was
then
that
David
said
No
one
is
to
carry
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
except
the
Levites
for
Jehovah
has
chosen
them
to
carry
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
and
to
minister
to
him
always
3
Then
David
congregated
all
Israel
at
Jerusalem
to
bring
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
up
to
the
place
that
he
had
prepared
for
it
4
David
gathered
the
descendants
of
Aaron
and
the
Levites
5
from
the
Kohathites
Uriel
the
chief
and
120
of
his
brothers
6
from
the
Merarites
Asaiah
the
chief
and
220
of
his
brothers
7
from
the
Gershomites
Joel
the
chief
and
130
of
his
brothers
8
from
the
descendants
of
Elizaphan
Shemaiah
the
chief
and
200
of
his
brothers
9
from
the
descendants
of
Hebron
Eliel
the
chief
and
80
of
his
brothers
10
from
the
descendants
of
Uzziel
Amminadab
the
chief
and
112
of
his
brothers
11
Furthermore
David
called
the
priests
Zadok
and
Abiathar
and
the
Levites
Uriel
Asaiah
Joel
Shemaiah
Eliel
and
Amminadab
12
and
he
said
to
them
You
are
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
Levites
Sanctify
yourselves
you
and
your
brothers
and
bring
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
up
to
the
place
that
I
have
prepared
for
it
13
Since
you
did
not
carry
it
the
first
time
the
anger
of
Jehovah
our
God
broke
out
against
us
because
we
did
not
search
out
the
proper
procedure
14
So
the
priests
and
the
Levites
sanctified
themselves
to
bring
up
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
15
Then
the
Levites
carried
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
on
their
shoulders
with
the
poles
just
as
Moses
had
commanded
by
Jehovahs
word
16
David
then
told
the
chiefs
of
the
Levites
to
appoint
their
brothers
the
singers
to
sing
out
joyfully
accompanied
by
musical
instruments
stringed
instruments
harps
and
cymbals
17
So
the
Levites
appointed
Heman
the
son
of
Joel
and
of
his
brothers
Asaph
the
son
of
Berechiah
and
of
the
Merarites
their
brothers
Ethan
the
son
of
Kushaiah
18
Together
with
them
were
their
brothers
of
the
second
division
Zechariah
Ben
Jaaziel
Shemiramoth
Jehiel
Unni
Eliab
Benaiah
Maaseiah
Mattithiah
Eliphelehu
and
Mikneiah
and
Obed-edom
and
Jeiel
the
gatekeepers
19
The
singers
Heman
Asaph
and
Ethan
were
to
play
the
copper
cymbals
20
and
Zechariah
Aziel
Shemiramoth
Jehiel
Unni
Eliab
Maaseiah
and
Benaiah
played
stringed
instruments
tuned
to
Alamoth
21
and
Mattithiah
Eliphelehu
Mikneiah
Obed-edom
Jeiel
and
Azaziah
played
harps
tuned
to
Sheminith
to
act
as
directors
22
Chenaniah
the
chief
of
the
Levites
supervised
the
transport
for
he
was
an
expert
23
and
Berechiah
and
Elkanah
were
gatekeepers
for
the
Ark
24
The
priests
Shebaniah
Joshaphat
Nethanel
Amasai
Zechariah
Benaiah
and
Eliezer
loudly
sounded
the
trumpets
before
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
and
Obed-edom
and
Jehiah
also
served
as
gatekeepers
for
the
Ark
25
Then
David
and
the
elders
of
Israel
and
the
chiefs
of
the
thousands
were
walking
along
to
bring
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
up
from
the
house
of
Obed-edom
with
rejoicing
26
When
the
true
God
helped
the
Levites
who
were
carrying
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
they
sacrificed
seven
young
bulls
and
seven
rams
27
David
was
dressed
in
a
sleeveless
coat
of
fine
fabric
as
were
all
the
Levites
carrying
the
Ark
the
singers
and
Chenaniah
the
chief
of
the
transport
and
the
singers
David
was
also
wearing
a
linen
ephod
28
All
the
Israelites
were
bringing
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
with
joyful
shouting
with
the
sound
of
the
horn
with
trumpets
with
cymbals
playing
loudly
on
stringed
instruments
and
harps
29
But
when
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
came
to
the
City
of
David
Sauls
daughter
Michal
looked
down
through
the
window
and
saw
King
David
skipping
about
and
celebrating
and
she
began
to
despise
him
in
her
heart
1
So
they
brought
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
in
and
placed
it
inside
the
tent
that
David
had
pitched
for
it
and
they
presented
burnt
offerings
and
communion
sacrifices
before
the
true
God
2
When
David
finished
offering
up
the
burnt
offerings
and
the
communion
sacrifices
he
blessed
the
people
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
3
Further
he
distributed
to
all
the
Israelites
to
each
man
and
woman
a
round
loaf
of
bread
a
date
cake
and
a
raisin
cake
4
Then
he
appointed
some
of
the
Levites
to
minister
before
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
to
honor
thank
and
praise
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
5
Asaph
was
the
head
and
second
to
him
was
Zechariah
and
Jeiel
Shemiramoth
Jehiel
Mattithiah
Eliab
Benaiah
Obed-edom
and
Jeiel
played
stringed
instruments
and
harps
and
Asaph
played
the
cymbals
6
and
Benaiah
and
Jahaziel
the
priests
blew
the
trumpets
constantly
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
true
God
7
It
was
on
that
day
that
David
first
contributed
a
song
of
thanks
to
Jehovah
through
Asaph
and
his
brothers
8
Give
thanks
to
Jehovah
call
on
his
name
Make
his
deeds
known
among
the
peoples
9
Sing
to
him
sing
praises
to
him
Ponder
over
all
his
wonderful
works
10
Boast
about
his
holy
name
Let
the
hearts
of
those
seeking
Jehovah
rejoice
11
Search
for
Jehovah
and
his
strength
Seek
his
face
constantly
12
Remember
the
wonderful
works
he
has
performed
His
miracles
and
the
judgments
he
has
pronounced
13
You
offspring
of
Israel
his
servant
You
sons
of
Jacob
his
chosen
ones
14
He
is
Jehovah
our
God
His
judgments
are
throughout
the
earth
15
Remember
his
covenant
forever
The
promise
he
made
to
a
thousand
generations
16
The
covenant
he
made
with
Abraham
And
the
oath
he
swore
to
Isaac
17
Which
he
established
as
a
decree
to
JacobAnd
as
a
lasting
covenant
to
Israel
18
Saying
I
will
give
you
the
land
of
CanaanAs
your
allotted
inheritance
19
This
was
when
you
were
few
in
number
Yes
very
few
and
you
were
foreigners
in
the
land
20
They
walked
about
from
nation
to
nation
From
one
kingdom
to
another
people
21
He
did
not
allow
any
man
to
oppress
them
But
on
their
account
he
reproved
kings
22
Saying
Do
not
touch
my
anointed
ones
And
to
my
prophets
do
nothing
bad
23
Sing
to
Jehovah
all
the
earth
Announce
his
salvation
day
after
day
24
Declare
his
glory
among
the
nations
His
wonderful
works
among
all
the
peoples
25
For
Jehovah
is
great
and
most
worthy
of
praise
He
is
more
awe-inspiring
than
all
other
gods
26
All
the
gods
of
the
peoples
are
worthless
gods
But
Jehovah
is
the
one
who
made
the
heavens
27
In
his
presence
are
majesty
and
splendor
Strength
and
joy
are
in
his
dwelling
place
28
Give
Jehovah
his
due
you
families
of
the
peoples
Give
Jehovah
his
due
for
his
glory
and
strength
29
Give
Jehovah
the
glory
due
his
name
Bring
a
gift
and
come
in
before
him
Bow
down
to
Jehovah
in
holy
adornment
30
Tremble
before
him
all
the
earth
The
earth
is
firmly
established
it
cannot
be
moved
31
Let
the
heavens
rejoice
and
let
the
earth
be
joyful
Declare
among
the
nations
Jehovah
has
become
King
32
Let
the
sea
thunder
and
all
that
fills
it
Let
the
fields
and
everything
in
them
rejoice
33
At
the
same
time
let
the
trees
of
the
forest
shout
joyfully
before
Jehovah
For
he
is
coming
to
judge
the
earth
34
Give
thanks
to
Jehovah
for
he
is
good
His
loyal
love
endures
forever
35
And
say
Save
us
O
God
of
our
salvation
Gather
us
and
rescue
us
from
the
nations
So
that
we
may
give
thanks
to
your
holy
nameAnd
exult
in
praising
you
36
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
be
praisedThroughout
all
eternity
And
all
the
people
said
Amen
and
they
praised
Jehovah
37
Then
David
left
Asaph
and
his
brothers
there
before
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
to
minister
continually
before
the
Ark
according
to
the
daily
routine
38
Obed-edom
and
his
brothers
numbering
68
and
Obed-edom
the
son
of
Jeduthun
and
Hosah
were
gatekeepers
39
and
Zadok
the
priest
and
his
fellow
priests
were
before
the
tabernacle
of
Jehovah
on
the
high
place
at
Gibeon
40
to
offer
up
burnt
offerings
to
Jehovah
regularly
on
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
morning
and
evening
and
to
do
all
that
is
written
in
the
Law
of
Jehovah
that
he
commanded
Israel
41
With
them
were
Heman
and
Jeduthun
and
the
rest
of
the
selected
men
who
were
designated
by
their
names
to
thank
Jehovah
because
his
loyal
love
endures
forever
42
and
with
them
were
Heman
and
Jeduthun
to
sound
the
trumpets
cymbals
and
the
instruments
used
to
praise
the
true
God
and
the
sons
of
Jeduthun
were
at
the
gate
43
Then
all
the
people
went
to
their
homes
and
David
went
to
bless
his
own
household
1
As
soon
as
David
was
settled
in
his
own
house
he
said
to
Nathan
the
prophet
Here
I
am
living
in
a
house
of
cedars
while
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
is
under
tent
cloths
2
Nathan
replied
to
David
Do
whatever
is
in
your
heart
for
the
true
God
is
with
you
3
On
that
very
night
the
word
of
God
came
to
Nathan
saying
4
Go
and
say
to
my
servant
David
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
are
not
the
one
who
will
build
the
house
for
me
to
dwell
in
5
For
I
have
not
dwelled
in
a
house
from
the
day
I
brought
Israel
out
to
this
day
but
I
continued
going
from
tent
to
tent
and
from
one
tabernacle
to
another
6
During
all
the
time
that
I
went
with
all
Israel
did
I
ever
say
one
word
to
any
of
the
judges
of
Israel
whom
I
appointed
to
shepherd
my
people
saying
Why
did
you
not
build
a
house
of
cedars
for
me
7
Now
say
this
to
my
servant
David
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
I
took
you
from
the
pastures
from
following
the
flock
to
become
a
leader
over
my
people
Israel
8
And
I
will
be
with
you
wherever
you
go
and
I
will
do
away
with
all
your
enemies
from
before
you
and
I
will
make
a
name
for
you
like
the
name
of
the
great
men
of
the
earth
9
I
will
appoint
a
place
for
my
people
Israel
and
settle
them
and
they
will
live
there
and
not
be
disturbed
anymore
and
wicked
men
will
not
oppress
them
again
as
they
did
in
the
past
10
from
the
day
that
I
appointed
judges
over
my
people
Israel
And
I
will
subdue
all
your
enemies
Moreover
I
tell
you
Jehovah
will
build
a
house
for
you
11
When
your
days
come
to
an
end
and
you
go
to
be
with
your
forefathers
I
will
raise
up
your
offspring
after
you
one
of
your
sons
and
I
will
firmly
establish
his
kingship
12
He
is
the
one
who
will
build
a
house
for
me
and
I
will
firmly
establish
his
throne
forever
13
I
will
become
his
father
and
he
will
become
my
son
I
will
not
remove
my
loyal
love
from
him
the
way
I
removed
it
from
the
one
who
was
prior
to
you
14
I
will
cause
him
to
stand
in
my
house
and
in
my
kingship
forever
and
his
throne
will
last
forever
15
Nathan
told
David
all
these
words
and
this
entire
vision
16
At
that
King
David
came
in
and
sat
down
before
Jehovah
and
said
Who
am
I
O
Jehovah
God
And
what
is
my
house
that
you
have
brought
me
this
far
17
As
if
this
were
not
enough
O
God
you
also
speak
about
the
house
of
your
servant
down
to
a
distant
future
time
and
you
have
looked
on
me
as
if
I
were
a
man
who
should
be
further
exalted
O
Jehovah
God
18
What
more
can
your
servant
David
say
to
you
about
the
honor
given
me
when
you
know
your
servant
so
well
19
O
Jehovah
for
the
sake
of
your
servant
and
in
agreement
with
your
heart
you
have
done
all
these
great
things
by
revealing
your
greatness
20
O
Jehovah
there
is
no
one
like
you
and
there
is
no
God
except
you
everything
we
have
heard
with
our
ears
confirms
this
21
And
what
other
nation
on
earth
is
like
your
people
Israel
The
true
God
went
and
redeemed
them
as
his
people
You
made
a
name
for
yourself
by
your
great
and
awe-inspiring
deeds
driving
out
nations
from
before
your
people
whom
you
redeemed
from
Egypt
22
You
made
your
people
Israel
your
own
people
for
all
time
and
you
O
Jehovah
became
their
God
23
Now
O
Jehovah
may
the
promise
you
have
made
concerning
your
servant
and
his
house
prove
faithful
for
all
time
and
may
you
do
just
as
you
have
promised
24
May
your
name
endure
and
be
exalted
forever
so
that
people
may
say
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
is
God
to
Israel

and
may
the
house
of
your
servant
David
be
firmly
established
before
you
25
For
you
my
God
have
revealed
to
your
servant
your
purpose
to
build
him
a
house
That
is
why
your
servant
has
the
confidence
to
offer
this
prayer
to
you
26
And
now
O
Jehovah
you
are
the
true
God
and
you
have
promised
these
good
things
concerning
your
servant
27
So
may
it
please
you
to
bless
the
house
of
your
servant
and
may
it
continue
forever
before
you
for
you
O
Jehovah
have
blessed
and
it
is
blessed
forever
1
Some
time
later
David
defeated
the
Philistines
and
subdued
them
and
took
Gath
and
its
dependent
towns
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Philistines
2
Then
he
defeated
Moab
and
the
Moabites
became
Davids
servants
and
brought
tribute
3
David
defeated
King
Hadadezer
of
Zobah
near
Hamath
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
establish
his
authority
at
the
Euphrates
River
4
David
captured
1000
chariots
7000
horsemen
and
20000
foot
soldiers
from
him
Then
David
hamstrung
all
but
100
of
the
chariot
horses
5
When
the
Syrians
of
Damascus
came
to
help
King
Hadadezer
of
Zobah
David
struck
down
22000
of
the
Syrians
6
David
then
established
garrisons
in
Syria
of
Damascus
and
the
Syrians
became
Davids
servants
and
brought
tribute
Jehovah
gave
David
victory
wherever
he
went
7
Moreover
David
took
the
circular
shields
of
gold
from
the
servants
of
Hadadezer
and
brought
them
to
Jerusalem
8
From
Tibhath
and
Cun
cities
of
Hadadezer
David
took
a
great
quantity
of
copper
With
it
Solomon
made
the
copper
Sea
the
pillars
and
the
copper
utensils
9
When
King
Tou
of
Hamath
heard
that
David
had
defeated
the
entire
army
of
King
Hadadezer
of
Zobah
10
he
immediately
sent
his
son
Hadoram
to
King
David
to
ask
about
his
welfare
and
to
congratulate
him
because
he
had
fought
and
defeated
Hadadezer
for
Hadadezer
had
often
fought
against
Tou
and
he
brought
all
sorts
of
articles
of
gold
silver
and
copper
11
King
David
sanctified
these
to
Jehovah
along
with
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
he
had
carried
off
from
all
the
nations
from
Edom
and
Moab
from
the
Ammonites
the
Philistines
and
the
Amalekites
12
Abishai
the
son
of
Zeruiah
struck
down
18000
Edomites
in
the
Valley
of
Salt
13
He
established
garrisons
in
Edom
and
all
the
Edomites
became
Davids
servants
Jehovah
gave
David
victory
wherever
he
went
14
David
kept
reigning
over
all
Israel
and
he
was
administering
justice
and
righteousness
for
all
his
people
15
Joab
the
son
of
Zeruiah
was
over
the
army
Jehoshaphat
the
son
of
Ahilud
was
recorder
16
Zadok
the
son
of
Ahitub
and
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Abiathar
were
priests
and
Shavsha
was
secretary
17
Benaiah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
was
over
the
Cherethites
and
the
Pelethites
And
Davids
sons
were
first
in
position
next
to
the
king
1
Later
Nahash
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
died
and
his
son
became
king
in
his
place
2
At
that
David
said
I
will
show
loyal
love
toward
Hanun
the
son
of
Nahash
because
his
father
showed
loyal
love
toward
me
So
David
sent
messengers
to
offer
him
comfort
over
the
loss
of
his
father
But
when
Davids
servants
came
into
the
land
of
the
Ammonites
to
comfort
Hanun
3
the
princes
of
the
Ammonites
said
to
Hanun
Do
you
think
that
David
is
honoring
your
father
by
sending
comforters
to
you
Is
it
not
to
make
a
thorough
search
and
to
overthrow
you
and
to
spy
out
the
land
that
his
servants
have
come
to
you
4
So
Hanun
took
the
servants
of
David
and
shaved
them
and
cut
their
garments
in
half
at
their
buttocks
and
sent
them
away
5
When
David
was
told
about
the
men
he
at
once
sent
others
to
meet
them
because
the
men
had
been
deeply
humiliated
and
the
king
told
them
Stay
in
Jericho
until
your
beards
grow
back
and
then
return
6
In
time
the
Ammonites
saw
that
they
had
become
a
stench
to
David
so
Hanun
and
the
Ammonites
sent
1000
silver
talents
to
hire
chariots
and
horsemen
from
Mesopotamia
Aram-maacah
and
Zobah
7
Thus
they
hired
32000
chariots
along
with
the
king
of
Maacah
and
his
people
Then
they
came
and
camped
before
Medeba
The
Ammonites
gathered
together
from
their
cities
and
came
out
for
the
battle
8
When
David
heard
about
it
he
sent
Joab
and
the
entire
army
including
his
mightiest
warriors
9
And
the
Ammonites
went
out
and
drew
up
in
battle
formation
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
while
the
kings
who
had
come
were
by
themselves
in
the
open
field
10
When
Joab
saw
that
the
battle
charges
were
coming
against
him
from
the
front
and
the
rear
he
chose
some
of
the
best
troops
in
Israel
and
drew
them
up
in
battle
formation
to
meet
the
Syrians
11
He
put
the
rest
of
the
men
under
the
command
of
his
brother
Abishai
in
order
to
draw
them
up
in
battle
formation
to
meet
the
Ammonites
12
Then
he
said
If
the
Syrians
become
too
strong
for
me
then
you
must
come
to
my
rescue
but
if
the
Ammonites
become
too
strong
for
you
I
will
rescue
you
13
We
must
be
strong
and
courageous
for
our
people
and
for
the
cities
of
our
God
and
Jehovah
will
do
what
is
good
in
his
eyes
14
Then
Joab
and
his
men
advanced
to
meet
the
Syrians
in
battle
and
they
fled
from
before
him
15
When
the
Ammonites
saw
that
the
Syrians
had
fled
they
also
fled
from
his
brother
Abishai
and
went
into
the
city
After
that
Joab
came
to
Jerusalem
16
When
the
Syrians
saw
that
they
had
been
defeated
by
Israel
they
sent
messengers
to
summon
the
Syrians
in
the
region
of
the
River
with
Shophach
the
chief
of
the
army
of
Hadadezer
leading
them
17
When
the
report
was
made
to
David
he
immediately
gathered
all
Israel
and
crossed
the
Jordan
and
came
to
them
and
drew
up
in
battle
formation
against
them
David
drew
up
in
battle
formation
to
meet
the
Syrians
and
they
fought
against
him
18
But
the
Syrians
fled
from
Israel
and
David
killed
7000
charioteers
and
40000
foot
soldiers
of
the
Syrians
and
he
put
Shophach
the
chief
of
the
army
to
death
19
When
the
servants
of
Hadadezer
saw
that
they
had
been
defeated
by
Israel
they
promptly
made
peace
with
David
and
became
his
subjects
and
Syria
did
not
want
to
help
the
Ammonites
anymore
1
At
the
start
of
the
year
at
the
time
when
kings
go
on
campaigns
Joab
led
a
military
expedition
and
devastated
the
land
of
the
Ammonites
he
came
and
besieged
Rabbah
while
David
stayed
in
Jerusalem
Joab
attacked
Rabbah
and
tore
it
down
2
Then
David
took
the
crown
of
Malcam
from
its
head
and
found
that
it
weighed
a
talent
of
gold
and
in
it
there
were
precious
stones
and
it
was
placed
on
Davids
head
He
also
took
a
vast
amount
of
spoil
from
the
city
3
And
he
brought
out
the
people
who
were
in
it
and
put
them
to
work
at
sawing
stones
and
at
working
with
sharp
iron
instruments
and
with
axes
That
was
what
David
did
to
all
the
cities
of
the
Ammonites
Finally
David
and
all
the
troops
returned
to
Jerusalem
4
After
this
war
broke
out
at
Gezer
with
the
Philistines
At
that
time
Sibbecai
the
Hushathite
struck
down
Sippai
who
was
a
descendant
of
the
Rephaim
and
they
were
subdued
5
And
there
was
war
again
with
the
Philistines
and
Elhanan
the
son
of
Jair
struck
down
Lahmi
the
brother
of
Goliath
the
Gittite
whose
spear
had
a
shaft
like
the
beam
of
loom
workers
6
War
broke
out
yet
again
at
Gath
where
there
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
size
with
6
fingers
on
each
hand
and
6
toes
on
each
foot
24
in
all
and
he
too
was
a
descendant
of
the
Rephaim
7
He
kept
taunting
Israel
So
Jonathan
the
son
of
Shimea
Davids
brother
struck
him
down
8
These
were
descendants
of
the
Rephaim
in
Gath
and
they
fell
by
the
hand
of
David
and
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
1
Then
Satan
stood
up
against
Israel
and
incited
David
to
number
Israel
2
So
David
said
to
Joab
and
the
chiefs
of
the
people
Go
count
Israel
from
Beer-sheba
to
Dan
then
report
to
me
so
that
I
may
know
their
number
3
But
Joab
said
May
Jehovah
multiply
his
people
100
times
My
lord
the
king
are
not
all
of
them
already
servants
of
my
lord
Why
does
my
lord
want
to
do
this
Why
should
he
become
a
cause
of
guilt
to
Israel
4
But
the
kings
word
prevailed
over
Joab
So
Joab
went
out
and
traveled
throughout
Israel
after
which
he
came
to
Jerusalem
5
Joab
now
gave
to
David
the
number
of
the
people
who
were
registered
All
Israel
amounted
to
1100000
men
armed
with
swords
and
Judah
470000
men
armed
with
swords
6
But
Levi
and
Benjamin
were
not
registered
among
them
because
the
kings
word
was
detestable
to
Joab
7
Now
this
was
very
displeasing
to
the
true
God
so
he
struck
Israel
8
David
then
said
to
the
true
God
I
have
sinned
greatly
by
doing
this
And
now
please
forgive
your
servants
error
for
I
have
acted
very
foolishly
9
Jehovah
then
spoke
to
Gad
Davids
visionary
saying
10
Go
and
say
to
David
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
am
giving
you
three
options
Choose
the
one
that
I
should
bring
on
you
11
So
Gad
came
in
to
David
and
said
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Take
your
pick
12
whether
there
should
be
three
years
of
famine
or
three
months
of
being
swept
away
by
your
adversaries
while
the
sword
of
your
enemies
overtakes
you
or
three
days
of
the
sword
of
Jehovah—pestilence
in
the
land—with
Jehovahs
angel
bringing
destruction
in
all
the
territory
of
Israel
Now
consider
what
I
should
reply
to
the
One
who
sent
me
13
So
David
said
to
Gad
It
is
very
distressing
to
me
Please
let
me
fall
into
the
hand
of
Jehovah
for
his
mercy
is
very
great
but
do
not
let
me
fall
into
the
hand
of
man
14
Then
Jehovah
sent
a
pestilence
on
Israel
so
that
70000
people
out
of
Israel
fell
15
Moreover
the
true
God
sent
an
angel
to
Jerusalem
to
destroy
it
but
as
he
was
about
to
do
so
Jehovah
saw
it
and
felt
regret
over
the
calamity
and
he
said
to
the
angel
bringing
destruction
It
is
enough
Now
let
your
hand
drop
Jehovahs
angel
was
standing
close
to
the
threshing
floor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite
16
When
David
raised
his
eyes
he
saw
Jehovahs
angel
standing
between
the
earth
and
the
heavens
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
extended
toward
Jerusalem
David
and
the
elders
covered
with
sackcloth
at
once
threw
themselves
down
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
17
David
said
to
the
true
God
Was
it
not
I
who
said
to
number
the
people
I
am
the
one
who
sinned
and
I
am
the
one
who
did
wrong
but
these
sheep—what
have
they
done
O
Jehovah
my
God
let
your
hand
please
come
against
me
and
my
fathers
house
but
do
not
bring
this
scourge
on
your
people
18
Jehovahs
angel
then
told
Gad
to
tell
David
to
go
up
and
erect
an
altar
to
Jehovah
on
the
threshing
floor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite
19
So
David
went
up
at
the
word
of
Gad
which
he
had
spoken
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
20
Meanwhile
Ornan
turned
around
and
saw
the
angel
and
his
four
sons
who
were
with
him
hid
themselves
Now
Ornan
had
been
threshing
wheat
21
When
David
came
up
to
him
Ornan
looked
and
saw
David
and
he
immediately
went
out
from
the
threshing
floor
and
bowed
down
to
David
with
his
face
to
the
ground
22
David
said
to
Ornan
Sell
me
the
site
of
the
threshing
floor
so
that
I
may
build
an
altar
to
Jehovah
on
it
Sell
it
to
me
for
the
full
price
so
that
the
scourge
against
the
people
may
be
halted
23
But
Ornan
said
to
David
Take
it
as
your
own
and
let
my
lord
the
king
do
what
seems
good
to
him
Here
I
am
providing
the
cattle
for
burnt
offerings
and
the
threshing
sledge
for
the
wood
and
the
wheat
as
a
grain
offering
I
give
all
of
it
24
However
King
David
said
to
Ornan
No
I
must
buy
it
for
the
full
price
because
I
will
not
take
what
is
yours
and
give
it
to
Jehovah
or
offer
up
burnt
sacrifices
that
cost
me
nothing
25
So
David
gave
Ornan
600
gold
shekels
by
weight
for
the
site
26
And
David
built
an
altar
there
to
Jehovah
and
offered
up
burnt
sacrifices
and
communion
sacrifices
and
he
called
on
Jehovah
who
now
answered
him
with
fire
from
the
heavens
on
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
27
Then
Jehovah
ordered
the
angel
to
return
his
sword
to
its
sheath
28
At
that
time
when
David
saw
that
Jehovah
had
answered
him
at
the
threshing
floor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite
he
continued
to
sacrifice
there
29
However
the
tabernacle
of
Jehovah
that
Moses
had
made
in
the
wilderness
and
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
were
at
that
time
on
the
high
place
at
Gibeon
30
But
David
had
not
been
able
to
go
before
it
to
consult
God
for
he
was
terrified
because
of
the
sword
of
Jehovahs
angel
1
David
then
said
This
is
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
true
God
and
this
is
an
altar
for
burnt
offering
for
Israel
2
David
then
gave
orders
to
bring
together
the
foreign
residents
who
were
in
the
land
of
Israel
and
he
assigned
them
to
be
stonecutters
to
cut
and
shape
stones
for
building
the
house
of
the
true
God
3
David
also
prepared
iron
in
great
quantity
for
nails
for
the
doors
of
the
gates
and
for
clamps
and
so
much
copper
that
it
was
beyond
weighing
4
and
also
cedar
timbers
without
number
for
the
Sidonians
and
the
Tyrians
brought
great
quantities
of
cedar
timbers
to
David
5
And
David
said
My
son
Solomon
is
young
and
inexperienced
and
the
house
to
be
built
for
Jehovah
is
to
be
exceedingly
magnificent
so
that
its
fame
and
beauty
will
be
known
in
all
lands
Therefore
I
will
make
preparation
for
him
So
David
prepared
materials
in
great
quantity
before
his
death
6
Moreover
he
summoned
his
son
Solomon
and
instructed
him
to
build
a
house
for
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
7
David
told
his
son
Solomon
As
for
me
it
was
my
hearts
desire
to
build
a
house
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
my
God
8
But
Jehovahs
word
came
to
me
saying
You
have
shed
a
great
deal
of
blood
and
you
have
fought
great
wars
You
will
not
build
a
house
for
my
name
for
you
have
shed
a
great
deal
of
blood
on
the
earth
before
me
9
Look
You
will
have
a
son
who
will
be
a
man
of
peace
and
I
will
give
him
rest
from
all
his
enemies
who
surround
him
for
Solomon
will
be
his
name
and
I
will
grant
Israel
peace
and
quiet
in
his
days
10
He
is
the
one
who
will
build
a
house
for
my
name
He
will
become
my
son
and
I
will
be
his
father
I
will
firmly
establish
the
throne
of
his
kingship
over
Israel
forever
11
Now
my
son
may
Jehovah
be
with
you
and
may
you
be
successful
and
build
the
house
of
Jehovah
your
God
just
as
he
has
spoken
concerning
you
12
Only
may
Jehovah
give
you
discretion
and
understanding
when
he
gives
you
authority
over
Israel
so
that
you
may
keep
the
law
of
Jehovah
your
God
13
Then
you
will
be
successful
if
you
carefully
observe
the
regulations
and
the
judgments
that
Jehovah
ordered
Moses
to
give
Israel
Be
courageous
and
strong
Do
not
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
14
Here
I
have
taken
great
pains
to
prepare
for
Jehovahs
house
100000
talents
of
gold
and
1000000
talents
of
silver
and
such
great
quantities
of
copper
and
iron
that
they
cannot
be
weighed
and
I
have
prepared
timbers
and
stones
but
you
will
add
to
them
15
A
great
number
of
workmen
are
with
you—stonecutters
stonemasons
woodworkers
and
all
kinds
of
skilled
workers
16
The
gold
silver
copper
and
iron
are
beyond
measure
Get
up
and
begin
the
work
and
may
Jehovah
be
with
you
17
David
then
ordered
all
the
princes
of
Israel
to
help
his
son
Solomon
18
Is
not
Jehovah
your
God
with
you
and
has
he
not
given
you
rest
on
every
side
For
he
handed
over
to
me
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
and
the
land
has
been
subdued
before
Jehovah
and
before
his
people
19
Now
determine
with
all
your
heart
and
soul
to
seek
Jehovah
your
God
and
start
building
the
sanctuary
of
Jehovah
the
true
God
in
order
to
bring
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
and
the
holy
utensils
of
the
true
God
to
the
house
built
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
1
When
David
had
grown
old
and
was
near
the
end
of
his
life
he
made
his
son
Solomon
king
over
Israel
2
He
then
gathered
all
the
princes
of
Israel
the
priests
and
the
Levites
3
The
Levites
who
were
30
years
old
and
up
were
numbered
their
number
their
head
count
man
by
man
was
38000
4
Of
these
24000
served
as
supervisors
over
the
work
of
Jehovahs
house
and
there
were
6000
officers
and
judges
5
and
there
were
4000
gatekeepers
and
4000
gave
praise
to
Jehovah
on
the
instruments
about
which
David
said
I
made
them
for
giving
praise
6
Then
David
organized
them
into
divisions
according
to
the
sons
of
Levi
Gershon
Kohath
and
Merari
7
Of
the
Gershonites
were
Ladan
and
Shimei
8
The
sons
of
Ladan
were
Jehiel
the
headman
Zetham
and
Joel
three
9
The
sons
of
Shimei
were
Shelomoth
Haziel
and
Haran
three
These
were
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
for
Ladan
10
And
the
sons
of
Shimei
were
Jahath
Zina
Jeush
and
Beriah
These
four
were
the
sons
of
Shimei
11
Jahath
was
the
head
and
Zizah
the
second
But
since
Jeush
and
Beriah
did
not
have
many
sons
they
were
counted
as
one
paternal
house
with
one
area
of
responsibility
12
The
sons
of
Kohath
were
Amram
Izhar
Hebron
and
Uzziel
four
13
The
sons
of
Amram
were
Aaron
and
Moses
But
Aaron
was
permanently
set
apart
to
sanctify
the
Most
Holy
he
and
his
sons
to
offer
sacrifices
before
Jehovah
to
minister
to
him
and
to
pronounce
blessings
in
his
name
always
14
As
for
Moses
the
man
of
the
true
God
his
sons
were
named
among
the
tribe
of
the
Levites
15
The
sons
of
Moses
were
Gershom
and
Eliezer
16
Of
the
sons
of
Gershom
Shebuel
was
the
head
17
Of
the
descendants
of
Eliezer
Rehabiah
was
the
head
Eliezer
did
not
have
other
sons
but
the
sons
of
Rehabiah
were
very
many
18
Of
the
sons
of
Izhar
Shelomith
was
the
headman
19
The
sons
of
Hebron
were
Jeriah
the
head
Amariah
the
second
Jahaziel
the
third
and
Jekameam
the
fourth
20
The
sons
of
Uzziel
were
Micah
the
head
and
Isshiah
the
second
21
The
sons
of
Merari
were
Mahli
and
Mushi
The
sons
of
Mahli
were
Eleazar
and
Kish
22
Eleazar
died
but
he
had
no
sons
only
daughters
So
the
sons
of
Kish
their
relatives
took
them
as
wives
23
The
sons
of
Mushi
were
Mahli
Eder
and
Jeremoth
three
24
These
were
the
sons
of
Levi
according
to
their
paternal
houses
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
by
those
registered
who
were
counted
and
listed
by
their
names
and
who
carried
out
the
work
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
from
20
years
old
and
up
25
For
David
had
said
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
has
given
rest
to
his
people
and
he
will
reside
in
Jerusalem
forever
26
Also
the
Levites
will
not
have
to
carry
the
tabernacle
or
any
of
its
utensils
for
its
service
27
For
according
to
the
last
instructions
of
David
the
Levites
from
20
years
old
and
up
were
numbered
28
Their
function
was
to
assist
the
sons
of
Aaron
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
to
be
in
charge
of
the
courtyards
the
dining
rooms
the
purification
of
every
holy
thing
and
any
work
needed
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
29
They
assisted
with
the
layer
bread
the
fine
flour
for
the
grain
offering
the
wafers
of
unleavened
bread
the
griddle
cakes
the
mixed
dough
and
all
measures
of
quantity
and
size
30
They
were
to
stand
morning
by
morning
to
thank
and
praise
Jehovah
and
likewise
in
the
evening
31
They
assisted
whenever
the
burnt
sacrifices
were
offered
to
Jehovah
on
the
Sabbaths
the
new
moons
and
during
the
festival
seasons
according
to
the
number
required
by
the
rules
concerning
them
doing
so
regularly
before
Jehovah
32
They
also
took
care
of
their
responsibilities
toward
the
tent
of
meeting
toward
the
holy
place
and
toward
their
brothers
the
sons
of
Aaron
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
1
Now
the
divisions
of
the
descendants
of
Aaron
were
these
The
sons
of
Aaron
were
Nadab
Abihu
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
2
However
Nadab
and
Abihu
died
before
their
father
and
they
did
not
have
any
sons
but
Eleazar
and
Ithamar
continued
to
serve
as
priests
3
David
along
with
Zadok
from
the
sons
of
Eleazar
and
Ahimelech
from
the
sons
of
Ithamar
made
divisions
of
them
for
the
office
of
their
service
4
Since
the
sons
of
Eleazar
had
more
headmen
than
the
sons
of
Ithamar
had
they
divided
them
accordingly
The
sons
of
Eleazar
had
16
as
heads
of
their
paternal
houses
and
the
sons
of
Ithamar
had
8
as
heads
of
their
paternal
houses
5
Further
they
divided
them
by
lots
the
one
group
along
with
the
other
for
there
were
chiefs
of
the
holy
place
and
chiefs
of
the
true
God
from
both
the
sons
of
Eleazar
and
the
sons
of
Ithamar
6
Then
Shemaiah
the
son
of
Nethanel
the
secretary
of
the
Levites
recorded
their
names
before
the
king
the
princes
Zadok
the
priest
Ahimelech
the
son
of
Abiathar
and
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
the
priests
and
of
the
Levites
one
paternal
house
being
selected
for
Eleazar
and
one
being
selected
for
Ithamar
7
The
first
lot
came
out
to
Jehoiarib
the
second
to
Jedaiah
8
the
third
to
Harim
the
fourth
to
Seorim
9
the
fifth
to
Malchijah
the
sixth
to
Mijamin
10
the
seventh
to
Hakkoz
the
eighth
to
Abijah
11
the
ninth
to
Jeshua
the
tenth
to
Shecaniah
12
the
11th
to
Eliashib
the
12th
to
Jakim
13
the
13th
to
Huppah
the
14th
to
Jeshebeab

brothers
and
my
people
It
was
my
hearts
desire
to
build
a
house
as
the
resting-place
for
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
and
as
the
footstool
of
our
God
and
I
made
preparations
to
build
3
But
the
true
God
told
me
You
will
not
build
a
house
for
my
name
for
you
are
a
man
of
wars
and
you
have
shed
blood
4
However
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
chose
me
out
of
all
the
house
of
my
father
to
become
king
over
Israel
forever
for
he
chose
Judah
as
leader
and
of
the
house
of
Judah
my
fathers
house
and
of
my
fathers
sons
I
was
the
one
whom
he
approved
to
make
me
king
over
all
Israel
5
And
of
all
my
sons—for
Jehovah
has
given
me
many
sons—he
chose
my
son
Solomon
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
the
kingship
of
Jehovah
over
Israel
6
He
said
to
me
Your
son
Solomon
is
the
one
who
will
build
my
house
and
my
courtyards
for
I
have
chosen
him
as
my
son
and
I
will
become
his
father
7
I
will
firmly
establish
his
kingship
forever
if
he
resolutely
observes
my
commandments
and
my
judicial
decisions
as
he
is
now
doing
8
So
I
say
before
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
Jehovahs
congregation
and
in
the
ears
of
our
God
Carefully
observe
and
search
for
all
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
your
God
so
that
you
may
possess
the
good
land
and
pass
it
on
as
a
permanent
inheritance
to
your
sons
after
you
9
And
you
Solomon
my
son
know
the
God
of
your
father
and
serve
him
with
a
complete
heart
and
with
a
delightful
soul
for
Jehovah
searches
through
all
hearts
and
he
discerns
every
inclination
of
the
thoughts
If
you
search
for
him
he
will
let
himself
be
found
by
you
but
if
you
leave
him
he
will
reject
you
forever
10
See
now
for
Jehovah
has
chosen
you
to
build
a
house
as
a
sanctuary
Be
courageous
and
go
to
work
11
David
then
gave
to
his
son
Solomon
the
architectural
plan
of
the
porch
and
of
its
houses
its
storerooms
its
roof
chambers
its
inner
rooms
and
the
house
of
the
propitiatory
cover
12
He
gave
him
the
architectural
plan
of
everything
that
had
been
conveyed
to
him
through
inspiration
for
the
courtyards
of
Jehovahs
house
for
all
the
dining
rooms
around
it
for
the
treasuries
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
and
for
the
treasuries
of
the
things
made
holy
13
also
for
the
divisions
of
the
priests
and
of
the
Levites
for
all
the
duties
of
the
service
of
Jehovahs
house
and
for
all
the
utensils
of
the
service
of
Jehovahs
house
14
also
for
the
weight
of
the
gold
the
gold
for
all
the
utensils
for
the
different
services
the
weight
of
all
the
utensils
of
silver
and
for
all
the
utensils
for
the
different
services
15
also
the
weight
for
the
gold
lampstands
and
their
gold
lamps
the
weight
of
the
different
lampstands
and
their
lamps
and
the
weight
of
the
silver
lampstands
for
each
lampstand
and
its
lamps
according
to
its
use
16
also
the
weight
of
the
gold
for
the
tables
of
the
layer
bread
for
each
table
as
well
as
the
silver
for
the
tables
of
silver
17
for
the
forks
the
bowls
the
pitchers
of
pure
gold
and
the
weight
of
the
small
gold
bowls
for
each
small
bowl
and
the
weight
of
the
small
silver
bowls
for
each
small
bowl
18
He
also
gave
the
weight
for
the
refined
gold
for
the
incense
altar
and
for
the
representation
of
the
chariot
namely
the
cherubs
of
gold
that
spread
their
wings
out
and
overshadow
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
19
David
said
The
hand
of
Jehovah
was
upon
me
and
he
gave
me
insight
to
put
all
the
details
of
the
architectural
plan
in
writing
20
Then
David
said
to
his
son
Solomon
Be
courageous
and
strong
and
go
to
work
Do
not
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
for
Jehovah
God
my
God
is
with
you
He
will
not
desert
you
or
abandon
you
but
he
will
be
with
you
until
all
the
work
for
the
service
of
Jehovahs
house
is
finished
21
And
here
are
the
divisions
of
the
priests
and
of
the
Levites
for
all
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
You
have
willing
skilled
workers
to
perform
every
kind
of
service
as
well
as
the
princes
and
all
the
people
who
will
carry
out
all
your
instructions
1
King
David
now
said
to
all
the
congregation
My
son
Solomon
the
one
whom
God
has
chosen
is
young
and
inexperienced
and
the
work
is
great
for
it
is
not
a
temple
for
man
but
for
Jehovah
God
2
And
I
have
spared
no
effort
to
prepare
for
the
house
of
my
God
providing
the
gold
for
the
goldwork
the
silver
for
the
silverwork
the
copper
for
the
copperwork
the
iron
for
the
ironwork
the
timbers
for
the
timberwork
onyx
stones
and
stones
to
be
set
with
mortar
mosaic
pebbles
every
kind
of
precious
stone
and
alabaster
stones
in
great
quantity
3
Moreover
because
of
my
delight
in
the
house
of
my
God
there
is
also
my
private
treasure
of
gold
and
silver
that
I
am
giving
to
the
house
of
my
God
in
addition
to
all
that
I
have
prepared
for
the
holy
house
4
including
3000
talents
of
gold
from
Ophir
and
7000
talents
of
refined
silver
for
coating
the
walls
of
the
houses
5
the
gold
for
the
goldwork
and
the
silver
for
the
silverwork
and
for
all
the
work
to
be
done
by
the
craftsmen
Now
who
volunteers
to
come
forward
today
with
a
gift
in
hand
for
Jehovah
6
So
the
princes
of
the
paternal
houses
the
princes
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
the
chiefs
of
thousands
and
of
hundreds
and
the
chiefs
of
the
business
of
the
king
came
forward
voluntarily
7
And
they
gave
to
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
5000
talents
of
gold
10000
darics
10000
talents
of
silver
18000
talents
of
copper
and
100000
talents
of
iron
8
Whoever
had
precious
stones
gave
them
to
the
treasury
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
under
the
care
of
Jehiel
the
Gershonite
9
The
people
rejoiced
over
making
these
voluntary
offerings
for
they
made
the
voluntary
offerings
to
Jehovah
with
a
complete
heart
and
David
the
king
also
rejoiced
greatly
10
Then
David
praised
Jehovah
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
congregation
David
said
May
you
be
praised
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
our
father
throughout
all
eternity
11
Yours
O
Jehovah
are
the
greatness
and
the
mightiness
and
the
beauty
and
the
splendor
and
the
majesty
for
everything
in
the
heavens
and
on
the
earth
is
yours
Yours
is
the
kingdom
O
Jehovah
You
are
the
One
exalting
yourself
as
head
over
all
12
The
riches
and
the
glory
are
from
you
and
you
rule
over
everything
and
in
your
hand
there
are
power
and
mightiness
and
your
hand
is
able
to
make
great
and
to
give
strength
to
all
13
And
now
O
our
God
we
thank
you
and
praise
your
beautiful
name
14
And
yet
who
am
I
and
who
are
my
people
that
we
should
be
in
a
position
to
make
voluntary
offerings
like
this
For
everything
is
from
you
and
we
have
given
to
you
what
comes
from
your
own
hand
15
For
we
are
foreign
residents
in
your
presence
and
settlers
just
like
all
our
forefathers
For
our
days
on
the
earth
are
like
a
shadow—without
hope
16
O
Jehovah
our
God
all
this
wealth
that
we
have
prepared
to
build
for
you
a
house
for
your
holy
name
is
from
your
own
hand
and
it
all
belongs
to
you
17
I
well
know
O
my
God
that
you
examine
the
heart
and
that
you
take
pleasure
in
integrity
In
the
uprightness
of
my
heart
I
have
voluntarily
offered
all
these
things
and
I
am
overjoyed
to
see
your
people
who
are
present
here
make
voluntary
offerings
to
you
18
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Abraham
Isaac
and
Israel
our
forefathers
keep
these
inclinations
and
thoughts
in
the
hearts
of
your
people
forever
and
direct
their
hearts
to
you
19
And
give
a
complete
heart
to
my
son
Solomon
so
that
he
may
observe
your
commandments
your
reminders
and
your
regulations
and
do
all
these
things
and
build
the
temple
for
which
I
have
made
preparation
20
David
then
said
to
all
the
congregation
Now
praise
Jehovah
your
God
And
all
the
congregation
praised
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
and
bowed
low
and
prostrated
themselves
to
Jehovah
and
to
the
king
21
And
they
continued
to
offer
sacrifices
to
Jehovah
and
to
offer
up
burnt
offerings
to
Jehovah
on
the
following
day
1000
young
bulls
1000
rams
1000
male
lambs
and
their
drink
offerings
they
offered
sacrifices
in
great
number
for
all
Israel
22
They
continued
eating
and
drinking
before
Jehovah
on
that
day
with
great
rejoicing
and
for
a
second
time
they
made
Solomon
the
son
of
David
king
and
anointed
him
before
Jehovah
as
leader
and
also
Zadok
as
priest
23
And
Solomon
sat
on
Jehovahs
throne
as
king
in
place
of
David
his
father
and
he
was
successful
and
all
the
Israelites
were
obedient
to
him
24
All
the
princes
the
mighty
warriors
and
also
all
the
sons
of
King
David
submitted
themselves
to
Solomon
the
king
25
And
Jehovah
made
Solomon
exceedingly
great
before
the
eyes
of
all
Israel
and
bestowed
on
him
royal
majesty
such
as
no
king
over
Israel
ever
had
before
26
Thus
David
the
son
of
Jesse
reigned
over
all
Israel
27
and
the
length
of
his
reign
over
Israel
was
40
years
In
Hebron
he
reigned
for
7
years
and
in
Jerusalem
he
reigned
for
33
years
28
And
he
died
at
a
good
old
age
satisfied
with
long
life
wealth
and
glory
and
his
son
Solomon
became
king
in
his
place
29
As
for
the
history
of
King
David
from
beginning
to
end
it
is
written
among
the
words
of
Samuel
the
seer
Nathan
the
prophet
and
Gad
the
visionary
30
together
with
all
his
kingship
his
mightiness
and
the
events
of
the
times
involving
him
and
Israel
and
all
the
surrounding
kingdoms
1
Solomon
the
son
of
David
grew
ever
stronger
in
his
kingship
and
Jehovah
his
God
was
with
him
and
made
him
exceedingly
great
2
Solomon
sent
for
all
Israel
the
chiefs
of
the
thousands
and
of
the
hundreds
the
judges
and
all
the
chieftains
of
all
Israel
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
3
Then
Solomon
and
all
the
congregation
went
to
the
high
place
at
Gibeon
for
that
was
where
the
tent
of
meeting
of
the
true
God
was
which
tent
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
had
made
in
the
wilderness
4
However
David
had
brought
the
Ark
of
the
true
God
up
from
Kiriath-jearim
to
the
place
that
David
had
prepared
for
it
he
had
pitched
a
tent
for
it
in
Jerusalem
5
And
the
copper
altar
that
Bezalel
the
son
of
Uri
the
son
of
Hur
had
made
had
been
put
before
the
tabernacle
of
Jehovah
and
Solomon
and
the
congregation
would
pray
before
it
6
Solomon
now
made
offerings
there
before
Jehovah
and
he
offered
up
1000
burnt
offerings
on
the
copper
altar
of
the
tent
of
meeting
7
That
night
God
appeared
to
Solomon
and
said
to
him
Ask
what
you
would
like
me
to
give
you
8
At
this
Solomon
said
to
God
You
have
shown
great
loyal
love
toward
my
father
David
and
you
have
made
me
king
in
his
place
9
Now
O
Jehovah
God
let
your
promise
to
David
my
father
prove
faithful
for
you
have
made
me
king
over
a
people
as
numerous
as
the
dust
particles
of
the
earth
10
Give
me
now
wisdom
and
knowledge
to
lead
this
people
for
who
can
possibly
judge
this
great
people
of
yours
11
Then
God
said
to
Solomon
Because
this
is
your
hearts
desire
and
you
have
not
asked
for
wealth
riches
and
honor
or
for
the
death
of
those
hating
you
nor
have
you
asked
for
a
long
life
but
you
have
asked
for
wisdom
and
knowledge
to
judge
my
people
over
whom
I
have
made
you
king
12
wisdom
and
knowledge
will
be
given
you
but
I
will
also
give
you
wealth
and
riches
and
honor
such
as
no
kings
before
you
have
had
and
none
after
you
will
have
13
So
Solomon
came
from
the
high
place
at
Gibeon
from
before
the
tent
of
meeting
to
Jerusalem
and
he
reigned
over
Israel
14
Solomon
kept
accumulating
chariots
and
horses
he
had
1400
chariots
and
12000
horses
and
he
kept
them
stationed
in
the
chariot
cities
and
close
by
the
king
in
Jerusalem
15
The
king
made
the
silver
and
the
gold
in
Jerusalem
as
plentiful
as
the
stones
and
cedarwood
as
plentiful
as
the
sycamore
trees
in
the
Shephelah
16
The
horses
of
Solomon
had
been
imported
from
Egypt
and
the
company
of
the
kings
merchants
would
obtain
the
horses
in
droves
for
one
price
17
Each
chariot
imported
from
Egypt
cost
600
silver
pieces
and
a
horse
cost
150
in
turn
they
would
export
them
to
all
the
kings
of
the
Hittites
and
the
kings
of
Syria
1
Solomon
now
gave
the
order
to
build
a
house
for
Jehovahs
name
and
a
house
for
his
kingdom
2
Solomon
enlisted
70000
men
as
common
laborers
80000
men
as
stonecutters
in
the
mountains
and
3600
as
overseers
over
them
3
Further
Solomon
sent
word
to
Hiram
the
king
of
Tyre
Do
for
me
as
you
did
for
David
my
father
when
you
sent
him
cedarwood
to
build
a
house
to
live
in
4
Now
I
am
building
a
house
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
my
God
to
sanctify
it
to
him
to
burn
perfumed
incense
before
him
and
also
for
the
constant
layer
bread
and
the
burnt
offerings
morning
and
evening
on
the
Sabbaths
on
the
new
moons
and
at
the
festival
seasons
of
Jehovah
our
God
This
is
a
lasting
obligation
for
Israel
5
The
house
that
I
am
building
will
be
great
for
our
God
is
greater
than
all
the
other
gods
6
And
who
is
up
to
the
task
of
building
him
a
house
For
the
heavens
and
the
heaven
of
the
heavens
cannot
contain
him
so
who
am
I
that
I
should
build
him
a
house
except
as
a
place
for
making
sacrifices
smoke
before
him
7
Now
send
me
a
craftsman
who
is
skilled
in
working
in
gold
silver
copper
iron
purple
wool
crimson
and
blue
thread
and
who
knows
how
to
cut
engravings
He
will
work
in
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem
with
my
skilled
craftsmen
whom
David
my
father
has
provided
8
And
send
me
timbers
of
cedar
juniper
and
algum
from
Lebanon
for
I
well
know
that
your
servants
are
experienced
at
cutting
down
the
trees
of
Lebanon
My
servants
will
work
along
with
your
servants
9
to
prepare
for
me
great
quantities
of
timber
for
the
house
that
I
am
to
build
will
be
extraordinarily
great
10
Now
look
I
will
supply
the
food
for
your
servants
the
woodcutters
who
cut
down
the
trees
20000
cors
of
wheat
20000
cors
of
barley
20000
baths
of
wine
and
20000
baths
of
oil
11
At
that
Hiram
the
king
of
Tyre
sent
this
written
message
to
Solomon
Because
Jehovah
loves
his
people
he
has
made
you
their
king
12
Hiram
then
said
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
be
praised
who
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
because
he
has
given
to
King
David
a
wise
son
endowed
with
discretion
and
understanding
who
will
build
a
house
for
Jehovah
and
a
house
for
his
kingdom
13
Now
I
am
sending
a
skilled
craftsman
endowed
with
understanding
Hiram-abi
14
who
is
the
son
of
a
Danite
woman
but
whose
father
was
a
man
of
Tyre
he
has
experience
in
working
in
gold
silver
copper
iron
stones
timbers
purple
wool
blue
thread
fine
fabric
and
crimson
He
can
do
every
sort
of
engraving
and
make
any
design
he
is
given
He
will
work
with
your
own
skilled
craftsmen
and
the
skilled
craftsmen
of
my
lord
David
your
father
15
Now
let
my
lord
send
the
wheat
barley
oil
and
wine
he
has
promised
to
his
servants
16
And
we
will
cut
down
trees
from
Lebanon
as
many
as
you
need
and
we
will
bring
them
to
you
as
rafts
by
sea
to
Joppa
and
you
will
take
them
up
to
Jerusalem
17
Solomon
then
took
a
count
of
all
the
men
who
were
foreign
residents
in
the
land
of
Israel
after
the
census
taken
by
David
his
father
and
there
were
found
153600
18
So
he
assigned
70000
of
them
as
common
laborers
80000
as
stonecutters
in
the
mountains
and
3600
as
overseers
for
putting
the
people
to
work
1
Then
Solomon
started
to
build
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
Jerusalem
on
Mount
Moriah
where
Jehovah
had
appeared
to
his
father
David
in
the
place
that
David
had
prepared
on
the
threshing
floor
of
Ornan
the
Jebusite
2
He
started
to
build
on
the
second
day
of
the
second
month
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
reign
3
And
the
foundation
that
Solomon
laid
for
building
the
house
of
the
true
God
was
60
cubits
long
and
20
cubits
wide
according
to
the
former
measurement
4
The
porch
in
front
was
20
cubits
long
corresponding
to
the
width
of
the
house
and
its
height
was
120
and
he
overlaid
it
inside
with
pure
gold
5
He
paneled
the
great
house
with
juniper
wood
after
which
he
covered
it
with
fine
gold
and
then
he
decorated
it
with
palm-tree
figures
and
chains
6
Further
he
overlaid
the
house
with
beautiful
precious
stones
and
the
gold
he
used
was
gold
from
Parvaim
7
He
covered
the
house
the
rafters
the
thresholds
its
walls
and
its
doors
with
gold
and
he
engraved
cherubs
on
the
walls
8
He
now
made
the
Most
Holy
compartment
its
length
matched
the
width
of
the
house
20
cubits
and
its
width
was
20
cubits
He
covered
it
with
600
talents
of
fine
gold
9
The
weight
of
the
gold
for
the
nails
was
50
shekels
and
he
covered
the
roof
chambers
with
gold
10
Then
he
made
in
the
Most
Holy
compartment
two
cherub
sculptures
and
he
overlaid
them
with
gold
11
The
overall
length
of
the
wings
of
the
cherubs
was
20
cubits
one
wing
of
the
first
cherub
was
five
cubits
long
and
touched
the
wall
of
the
house
and
its
other
wing
was
five
cubits
long
and
touched
one
of
the
other
cherubs
wings
12
And
one
wing
of
the
other
cherub
was
five
cubits
long
and
touched
the
other
wall
of
the
house
and
its
other
wing
was
five
cubits
long
and
touched
one
of
the
first
cherubs
wings
13
The
wings
of
these
cherubs
were
spread
out
20
cubits
and
they
stood
on
their
feet
and
they
faced
inward
14
He
also
made
the
curtain
of
blue
thread
purple
wool
crimson
and
fine
fabric
and
incorporated
cherub
designs
into
it
15
Then
he
made
two
pillars
at
the
front
of
the
house
35
cubits
in
length
and
the
capital
on
top
of
each
pillar
was
five
cubits
16
And
he
made
chains
like
necklaces
and
put
them
on
the
tops
of
the
pillars
and
he
made
100
pomegranates
and
put
them
on
the
chains
17
He
set
up
the
pillars
in
front
of
the
temple
one
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
left
he
named
the
one
on
the
right
Jachin
and
the
one
on
the
left
Boaz
1
Then
he
made
the
copper
altar
20
cubits
long
20
cubits
wide
and
10
cubits
high
2
He
made
the
Sea
of
cast
metal
It
was
circular
in
shape
10
cubits
from
brim
to
brim
and
5
cubits
high
and
it
took
a
measuring
line
30
cubits
long
to
encircle
it
3
And
there
were
ornamental
gourds
under
it
completely
encircling
it
ten
to
a
cubit
all
around
the
Sea
The
gourds
were
in
two
rows
and
were
cast
in
one
piece
with
it
4
It
stood
on
12
bulls
3
facing
north
3
facing
west
3
facing
south
and
3
facing
east
and
the
Sea
rested
on
them
and
all
their
hindquarters
were
toward
the
center
5
And
its
thickness
was
a
handbreadth
and
its
brim
was
made
like
the
brim
of
a
cup
like
a
lily
blossom
The
reservoir
could
hold
3000
bath
measures
6
Further
he
made
ten
basins
for
washing
and
put
five
to
the
right
and
five
to
the
left
They
would
rinse
in
them
the
things
used
for
the
burnt
offering
But
the
Sea
was
for
the
priests
for
washing
7
He
then
made
ten
lampstands
of
gold
as
specified
and
put
them
in
the
temple
five
on
the
right
and
five
on
the
left
8
He
also
made
ten
tables
and
placed
them
in
the
temple
five
on
the
right
and
five
on
the
left
and
he
made
100
golden
bowls
9
Then
he
made
the
courtyard
of
the
priests
and
the
great
court
and
the
doors
for
the
court
and
he
overlaid
their
doors
with
copper
10
And
he
placed
the
Sea
on
the
right
side
toward
the
southeast
11
Hiram
also
made
the
cans
the
shovels
and
the
bowls
So
Hiram
finished
the
work
that
he
did
for
King
Solomon
on
the
house
of
the
true
God
12
the
two
pillars
and
the
bowl-shaped
capitals
that
were
on
top
of
the
two
pillars
the
two
networks
to
cover
the
two
bowl-shaped
capitals
that
were
on
top
of
the
pillars
13
the
400
pomegranates
for
the
two
networks
two
rows
of
pomegranates
for
each
network
to
cover
the
two
bowl-shaped
capitals
that
were
on
the
pillars
14
the
ten
carriages
and
the
ten
basins
on
the
carriages
15
the
Sea
and
the
12
bulls
beneath
it
16
and
the
cans
the
shovels
the
forks
and
all
their
utensils
Hiram-abiv
made
of
polished
copper
for
King
Solomon
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
17
The
king
cast
them
in
the
district
of
the
Jordan
in
the
thick
clay
between
Succoth
and
Zeredah
18
Solomon
made
all
these
utensils
in
great
quantities
the
weight
of
the
copper
was
not
ascertained
19
Solomon
made
all
the
utensils
for
the
house
of
the
true
God
the
altar
of
gold
the
tables
with
the
showbread
on
them
20
the
lampstands
and
their
lamps
of
pure
gold
to
burn
before
the
innermost
room
according
to
the
requirements
21
and
the
blossoms
the
lamps
and
the
snuffers
of
gold
the
purest
gold
22
the
extinguishers
the
bowls
the
cups
and
the
fire
holders
of
pure
gold
and
the
entrance
of
the
house
its
inner
doors
for
the
Most
Holy
and
the
doors
of
the
house
of
the
temple
of
gold
1
So
Solomon
completed
all
the
work
he
had
to
do
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
Solomon
then
brought
in
the
things
that
David
his
father
had
made
holy
and
he
put
the
silver
the
gold
and
all
the
articles
into
the
treasuries
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
2
At
that
time
Solomon
congregated
the
elders
of
Israel
all
the
heads
of
the
tribes
the
chieftains
of
the
paternal
houses
of
Israel
They
came
to
Jerusalem
to
bring
up
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
from
the
City
of
David
that
is
Zion
3
All
the
men
of
Israel
assembled
before
the
king
at
the
festival
that
is
held
in
the
seventh
month
4
So
all
the
elders
of
Israel
came
and
the
Levites
lifted
up
the
Ark
5
They
brought
up
the
Ark
the
tent
of
meeting
and
all
the
holy
utensils
that
were
in
the
tent
The
priests
and
the
Levites
brought
them
up
6
King
Solomon
and
the
entire
assembly
of
Israel
who
had
been
summoned
to
meet
with
him
were
before
the
Ark
So
many
sheep
and
cattle
were
being
sacrificed
that
they
could
not
be
counted
or
numbered
7
Then
the
priests
brought
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
to
its
place
into
the
innermost
room
of
the
house
the
Most
Holy
underneath
the
wings
of
the
cherubs
8
Thus
the
wings
of
the
cherubs
were
spread
out
over
the
place
of
the
Ark
so
that
the
cherubs
covered
over
the
Ark
and
its
poles
from
above
9
The
poles
were
so
long
that
the
tips
of
the
poles
were
visible
from
the
Holy
in
front
of
the
innermost
room
but
they
were
not
visible
from
outside
And
they
are
there
to
this
day
10
There
was
nothing
in
the
Ark
but
the
two
tablets
that
Moses
placed
in
it
at
Horeb
when
Jehovah
made
a
covenant
with
the
people
of
Israel
while
they
were
coming
out
of
Egypt
11
When
the
priests
came
out
from
the
holy
place
for
all
the
priests
who
were
present
had
sanctified
themselves
regardless
of
their
divisions
12
all
the
Levite
singers
who
belonged
to
Asaph
to
Heman
to
Jeduthun
and
to
their
sons
and
their
brothers
were
clothed
in
fine
fabric
holding
cymbals
stringed
instruments
and
harps
they
were
standing
east
of
the
altar
and
along
with
them
120
priests
were
sounding
the
trumpets
13
At
the
moment
when
the
trumpeters
and
the
singers
were
praising
and
thanking
Jehovah
in
unison
and
as
the
sound
ascended
from
the
trumpets
the
cymbals
and
the
other
musical
instruments
as
they
were
praising
Jehovah
for
he
is
good
his
loyal
love
endures
forever

then
the
house
the
house
of
Jehovah
was
filled
with
a
cloud
14
The
priests
were
not
able
to
stand
to
minister
because
of
the
cloud
for
the
glory
of
Jehovah
filled
the
house
of
the
true
God
1
At
that
time
Solomon
said
Jehovah
said
he
would
reside
in
the
thick
gloom
2
Now
I
have
built
a
lofty
house
for
you
an
established
place
for
you
to
dwell
in
forever
3
Then
the
king
turned
around
and
began
to
bless
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
while
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
stood
4
He
said
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
be
praised
the
one
who
by
his
own
mouth
promised
my
father
David
and
by
his
own
hands
has
given
fulfillment
saying
5
From
the
day
I
brought
my
people
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
I
have
not
chosen
a
city
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
in
which
to
build
a
house
for
my
name
to
remain
there
and
I
have
not
chosen
a
man
to
become
leader
over
my
people
Israel
6
But
I
have
chosen
Jerusalem
for
my
name
to
remain
there
and
I
have
chosen
David
to
be
over
my
people
Israel
7
And
it
was
the
hearts
desire
of
my
father
David
to
build
a
house
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
8
But
Jehovah
said
to
my
father
David
It
was
your
hearts
desire
to
build
a
house
for
my
name
and
you
did
well
to
desire
this
in
your
heart
9
However
you
will
not
build
the
house
but
your
own
son
who
is
to
be
born
to
you
is
the
one
who
will
build
the
house
for
my
name
10
Jehovah
has
carried
out
the
promise
that
he
made
for
I
have
succeeded
my
father
David
and
I
sit
on
the
throne
of
Israel
just
as
Jehovah
promised
I
have
also
built
the
house
for
the
name
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
11
and
there
I
have
placed
the
Ark
containing
the
covenant
that
Jehovah
made
with
the
people
of
Israel
12
Then
he
stood
before
the
altar
of
Jehovah
in
front
of
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
and
he
spread
out
his
hands
13
For
Solomon
had
made
a
platform
of
copper
and
put
it
in
the
middle
of
the
court
It
was
five
cubits
long
five
cubits
wide
and
three
cubits
high
and
he
stood
on
it
And
he
knelt
down
in
front
of
all
the
congregation
of
Israel
and
spread
his
hands
out
to
the
heavens
14
and
he
said
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
there
is
no
God
like
you
in
the
heavens
or
on
the
earth
keeping
the
covenant
and
showing
loyal
love
to
your
servants
who
are
walking
before
you
with
all
their
heart
15
You
have
kept
the
promise
that
you
made
to
your
servant
David
my
father
You
made
the
promise
with
your
own
mouth
and
this
day
you
have
fulfilled
it
with
your
own
hand
16
And
now
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
keep
the
promise
you
made
to
your
servant
David
my
father
when
you
said
There
will
never
fail
to
be
a
man
of
your
line
before
me
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
Israel
if
only
your
sons
will
pay
attention
to
their
way
by
walking
in
my
law
just
as
you
have
walked
before
me
17
And
now
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
let
the
promise
that
you
made
to
your
servant
David
prove
trustworthy
18
But
will
God
really
dwell
with
mankind
on
the
earth
Look
The
heavens
yes
the
heaven
of
the
heavens
cannot
contain
you
how
much
less
then
this
house
that
I
have
built
19
Now
pay
attention
to
the
prayer
of
your
servant
and
to
his
request
for
favor
O
Jehovah
my
God
and
listen
to
the
cry
for
help
and
to
the
prayer
that
your
servant
is
praying
before
you
20
May
your
eyes
be
open
toward
this
house
day
and
night
toward
the
place
where
you
said
that
you
would
put
your
name
to
listen
to
the
prayer
that
your
servant
prays
toward
this
place
21
And
listen
to
your
servants
pleas
for
help
and
to
the
pleas
of
your
people
Israel
when
they
pray
toward
this
place
and
may
you
hear
from
your
dwelling
place
from
the
heavens
yes
may
you
hear
and
forgive
22
If
a
man
sins
against
his
fellow
man
and
is
made
to
take
an
oath
and
is
brought
under
liability
to
the
oath
and
while
under
the
oath
he
comes
before
your
altar
in
this
house
23
may
you
then
hear
from
the
heavens
and
act
and
judge
your
servants
by
paying
back
the
wicked
one
and
bringing
what
he
did
on
his
own
head
and
by
pronouncing
the
righteous
one
innocent
and
rewarding
him
according
to
his
own
righteousness
24
And
if
your
people
Israel
are
defeated
by
an
enemy
because
they
kept
sinning
against
you
and
they
return
and
glorify
your
name
and
pray
and
beg
for
favor
before
you
in
this
house
25
may
you
then
hear
from
the
heavens
and
forgive
the
sin
of
your
people
Israel
and
bring
them
back
to
the
land
that
you
gave
to
them
and
their
forefathers
26
When
the
heavens
are
shut
up
and
there
is
no
rain
because
they
kept
sinning
against
you
and
they
pray
toward
this
place
and
glorify
your
name
and
turn
back
from
their
sin
because
you
humbled
them
27
may
you
then
hear
from
the
heavens
and
forgive
the
sin
of
your
servants
of
your
people
Israel
for
you
will
instruct
them
about
the
good
way
in
which
they
should
walk
and
bring
rain
on
your
land
that
you
gave
to
your
people
as
an
inheritance
28
If
a
famine
occurs
in
the
land
or
a
pestilence
a
scorching
blight
mildew
swarming
locusts
or
voracious
locusts
or
if
their
enemies
besiege
them
in
any
of
the
cities
of
the
land
or
if
any
other
sort
of
plague
or
disease
occurs
29
whatever
prayer
whatever
request
for
favor
may
be
made
by
any
man
or
by
all
your
people
Israel
for
each
one
knows
his
own
plague
and
his
own
pain
when
they
spread
out
their
hands
toward
this
house
30
then
may
you
hear
from
the
heavens
your
dwelling
place
and
may
you
forgive
and
reward
each
one
according
to
all
his
ways
for
you
know
his
heart
you
alone
truly
know
the
human
heart
31
so
that
they
may
fear
you
by
walking
in
your
ways
all
the
days
they
live
on
the
land
that
you
gave
to
our
forefathers
32
Also
concerning
the
foreigner
who
is
not
part
of
your
people
Israel
and
who
comes
from
a
distant
land
because
of
your
great
name
and
your
mighty
hand
and
your
outstretched
arm
and
he
comes
and
prays
toward
this
house
33
may
you
then
listen
from
the
heavens
your
dwelling
place
and
do
all
that
the
foreigner
asks
of
you
so
that
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
may
know
your
name
and
fear
you
as
your
people
Israel
do
and
may
know
that
your
name
has
been
called
on
this
house
that
I
have
built
34
If
your
people
go
to
war
against
their
enemies
in
the
way
that
you
send
them
and
they
pray
to
you
in
the
direction
of
this
city
that
you
have
chosen
and
toward
the
house
that
I
have
built
for
your
name
35
then
hear
from
the
heavens
their
prayer
and
their
request
for
favor
and
execute
judgment
for
them
36
If
they
sin
against
you
for
there
is
no
man
who
does
not
sin
and
you
are
furious
with
them
and
you
abandon
them
to
an
enemy
and
their
captors
carry
them
off
captive
to
a
land
far
or
near
37
and
they
come
to
their
senses
in
the
land
where
they
were
carried
off
captive
and
they
return
to
you
and
beg
you
for
favor
in
the
land
where
they
are
captives
saying
We
have
sinned
and
done
wrong
we
have
acted
wickedly

38
and
they
return
to
you
with
all
their
heart
and
all
their
soul
in
the
land
of
their
captivity
where
they
were
carried
off
captive
and
they
pray
in
the
direction
of
their
land
that
you
gave
to
their
forefathers
and
the
city
that
you
have
chosen
and
the
house
that
I
have
built
for
your
name
39
then
hear
from
the
heavens
your
dwelling
place
their
prayer
and
their
request
for
favor
and
execute
judgment
for
them
and
forgive
your
people
who
have
sinned
against
you
40
Now
O
my
God
please
may
your
eyes
be
opened
and
your
ears
attentive
to
the
prayer
offered
in
this
place
41
And
now
go
up
O
Jehovah
God
to
your
resting-place
you
and
the
Ark
of
your
strength
Let
your
priests
O
Jehovah
God
be
clothed
with
salvation
and
let
your
loyal
ones
rejoice
in
your
goodness
42
O
Jehovah
God
do
not
reject
your
anointed
one
May
you
remember
your
loyal
love
to
David
your
servant
1
Now
as
soon
as
Solomon
had
finished
praying
fire
came
down
from
the
heavens
and
consumed
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sacrifices
and
Jehovahs
glory
filled
the
house
2
The
priests
were
unable
to
enter
the
house
of
Jehovah
because
Jehovahs
glory
had
filled
the
house
of
Jehovah
3
And
all
the
people
of
Israel
were
looking
on
when
the
fire
came
down
and
the
glory
of
Jehovah
was
upon
the
house
and
they
bowed
low
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
on
the
pavement
and
prostrated
themselves
and
thanked
Jehovah
for
he
is
good
his
loyal
love
endures
forever
4
Now
the
king
and
all
the
people
offered
sacrifices
before
Jehovah
5
King
Solomon
offered
the
sacrifice
of
22000
cattle
and
120000
sheep
Thus
the
king
and
all
the
people
inaugurated
the
house
of
the
true
God
6
The
priests
were
standing
at
their
posts
of
duty
as
were
the
Levites
who
had
the
instruments
used
to
accompany
the
song
to
Jehovah
King
David
had
made
these
instruments
for
giving
thanks
to
Jehovah—for
his
loyal
love
endures
forever—when
David
would
offer
praise
with
them
And
the
priests
were
loudly
sounding
the
trumpets
in
front
of
them
while
all
the
Israelites
were
standing
7
Then
Solomon
sanctified
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
that
was
before
the
house
of
Jehovah
for
there
he
had
to
offer
up
the
burnt
offerings
and
the
fat
pieces
of
the
communion
sacrifices
because
the
copper
altar
that
Solomon
had
made
could
not
contain
the
burnt
sacrifices
the
grain
offerings
and
the
fat
pieces
8
At
that
time
Solomon
held
the
festival
for
seven
days
together
with
all
Israel
a
very
great
congregation
from
Lebo-hamath
down
to
the
Wadi
of
Egypt
9
But
on
the
eighth
day
they
held
a
solemn
assembly
because
they
had
held
the
inauguration
of
the
altar
for
seven
days
and
the
festival
for
seven
days
10
Then
on
the
23rd
day
of
the
seventh
month
he
sent
the
people
away
to
their
homes
rejoicing
and
feeling
glad
of
heart
over
the
goodness
that
Jehovah
had
shown
to
David
and
Solomon
and
Israel
his
people
11
Thus
Solomon
finished
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
house
of
the
king
and
everything
that
came
into
Solomons
heart
to
do
regarding
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
his
own
house
he
accomplished
successfully
12
Jehovah
then
appeared
to
Solomon
during
the
night
and
said
to
him
I
have
heard
your
prayer
and
I
have
chosen
this
place
for
myself
as
a
house
of
sacrifice
13
When
I
shut
up
the
heavens
and
there
is
no
rain
and
when
I
command
the
grasshoppers
to
devour
the
land
and
if
I
send
a
pestilence
among
my
people
14
if
my
people
on
whom
my
name
has
been
called
humble
themselves
and
pray
and
seek
my
face
and
turn
away
from
their
evil
ways
then
I
will
hear
from
the
heavens
and
forgive
their
sin
and
heal
their
land
15
Now
my
eyes
will
be
open
and
my
ears
attentive
to
prayer
at
this
place
16
And
now
I
have
chosen
and
sanctified
this
house
so
that
my
name
may
be
there
permanently
and
my
eyes
and
my
heart
will
always
be
there
17
And
you
if
you
walk
before
me
as
your
father
David
walked
by
doing
everything
I
have
commanded
you
and
you
obey
my
regulations
and
my
judgments
18
then
I
will
establish
the
throne
of
your
kingship
just
as
I
made
a
covenant
with
your
father
David
saying
There
will
never
fail
to
be
a
man
of
your
line
ruling
over
Israel
19
But
if
you
turn
away
and
forsake
my
statutes
and
my
commandments
that
I
have
put
before
you
and
you
go
and
serve
other
gods
and
bow
down
to
them
20
I
will
uproot
Israel
from
my
land
that
I
have
given
them
and
this
house
that
I
have
sanctified
for
my
name
I
will
cast
out
of
my
sight
and
I
will
make
it
an
object
of
scorn
and
a
cause
for
ridicule
among
all
the
peoples
21
And
this
house
will
become
heaps
of
ruins
Everyone
passing
by
it
will
stare
in
amazement
and
will
say
Why
did
Jehovah
do
that
to
this
land
and
this
house
22
Then
they
will
say
It
was
because
they
abandoned
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
who
had
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
and
they
embraced
other
gods
and
bowed
down
to
them
and
served
them
That
is
why
he
brought
all
this
calamity
on
them
1
At
the
end
of
20
years
during
which
Solomon
built
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
his
own
house
2
Solomon
rebuilt
the
cities
that
Hiram
had
given
Solomon
and
settled
Israelites
there
3
Furthermore
Solomon
went
to
Hamath-zobah
and
captured
it
4
Then
he
built
up
Tadmor
in
the
wilderness
and
all
the
storage
cities
that
he
had
built
in
Hamath
5
He
also
built
up
Upper
Beth-horon
and
Lower
Beth-horon
fortified
cities
with
walls
gates
and
bars
6
and
Baalath
as
well
as
all
of
Solomons
storage
cities
all
the
chariot
cities
the
cities
for
the
horsemen
and
whatever
Solomon
desired
to
build
in
Jerusalem
in
Lebanon
and
in
all
the
land
of
his
dominion
7
As
for
all
the
people
who
were
left
from
the
Hittites
the
Amorites
the
Perizzites
the
Hivites
and
the
Jebusites
who
were
not
part
of
Israel
8
their
descendants
who
were
left
in
the
land—those
whom
the
Israelites
had
not
exterminated—were
conscripted
by
Solomon
for
forced
labor
until
this
day
9
But
Solomon
did
not
make
any
of
the
Israelites
slaves
for
his
work
for
they
were
his
warriors
the
chiefs
of
his
adjutants
and
the
chiefs
of
his
charioteers
and
horsemen
10
There
were
250
chiefs
of
the
deputies
of
King
Solomon
the
foremen
over
the
people
11
Solomon
also
brought
Pharaohs
daughter
up
from
the
City
of
David
to
the
house
that
he
had
built
for
her
for
he
said
Although
she
is
my
wife
she
should
not
dwell
in
the
house
of
King
David
of
Israel
for
the
places
to
which
the
Ark
of
Jehovah
has
come
are
holy
12
Then
Solomon
offered
up
burnt
sacrifices
to
Jehovah
on
the
altar
of
Jehovah
that
he
had
built
in
front
of
the
porch
13
He
followed
the
daily
routine
and
made
offerings
according
to
the
commandment
of
Moses
for
the
Sabbaths
the
new
moons
and
the
appointed
festivals
three
times
in
the
year—the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
the
Festival
of
Weeks
and
the
Festival
of
Booths
14
Further
he
appointed
the
divisions
of
the
priests
for
their
services
according
to
the
rule
of
his
father
David
and
the
Levites
for
their
posts
of
duty
to
praise
and
to
minister
in
the
presence
of
the
priests
according
to
the
daily
routine
and
the
gatekeepers
in
their
divisions
for
the
different
gates
for
such
was
the
commandment
of
David
the
man
of
the
true
God
15
And
they
did
not
deviate
from
the
kings
commandment
to
the
priests
and
the
Levites
concerning
any
matter
or
concerning
the
storehouses
16
So
Solomons
work
was
all
well-organized
from
the
day
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
was
laid
until
it
was
finished
So
the
house
of
Jehovah
was
completed
17
It
was
then
that
Solomon
went
to
Ezion-geber
and
to
Eloth
on
the
seashore
in
the
land
of
Edom
18
Hiram
sent
him
ships
and
experienced
seamen
by
means
of
his
own
servants
They
went
with
Solomons
servants
to
Ophir
and
took
from
there
450
talents
of
gold
and
brought
it
to
King
Solomon
1
Now
the
queen
of
Sheba
heard
the
report
about
Solomon
so
she
came
to
Jerusalem
to
test
Solomon
with
perplexing
questions
She
was
accompanied
by
a
very
impressive
entourage
with
camels
carrying
balsam
oil
and
great
quantities
of
gold
and
precious
stones
She
went
in
to
Solomon
and
spoke
to
him
about
everything
that
was
close
to
her
heart
2
Solomon
then
answered
all
her
questions
There
was
nothing
too
difficult
for
Solomon
to
explain
to
her
3
When
the
queen
of
Sheba
had
seen
Solomons
wisdom
the
house
that
he
built
4
the
food
of
his
table
the
seating
of
his
servants
the
table
service
of
his
waiters
and
their
attire
his
cupbearers
and
their
attire
and
his
burnt
sacrifices
that
he
regularly
offered
up
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
she
was
left
completely
breathless
5
So
she
said
to
the
king
The
report
that
I
heard
in
my
own
land
about
your
achievements
and
about
your
wisdom
was
true
6
But
I
did
not
put
faith
in
the
reports
until
I
had
come
and
had
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
And
look
I
had
not
been
told
the
half
of
your
great
wisdom
You
have
far
surpassed
the
report
that
I
heard
7
Happy
are
your
men
and
happy
are
your
servants
who
stand
before
you
constantly
listening
to
your
wisdom
8
May
Jehovah
your
God
be
praised
who
has
taken
pleasure
in
you
by
putting
you
on
his
throne
as
king
for
Jehovah
your
God
Because
your
God
loves
Israel
in
order
to
make
it
continue
forever
he
appointed
you
over
it
as
king
to
administer
justice
and
righteousness
9
Then
she
gave
the
king
120
talents
of
gold
and
a
great
quantity
of
balsam
oil
and
precious
stones
Never
again
was
such
balsam
oil
brought
in
as
what
the
queen
of
Sheba
gave
to
King
Solomon
10
Moreover
the
servants
of
Hiram
and
the
servants
of
Solomon
who
brought
gold
from
Ophir
also
brought
algum
timbers
and
precious
stones
11
The
king
made
from
the
algum
timbers
stairs
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
for
the
kings
house
as
well
as
harps
and
stringed
instruments
for
the
singers
Nothing
like
them
had
ever
been
seen
before
in
the
land
of
Judah
12
King
Solomon
also
gave
the
queen
of
Sheba
whatever
she
desired
and
asked
for
more
than
what
she
had
brought
to
the
king
Then
she
left
and
returned
to
her
own
land
together
with
her
servants
13
And
the
weight
of
the
gold
that
came
to
Solomon
in
one
year
amounted
to
666
talents
of
gold
14
besides
that
brought
in
by
the
merchants
and
the
traders
and
all
the
kings
of
the
Arabs
and
the
governors
of
the
land
who
were
bringing
gold
and
silver
in
to
Solomon
15
King
Solomon
made
200
large
shields
of
alloyed
gold
600
shekels
of
alloyed
gold
went
on
each
shield
16
and
300
bucklers
of
alloyed
gold
three
minas
of
gold
went
on
each
buckler
Then
the
king
put
them
in
the
House
of
the
Forest
of
Lebanon
17
The
king
also
made
a
great
ivory
throne
and
overlaid
it
with
pure
gold
18
There
were
six
steps
to
the
throne
and
there
was
a
gold
footstool
attached
to
the
throne
and
there
were
armrests
on
both
sides
of
the
seat
and
two
lions
were
standing
beside
the
armrests
19
And
there
were
12
lions
standing
on
the
six
steps
one
at
each
end
of
the
six
steps
No
other
kingdom
had
made
anything
like
it
20
All
the
drinking
vessels
of
King
Solomon
were
of
gold
and
all
the
utensils
of
the
House
of
the
Forest
of
Lebanon
were
of
pure
gold
There
was
nothing
made
of
silver
for
silver
was
considered
as
nothing
in
the
days
of
Solomon
21
For
the
kings
ships
would
go
to
Tarshish
with
the
servants
of
Hiram
Once
every
three
years
the
ships
of
Tarshish
would
come
loaded
with
gold
and
silver
ivory
apes
and
peacocks
22
So
King
Solomon
was
greater
than
all
the
other
kings
of
the
earth
in
riches
and
wisdom
23
And
the
kings
of
all
the
earth
sought
an
audience
with
Solomon
to
hear
his
wisdom
that
the
true
God
had
put
in
his
heart
24
They
would
each
bring
a
gift—articles
of
silver
articles
of
gold
garments
armor
balsam
oil
horses
and
mules—and
this
continued
year
after
year
25
And
Solomon
had
4000
stalls
for
his
horses
and
chariots
and
12000
horses
and
he
kept
them
stationed
in
the
chariot
cities
and
close
by
the
king
in
Jerusalem
26
And
he
ruled
over
all
the
kings
from
the
River
to
the
land
of
the
Philistines
and
to
the
boundary
of
Egypt
27
The
king
made
the
silver
in
Jerusalem
as
plentiful
as
the
stones
and
cedarwood
as
plentiful
as
the
sycamore
trees
in
the
Shephelah
28
And
they
would
bring
horses
to
Solomon
from
Egypt
and
from
all
the
other
lands
29
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Solomon
from
beginning
to
end
is
it
not
written
among
the
words
of
Nathan
the
prophet
in
the
prophecy
of
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
and
in
the
record
of
visions
of
Iddo
the
visionary
concerning
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
30
Solomon
reigned
in
Jerusalem
over
all
Israel
for
40
years
31
Then
Solomon
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
So
they
buried
him
in
the
City
of
David
his
father
and
his
son
Rehoboam
became
king
in
his
place
1
Rehoboam
went
to
Shechem
for
all
Israel
had
come
to
Shechem
to
make
him
king
2
As
soon
as
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
heard
of
it
he
was
still
in
Egypt
because
he
had
fled
on
account
of
King
Solomon
Jeroboam
came
back
from
Egypt
3
Then
they
sent
for
him
and
Jeroboam
and
all
Israel
came
to
Rehoboam
and
said
4
Your
father
made
our
yoke
harsh
But
if
you
make
the
harsh
service
of
your
father
easier
and
you
lighten
the
heavy
yoke
he
put
on
us
we
will
serve
you
5
At
this
he
said
to
them
Return
to
me
after
three
days
So
the
people
went
away
6
King
Rehoboam
then
consulted
with
the
older
men
who
had
served
his
father
Solomon
while
he
was
alive
saying
What
advice
would
you
give
on
how
to
reply
to
this
people
7
They
answered
him
If
you
are
good
to
this
people
and
please
them
and
give
them
a
favorable
answer
they
will
always
be
your
servants
8
However
he
rejected
the
advice
that
the
older
men
gave
him
and
he
consulted
with
the
young
men
who
had
grown
up
with
him
and
who
were
now
his
attendants
9
He
asked
them
What
advice
do
you
offer
on
how
we
should
reply
to
this
people
who
have
said
to
me
Make
the
yoke
your
father
put
on
us
lighter
10
The
young
men
who
had
grown
up
with
him
said
to
him
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
the
people
who
have
said
to
you
Your
father
made
our
yoke
heavy
but
you
should
make
it
lighter
for
us
this
is
what
you
should
tell
them
My
little
finger
will
be
thicker
than
my
fathers
hips
11
My
father
imposed
a
heavy
yoke
on
you
but
I
will
add
to
your
yoke
My
father
punished
you
with
whips
but
I
will
do
so
with
scourges
12
Jeroboam
and
all
the
people
came
to
Rehoboam
on
the
third
day
just
as
the
king
had
said
Return
to
me
on
the
third
day
13
But
the
king
answered
them
harshly
Thus
King
Rehoboam
rejected
the
advice
of
the
older
men
14
He
spoke
to
them
according
to
the
advice
of
the
young
men
saying
I
will
make
your
yoke
heavier
and
I
will
add
to
it
My
father
punished
you
with
whips
but
I
will
do
so
with
scourges
15
So
the
king
did
not
listen
to
the
people
for
this
turn
of
events
was
caused
by
the
true
God
in
order
to
carry
out
the
word
that
Jehovah
had
spoken
through
Ahijah
the
Shilonite
to
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
16
As
for
all
Israel
because
the
king
refused
to
listen
to
them
the
people
replied
to
the
king
What
share
do
we
have
in
David
We
have
no
inheritance
in
the
son
of
Jesse
Each
one
to
your
gods
O
Israel
Now
look
after
your
own
house
O
David
With
that
all
Israel
returned
to
their
homes
17
But
Rehoboam
continued
to
reign
over
the
Israelites
living
in
the
cities
of
Judah
18
Then
King
Rehoboam
sent
Hadoram
who
was
in
charge
of
those
conscripted
for
forced
labor
but
the
Israelites
stoned
him
to
death
King
Rehoboam
managed
to
mount
his
chariot
to
flee
to
Jerusalem
19
And
the
Israelites
have
been
in
revolt
against
the
house
of
David
down
to
this
day
1
When
Rehoboam
arrived
in
Jerusalem
he
immediately
congregated
the
house
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
180000
trained
warriors
to
fight
against
Israel
in
order
to
restore
the
kingdom
to
Rehoboam
2
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Shemaiah
the
man
of
the
true
God
saying
3
Say
to
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon
the
king
of
Judah
and
to
all
Israel
in
Judah
and
Benjamin
4
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
must
not
go
up
and
fight
against
your
brothers
Each
of
you
return
to
his
house
for
I
have
caused
this
to
happen
So
they
obeyed
the
word
of
Jehovah
and
returned
and
did
not
go
against
Jeroboam
5
Rehoboam
lived
in
Jerusalem
and
built
fortified
cities
in
Judah
6
Thus
he
built
up
Bethlehem
Etam
Tekoa
7
Beth-zur
Soco
Adullam
8
Gath
Mareshah
Ziph
9
Adoraim
Lachish
Azekah
10
Zorah
Aijalon
and
Hebron
fortified
cities
that
were
in
Judah
and
Benjamin
11
Further
he
reinforced
the
fortified
places
and
put
commanders
in
them
and
supplied
them
with
food
and
oil
and
wine
12
and
he
supplied
all
the
different
cities
with
large
shields
and
lances
he
reinforced
them
to
a
very
great
degree
And
Judah
and
Benjamin
remained
his
13
And
the
priests
and
the
Levites
who
were
in
all
Israel
took
their
stand
with
him
coming
out
of
all
their
territories
14
The
Levites
left
their
pastures
and
their
possession
and
came
to
Judah
and
Jerusalem
because
Jeroboam
and
his
sons
had
dismissed
them
from
serving
as
priests
to
Jehovah
15
Jeroboam
then
appointed
his
own
priests
for
the
high
places
and
for
the
goatlike
demons
and
for
the
calves
that
he
had
made
16
And
those
from
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
who
had
their
heart
set
on
seeking
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
followed
them
to
Jerusalem
to
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
17
For
three
years
they
strengthened
the
kingship
of
Judah
and
supported
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon
for
they
walked
in
the
way
of
David
and
Solomon
for
three
years
18
Then
Rehoboam
took
as
his
wife
Mahalath
the
daughter
of
Davids
son
Jerimoth
and
of
Abihail
the
daughter
of
Jesses
son
Eliab
19
In
time
she
bore
him
sons
Jeush
Shemariah
and
Zaham
20
After
her
he
married
Maacah
the
granddaughter
of
Absalom
In
time
she
bore
him
Abijah
Attai
Ziza
and
Shelomith
21
Rehoboam
loved
Maacah
the
granddaughter
of
Absalom
more
than
all
his
other
wives
and
concubines
for
he
took
18
wives
and
60
concubines
and
he
became
father
to
28
sons
and
60
daughters
22
So
Rehoboam
appointed
Abijah
the
son
of
Maacah
as
head
and
leader
among
his
brothers
for
he
intended
to
make
him
king
23
However
he
acted
with
understanding
and
sent
some
of
his
sons
to
all
the
regions
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
to
all
the
fortified
cities
and
gave
them
abundant
provisions
and
acquired
many
wives
for
them
1
Soon
after
the
kingship
of
Rehoboam
was
firmly
established
and
he
had
become
strong
he
abandoned
the
Law
of
Jehovah
and
also
all
Israel
with
him
2
In
the
fifth
year
of
King
Rehoboam
King
Shishak
of
Egypt
came
up
against
Jerusalem
for
they
had
behaved
unfaithfully
toward
Jehovah
3
He
had
1200
chariots
60000
horsemen
and
countless
troops
who
came
with
him
from
Egypt—Libyans
Sukkiim
and
Ethiopians
4
He
captured
the
fortified
cities
of
Judah
and
finally
reached
Jerusalem
5
Shemaiah
the
prophet
came
to
Rehoboam
and
the
princes
of
Judah
who
had
gathered
at
Jerusalem
because
of
Shishak
and
he
said
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
have
abandoned
me
so
I
have
also
abandoned
you
to
the
hand
of
Shishak
6
At
that
the
princes
of
Israel
and
the
king
humbled
themselves
and
said
Jehovah
is
righteous
7
When
Jehovah
saw
that
they
had
humbled
themselves
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Shemaiah
saying
They
have
humbled
themselves
I
will
not
destroy
them
and
in
a
little
while
I
will
rescue
them
I
will
not
pour
out
my
wrath
on
Jerusalem
through
Shishak
8
But
they
will
become
his
servants
so
that
they
will
know
the
difference
between
serving
me
and
serving
the
kings
of
other
lands
9
So
King
Shishak
of
Egypt
came
up
against
Jerusalem
He
took
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
treasures
of
the
kings
house
He
took
everything
including
the
gold
shields
that
Solomon
had
made
10
So
King
Rehoboam
made
copper
shields
to
replace
them
and
he
entrusted
them
to
the
chiefs
of
the
guard
who
guarded
the
entrance
of
the
kings
house
11
Whenever
the
king
came
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
guards
would
come
in
and
carry
them
and
then
they
would
return
them
to
the
guard
chamber
12
Because
the
king
humbled
himself
Jehovahs
anger
turned
away
from
him
and
he
did
not
destroy
them
completely
Moreover
there
were
some
good
things
found
in
Judah
13
King
Rehoboam
strengthened
his
position
in
Jerusalem
and
continued
to
reign
Rehoboam
was
41
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
17
years
in
Jerusalem
the
city
that
Jehovah
had
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
as
the
place
to
put
his
name
The
name
of
the
kings
mother
was
Naamah
the
Ammonitess
14
But
he
did
what
was
bad
for
he
had
not
resolved
in
his
heart
to
search
for
Jehovah
15
As
for
Rehoboams
history
from
beginning
to
end
is
it
not
written
among
the
words
of
Shemaiah
the
prophet
and
of
Iddo
the
visionary
in
the
genealogical
record
And
there
were
constant
wars
between
Rehoboam
and
Jeroboam
16
Then
Rehoboam
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
in
the
City
of
David
and
his
son
Abijah
became
king
in
his
place
1
In
the
18th
year
of
King
Jeroboam
Abijah
became
king
over
Judah
2
He
reigned
for
three
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Micaiah
the
daughter
of
Uriel
of
Gibeah
And
there
was
war
between
Abijah
and
Jeroboam
3
So
Abijah
went
to
war
with
an
army
of
400000
mighty
trained
warriors
And
Jeroboam
drew
up
in
battle
formation
against
him
with
800000
trained
men
mighty
warriors
4
Abijah
now
stood
on
Mount
Zemaraim
which
is
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
and
said
Hear
me
O
Jeroboam
and
all
Israel
5
Do
you
not
know
that
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
gave
to
David
a
kingdom
over
Israel
forever
to
him
and
to
his
sons
by
a
covenant
of
salt
6
But
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
the
servant
of
Davids
son
Solomon
rose
up
and
rebelled
against
his
lord
7
And
idle
worthless
men
kept
gathering
to
him
And
they
proved
superior
to
Rehoboam
the
son
of
Solomon
when
Rehoboam
was
young
and
fainthearted
and
he
could
not
hold
his
own
against
them
8
And
now
you
think
you
can
hold
your
own
against
the
kingdom
of
Jehovah
in
the
hand
of
the
sons
of
David
because
you
are
a
large
crowd
and
you
have
the
golden
calves
that
Jeroboam
made
as
gods
for
you
9
Have
you
not
driven
out
Jehovahs
priests
the
descendants
of
Aaron
and
the
Levites
and
have
you
not
appointed
your
own
priests
just
like
the
peoples
of
the
other
lands
Anyone
who
came
along
with
a
young
bull
and
seven
rams
could
become
a
priest
of
what
are
not
gods
10
As
for
us
Jehovah
is
our
God
and
we
have
not
abandoned
him
our
priests
the
descendants
of
Aaron
are
ministering
to
Jehovah
and
the
Levites
assist
in
the
work
11
They
are
making
burnt
offerings
smoke
to
Jehovah
each
morning
and
each
evening
along
with
perfumed
incense
and
the
layer
bread
is
on
the
table
of
pure
gold
and
they
light
up
the
golden
lampstand
and
its
lamps
each
evening
because
we
are
caring
for
our
responsibility
to
Jehovah
our
God
but
you
have
abandoned
him
12
Now
look
the
true
God
is
with
us
leading
us
with
his
priests
and
the
signal
trumpets
for
sounding
the
battle
alarm
against
you
O
men
of
Israel
do
not
fight
against
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
for
you
will
not
be
successful
13
But
Jeroboam
dispatched
an
ambush
to
come
from
behind
them
so
that
they
were
in
front
of
Judah
and
the
ambush
was
behind
them
14
When
the
men
of
Judah
turned
around
they
saw
that
they
had
to
fight
the
battle
both
in
front
and
from
behind
So
they
began
to
cry
out
to
Jehovah
while
the
priests
were
loudly
sounding
the
trumpets
15
The
men
of
Judah
broke
out
in
a
war
cry
and
when
the
men
of
Judah
shouted
the
war
cry
the
true
God
defeated
Jeroboam
and
all
Israel
before
Abijah
and
Judah
16
The
Israelites
fled
before
Judah
and
God
gave
them
into
their
hand
17
Abijah
and
his
people
inflicted
a
great
slaughter
on
them
and
the
slain
of
Israel
kept
falling
500000
trained
men
18
Thus
the
men
of
Israel
were
humbled
at
that
time
but
the
men
of
Judah
proved
superior
because
they
relied
on
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
19
Abijah
kept
chasing
after
Jeroboam
and
captured
cities
from
him
Bethel
and
its
dependent
towns
Jeshanah
and
its
dependent
towns
and
Ephrain
and
its
dependent
towns
20
And
Jeroboam
never
regained
his
power
during
the
time
of
Abijah
then
Jehovah
struck
him
down
and
he
died
21
But
Abijah
grew
in
strength
In
time
he
took
14
wives
and
he
became
father
to
22
sons
and
16
daughters
22
And
the
rest
of
Abijahs
history
his
deeds
and
his
words
is
recorded
in
the
writings
of
the
prophet
Iddo
1
Then
Abijah
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
City
of
David
and
his
son
Asa
became
king
in
his
place
In
his
days
the
land
had
rest
for
ten
years
2
Asa
did
what
was
good
and
right
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
his
God
3
He
removed
the
foreign
altars
and
the
high
places
smashed
the
sacred
pillars
and
cut
down
the
sacred
poles
4
Further
he
told
Judah
to
search
for
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
and
to
observe
the
Law
and
the
commandment
5
So
he
removed
from
all
the
cities
of
Judah
the
high
places
and
the
incense
stands
and
under
him
the
kingdom
continued
without
disturbance
6
He
built
fortified
cities
in
Judah
since
the
land
had
no
disturbance
and
there
was
no
war
against
him
during
these
years
for
Jehovah
gave
him
rest
7
He
said
to
Judah
Let
us
build
these
cities
and
surround
them
with
walls
and
towers
gates
and
bars
For
the
land
is
still
at
our
disposal
because
we
have
searched
for
Jehovah
our
God
We
have
searched
and
he
has
given
us
rest
all
around
So
their
building
was
successful
8
Asa
had
an
army
of
300000
men
from
Judah
equipped
with
large
shields
and
lances
And
out
of
Benjamin
were
280000
mighty
warriors
who
carried
bucklers
and
were
armed
with
bows
9
Later
Zerah
the
Ethiopian
came
against
them
with
an
army
of
1000000
men
and
300
chariots
When
he
reached
Mareshah
10
Asa
went
out
against
him
and
they
drew
up
in
battle
formation
in
the
Valley
of
Zephathah
at
Mareshah
11
Asa
then
called
to
Jehovah
his
God
and
said
O
Jehovah
it
does
not
matter
to
you
whether
those
you
help
are
many
or
have
no
power
Help
us
O
Jehovah
our
God
for
we
are
relying
on
you
and
in
your
name
we
have
come
against
this
crowd
O
Jehovah
you
are
our
God
Do
not
let
mortal
man
prevail
against
you
12
So
Jehovah
defeated
the
Ethiopians
before
Asa
and
before
Judah
and
the
Ethiopians
fled
13
Asa
and
the
people
with
him
pursued
them
as
far
as
Gerar
and
the
Ethiopians
continued
falling
until
not
one
of
them
was
alive
for
they
were
crushed
by
Jehovah
and
by
his
army
Afterward
they
carried
off
a
very
great
deal
of
spoil
14
Further
they
struck
all
the
cities
around
Gerar
for
the
dread
of
Jehovah
had
come
upon
them
and
they
plundered
all
the
cities
for
there
was
much
to
plunder
in
them
15
They
also
attacked
the
tents
of
those
with
livestock
and
they
captured
a
great
number
of
flocks
and
camels
after
which
they
returned
to
Jerusalem
1
Now
the
spirit
of
God
came
upon
Azariah
the
son
of
Oded
2
So
he
went
out
to
meet
Asa
and
said
to
him
Hear
me
O
Asa
and
all
Judah
and
Benjamin
Jehovah
is
with
you
as
long
as
you
remain
with
him
and
if
you
search
for
him
he
will
let
himself
be
found
by
you
but
if
you
abandon
him
he
will
abandon
you
3
For
a
long
time
Israel
had
been
without
the
true
God
without
a
priest
teaching
and
without
law
4
But
when
in
their
distress
they
returned
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
and
searched
for
him
he
let
himself
be
found
by
them
5
In
those
times
no
one
could
travel
safely
for
there
was
much
unrest
among
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
lands
6
Nation
was
being
crushed
by
nation
and
one
city
by
another
city
because
God
kept
them
in
disorder
with
every
sort
of
distress
7
But
you
be
strong
and
do
not
become
discouraged
for
your
activity
will
be
rewarded
8
As
soon
as
Asa
heard
these
words
and
the
prophecy
of
Oded
the
prophet
he
took
courage
and
removed
the
disgusting
idols
from
all
the
land
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
and
from
the
cities
that
he
had
captured
from
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
and
he
restored
Jehovahs
altar
that
was
before
the
porch
of
Jehovah
9
And
he
gathered
together
all
Judah
and
Benjamin
and
the
foreign
residents
with
them
from
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
and
Simeon
for
they
had
deserted
to
him
from
Israel
in
great
number
when
they
saw
that
Jehovah
his
God
was
with
him
10
So
they
were
gathered
together
at
Jerusalem
in
the
third
month
of
the
15th
year
of
Asas
reign
11
On
that
day
they
sacrificed
to
Jehovah
from
the
spoil
they
had
brought
700
cattle
and
7000
sheep
12
Furthermore
they
entered
into
a
covenant
to
search
for
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
13
Whoever
would
not
search
for
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
was
to
be
put
to
death
whether
small
or
great
man
or
woman
14
So
they
took
an
oath
to
Jehovah
with
a
loud
voice
with
joyful
shouting
and
with
the
trumpets
and
horns
15
And
all
Judah
rejoiced
over
the
oath
for
they
had
taken
the
oath
with
all
their
heart
and
they
eagerly
sought
him
and
he
let
himself
be
found
by
them
and
Jehovah
continued
to
give
them
rest
on
every
side
16
Asa
the
king
even
removed
Maacah
his
grandmother
from
her
position
as
queen
mother
because
she
had
made
an
obscene
idol
for
the
worship
of
the
sacred
pole
Asa
cut
down
her
obscene
idol
and
pulverized
it
and
burned
it
in
the
Kidron
Valley
17
But
the
high
places
were
not
removed
from
Israel
Nevertheless
Asas
heart
was
complete
all
his
life
18
And
he
brought
the
things
that
he
and
his
father
had
made
holy
into
the
house
of
the
true
God—silver
gold
and
various
utensils
19
There
was
no
war
until
the
35th
year
of
Asas
reign
1
In
the
36th
year
of
the
reign
of
Asa
King
Baasha
of
Israel
came
up
against
Judah
and
began
to
build
up
Ramah
to
prevent
anyone
from
going
out
or
coming
in
to
King
Asa
of
Judah
2
At
that
Asa
brought
out
silver
and
gold
from
the
treasuries
of
Jehovahs
house
and
the
kings
house
and
sent
them
to
King
Ben-hadad
of
Syria
who
was
dwelling
in
Damascus
saying
3
There
is
a
treaty
between
me
and
you
and
between
my
father
and
your
father
I
am
sending
you
silver
and
gold
Come
break
your
treaty
with
King
Baasha
of
Israel
so
that
he
will
withdraw
from
me
4
Ben-hadad
listened
to
King
Asa
and
sent
the
chiefs
of
his
armies
against
the
cities
of
Israel
and
they
struck
down
Ijon
Dan
Abel-maim
and
all
the
storage
places
of
the
cities
of
Naphtali
5
When
Baasha
heard
of
it
he
immediately
quit
building
Ramah
and
abandoned
his
work
on
it
6
King
Asa
then
took
all
Judah
and
they
carried
off
the
stones
and
timbers
of
Ramah
that
Baasha
had
been
building
with
and
with
them
he
built
up
Geba
and
Mizpah
7
At
that
time
Hanani
the
seer
came
to
King
Asa
of
Judah
and
said
to
him
Because
you
relied
on
the
king
of
Syria
and
did
not
rely
on
Jehovah
your
God
the
army
of
the
king
of
Syria
has
escaped
out
of
your
hand
8
Were
not
the
Ethiopians
and
the
Libyans
a
very
great
army
with
many
chariots
and
horsemen
But
because
you
relied
on
Jehovah
he
gave
them
into
your
hand
9
For
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
are
roving
about
through
all
the
earth
to
show
his
strength
in
behalf
of
those
whose
heart
is
complete
toward
him
You
have
acted
foolishly
in
this
matter
from
now
on
there
will
be
wars
against
you
10
However
Asa
became
offended
at
the
seer
and
put
him
in
prison
because
he
was
enraged
at
him
over
this
And
Asa
began
to
mistreat
others
among
the
people
at
that
same
time
11
Now
the
history
of
Asa
from
beginning
to
end
is
written
in
the
Book
of
the
Kings
of
Judah
and
of
Israel
12
In
the
39th
year
of
his
reign
Asa
developed
an
ailment
in
his
feet
until
he
became
very
sick
and
even
in
his
sickness
he
turned
not
to
Jehovah
but
to
the
healers
13
Then
Asa
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
he
died
in
the
41st
year
of
his
reign
14
So
they
buried
him
in
the
grand
burial
place
that
he
had
excavated
for
himself
in
the
City
of
David
and
they
laid
him
on
a
bier
that
had
been
filled
with
balsam
oil
and
different
sorts
of
ingredients
mixed
into
a
specially
made
ointment
Further
they
made
an
extraordinarily
great
funeral
burning
for
him
1
And
his
son
Jehoshaphat
became
king
in
his
place
and
he
strengthened
his
position
over
Israel
2
He
stationed
military
forces
in
all
the
fortified
cities
of
Judah
and
put
garrisons
in
the
land
of
Judah
and
in
the
cities
of
Ephraim
that
Asa
his
father
had
captured
3
Jehovah
continued
with
Jehoshaphat
because
he
walked
in
the
former
ways
of
his
forefather
David
and
did
not
search
for
the
Baals
4
For
he
searched
for
the
God
of
his
father
and
followed
his
commandment
and
not
the
practices
of
Israel
5
Jehovah
kept
the
kingdom
firmly
established
in
his
hand
and
all
Judah
continued
to
give
gifts
to
Jehoshaphat
and
he
had
riches
and
glory
in
abundance
6
His
heart
became
bold
in
the
ways
of
Jehovah
and
he
even
removed
the
high
places
and
the
sacred
poles
from
Judah
7
In
the
third
year
of
his
reign
he
sent
for
his
princes
Ben-hail
Obadiah
Zechariah
Nethanel
and
Micaiah
to
teach
in
the
cities
of
Judah
8
There
were
Levites
with
them
Shemaiah
Nethaniah
Zebadiah
Asahel
Shemiramoth
Jehonathan
Adonijah
Tobijah
and
Tob-adonijah
and
along
with
them
Elishama
and
Jehoram
the
priests
9
They
began
teaching
in
Judah
taking
with
them
the
book
of
Jehovahs
Law
and
they
went
around
through
all
the
cities
of
Judah
teaching
among
the
people
10
And
the
dread
of
Jehovah
came
upon
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
lands
surrounding
Judah
and
they
did
not
fight
against
Jehoshaphat
11
And
the
Philistines
brought
to
Jehoshaphat
gifts
and
money
as
tribute
The
Arabs
brought
him
7700
rams
and
7700
male
goats
from
their
flocks
12
Jehoshaphat
grew
greater
and
greater
and
he
continued
building
fortified
places
and
storage
cities
in
Judah
13
He
carried
out
extensive
projects
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
he
had
soldiers
mighty
warriors
in
Jerusalem
14
These
were
grouped
by
their
paternal
houses
of
Judah
the
chiefs
of
thousands
Adnah
the
chief
and
with
him
were
300000
mighty
warriors
15
And
under
his
command
was
Jehohanan
the
chief
and
with
him
were
280000
16
And
also
under
his
command
was
Amasiah
the
son
of
Zichri
who
volunteered
for
Jehovahs
service
and
with
him
were
200000
mighty
warriors
17
And
out
of
Benjamin
was
Eliada
a
mighty
warrior
and
with
him
were
200000
men
equipped
with
the
bow
and
shield
18
And
under
his
command
was
Jehozabad
and
with
him
were
180000
men
equipped
for
the
army
19
These
were
ministering
to
the
king
in
addition
to
those
whom
the
king
put
in
the
fortified
cities
throughout
all
Judah
1
Jehoshaphat
had
riches
and
glory
in
abundance
but
he
made
a
marriage
alliance
with
Ahab
2
So
years
later
he
went
down
to
Ahab
at
Samaria
and
Ahab
sacrificed
sheep
and
cattle
in
abundance
for
him
and
for
the
people
with
him
And
he
urged
him
to
go
up
against
Ramoth-gilead
3
Then
King
Ahab
of
Israel
said
to
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Judah
Will
you
go
with
me
to
Ramoth-gilead
He
replied
to
him
I
am
the
same
as
you
and
my
people
are
the
same
as
your
people
and
will
support
you
in
the
war
4
But
Jehoshaphat
said
to
the
king
of
Israel
First
inquire
please
for
the
word
of
Jehovah
5
So
the
king
of
Israel
gathered
the
prophets
together
400
men
and
said
to
them
Should
we
go
to
war
against
Ramoth-gilead
or
should
I
refrain
They
said
Go
up
and
the
true
God
will
give
it
into
the
kings
hand
6
Jehoshaphat
then
said
Is
there
not
here
a
prophet
of
Jehovah
Let
us
also
inquire
through
him
7
At
that
the
king
of
Israel
said
to
Jehoshaphat
There
is
still
one
more
man
through
whom
we
can
inquire
of
Jehovah
but
I
hate
him
for
he
never
prophesies
good
things
concerning
me
but
always
bad
He
is
Micaiah
the
son
of
Imlah
However
Jehoshaphat
said
The
king
should
not
say
such
a
thing
8
So
the
king
of
Israel
called
a
court
official
and
said
Bring
Micaiah
the
son
of
Imlah
quickly
9
Now
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
were
each
sitting
on
his
throne
dressed
in
royal
attire
they
were
sitting
at
the
threshing
floor
at
the
entrance
of
the
gate
of
Samaria
and
all
the
prophets
were
prophesying
before
them
10
Then
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
made
for
himself
iron
horns
and
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
With
these
you
will
gore
the
Syrians
until
you
exterminate
them
11
All
the
other
prophets
were
prophesying
the
same
way
saying
Go
up
to
Ramoth-gilead
and
you
will
be
successful
Jehovah
will
give
it
into
the
kings
hand
12
So
the
messenger
who
went
to
call
Micaiah
said
to
him
Look
The
words
of
the
prophets
are
unanimously
favorable
to
the
king
Let
your
word
please
become
like
theirs
and
speak
favorably
13
But
Micaiah
said
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
living
whatever
my
God
says
is
what
I
will
speak
14
Then
he
came
in
to
the
king
and
the
king
asked
him
Micaiah
should
we
go
to
war
against
Ramoth-gilead
or
should
I
refrain
At
once
he
replied
Go
up
and
you
will
be
successful
they
will
be
given
into
your
hand
15
At
that
the
king
said
to
him
How
many
times
must
I
put
you
under
oath
not
to
speak
to
me
anything
but
the
truth
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
16
So
he
said
I
see
all
the
Israelites
scattered
on
the
mountains
like
sheep
that
have
no
shepherd
Jehovah
said
These
have
no
master
Let
each
one
go
back
to
his
house
in
peace
17
Then
the
king
of
Israel
said
to
Jehoshaphat
Did
I
not
tell
you
He
will
not
prophesy
good
things
concerning
me
only
bad
18
Micaiah
then
said
Therefore
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
I
saw
Jehovah
sitting
on
his
throne
and
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
standing
at
his
right
and
at
his
left
19
Jehovah
then
said
Who
will
fool
King
Ahab
of
Israel
so
that
he
will
go
up
and
fall
at
Ramoth-gilead
And
one
was
saying
one
thing
while
another
said
something
else
20
Then
a
spirit
came
forward
and
stood
before
Jehovah
and
said
I
will
fool
him
Jehovah
asked
him
How
will
you
do
it
21
He
replied
I
will
go
out
and
become
a
deceptive
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
So
he
said
You
will
fool
him
and
what
is
more
you
will
be
successful
Go
out
and
do
that
22
And
now
Jehovah
has
put
a
deceptive
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
these
prophets
of
yours
but
Jehovah
has
declared
calamity
for
you
23
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Chenaanah
now
approached
and
struck
Micaiah
on
the
cheek
and
said
Which
way
did
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
pass
from
me
to
speak
with
you
24
Micaiah
replied
Look
You
will
see
which
way
on
the
day
when
you
will
enter
the
innermost
room
to
hide
25
Then
the
king
of
Israel
said
Take
Micaiah
and
turn
him
over
to
Amon
the
chief
of
the
city
and
to
Joash
the
kings
son
26
Tell
them
This
is
what
the
king
says
Put
this
fellow
in
the
prison
and
feed
him
with
a
reduced
allowance
of
bread
and
water
until
I
return
in
peace
27
But
Micaiah
said
If
you
do
return
in
peace
Jehovah
has
not
spoken
with
me
Then
he
added
Take
note
all
you
peoples
28
So
the
king
of
Israel
and
Jehoshaphat
the
king
of
Judah
went
up
to
Ramoth-gilead
29
The
king
of
Israel
now
said
to
Jehoshaphat
I
will
disguise
myself
and
will
go
into
the
battle
but
you
should
put
on
your
royal
attire
So
the
king
of
Israel
disguised
himself
and
they
entered
the
battle
30
Now
the
king
of
Syria
had
ordered
his
chariot
commanders
Do
not
fight
with
anyone
small
or
great
except
the
king
of
Israel
31
And
as
soon
as
the
chariot
commanders
saw
Jehoshaphat
they
said
to
themselves
It
is
the
king
of
Israel
So
they
turned
to
fight
against
him
and
Jehoshaphat
began
to
cry
for
help
and
Jehovah
helped
him
and
God
at
once
diverted
them
from
him
32
When
the
chariot
commanders
saw
that
it
was
not
the
king
of
Israel
they
immediately
turned
back
from
following
him
33
But
one
man
shot
his
bow
at
random
and
he
struck
the
king
of
Israel
between
the
joints
of
his
coat
of
mail
So
the
king
said
to
his
charioteer
Turn
around
and
take
me
out
of
the
battle
for
I
have
been
badly
wounded
34
The
fighting
raged
throughout
that
day
and
the
king
of
Israel
had
to
be
propped
up
in
the
chariot
facing
the
Syrians
until
the
evening
and
he
died
at
sunset
1
Then
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Judah
returned
safely
to
his
own
house
in
Jerusalem
2
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
the
visionary
went
out
to
meet
him
and
said
to
King
Jehoshaphat
Is
it
the
wicked
you
should
be
helping
and
is
it
those
who
hate
Jehovah
you
should
love
Because
of
this
the
indignation
of
Jehovah
is
against
you
3
Nevertheless
there
are
good
things
that
have
been
found
in
you
because
you
cleared
out
the
sacred
poles
from
the
land
and
you
have
prepared
your
heart
to
search
for
the
true
God
4
Jehoshaphat
continued
living
in
Jerusalem
and
he
went
out
again
among
the
people
from
Beer-sheba
to
the
mountainous
region
of
Ephraim
to
bring
them
back
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
5
He
also
appointed
judges
throughout
the
land
in
all
the
fortified
cities
of
Judah
city
by
city
6
And
he
said
to
the
judges
Pay
attention
to
what
you
are
doing
for
you
do
not
judge
for
man
but
for
Jehovah
and
he
is
with
you
when
you
pass
judgment
7
Now
let
the
fear
of
Jehovah
be
upon
you
Be
careful
about
what
you
do
for
with
Jehovah
our
God
there
is
no
injustice
no
partiality
no
bribe-taking
8
In
Jerusalem
also
Jehoshaphat
appointed
some
of
the
Levites
and
the
priests
and
some
of
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
Israel
to
serve
as
judges
for
Jehovah
and
to
settle
legal
cases
for
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
9
And
he
commanded
them
This
is
what
you
should
do
in
the
fear
of
Jehovah
with
faithfulness
and
a
complete
heart
10
Whenever
your
brothers
living
in
their
cities
bring
a
legal
case
that
involves
the
shedding
of
blood
or
a
question
about
a
law
a
commandment
regulations
or
judgments
you
should
warn
them
so
that
they
may
not
become
guilty
before
Jehovah
otherwise
his
indignation
will
come
against
you
and
your
brothers
This
is
what
you
should
do
so
that
you
may
not
incur
guilt
11
Here
is
Amariah
the
chief
priest
who
is
over
you
for
every
matter
of
Jehovah
Zebadiah
the
son
of
Ishmael
is
the
leader
of
the
house
of
Judah
for
every
matter
pertaining
to
the
king
And
the
Levites
will
serve
as
officers
for
you
Be
strong
and
act
and
let
Jehovah
be
with
those
who
do
what
is
good
1
Afterward
the
Moabites
and
the
Ammonites
together
with
some
of
the
Ammonim
came
to
wage
war
against
Jehoshaphat
2
So
Jehoshaphat
was
told
A
large
crowd
has
come
against
you
from
the
region
of
the
sea
from
Edom
and
there
they
are
in
Hazazon-tamar
that
is
En-gedi
3
At
that
Jehoshaphat
became
afraid
and
he
resolved
to
search
for
Jehovah
So
he
proclaimed
a
fast
for
all
Judah
4
The
people
of
Judah
then
gathered
together
to
inquire
of
Jehovah
they
came
from
all
the
cities
of
Judah
to
consult
Jehovah
5
Then
Jehoshaphat
stood
up
in
the
congregation
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
before
the
new
courtyard
6
and
he
said
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
our
forefathers
are
you
not
God
in
the
heavens
do
you
not
have
dominion
over
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
nations
In
your
hand
are
power
and
might
and
no
one
can
stand
against
you
7
O
our
God
did
you
not
drive
away
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
from
before
your
people
Israel
and
then
give
it
as
a
lasting
possession
to
the
offspring
of
your
friend
Abraham
8
And
they
settled
in
it
and
they
built
for
you
there
a
sanctuary
for
your
name
saying
9
If
disaster
should
come
on
us
whether
by
sword
adverse
judgment
pestilence
or
famine
let
us
stand
before
this
house
and
before
you
for
your
name
is
in
this
house
and
call
to
you
for
help
out
of
our
distress
and
may
you
hear
and
save
us
10
Now
here
are
the
men
of
Ammon
Moab
and
the
mountainous
region
of
Seir
whom
you
did
not
allow
Israel
to
invade
when
they
came
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
They
turned
away
from
them
and
did
not
annihilate
them
11
Now
they
are
repaying
us
by
coming
in
to
drive
us
out
from
your
possession
that
you
gave
us
as
an
inheritance
12
O
our
God
will
you
not
execute
judgment
on
them
For
we
are
powerless
before
this
large
crowd
that
is
coming
against
us
and
we
do
not
know
what
we
should
do
but
our
eyes
are
toward
you
13
Meanwhile
all
those
of
Judah
were
standing
before
Jehovah
along
with
their
little
ones
their
wives
and
their
children
14
Then
in
the
middle
of
the
congregation
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
came
upon
Jahaziel
son
of
Zechariah
son
of
Benaiah
son
of
Jeiel
son
of
Mattaniah
the
Levite
of
the
sons
of
Asaph
15
He
said
Pay
attention
all
Judah
and
you
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
and
King
Jehoshaphat
Here
is
what
Jehovah
says
to
you
Do
not
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
because
of
this
large
crowd
for
the
battle
is
not
yours
but
Gods
16
Tomorrow
go
down
against
them
They
will
be
coming
up
by
the
pass
of
Ziz
and
you
will
find
them
at
the
end
of
the
valley
before
the
wilderness
of
Jeruel
17
You
will
not
need
to
fight
this
battle
Take
your
position
stand
still
and
see
the
salvation
of
Jehovah
in
your
behalf
O
Judah
and
Jerusalem
do
not
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
Tomorrow
go
out
against
them
and
Jehovah
will
be
with
you
18
At
once
Jehoshaphat
bowed
low
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
all
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
fell
down
before
Jehovah
to
worship
Jehovah
19
Then
the
Levites
who
were
descendants
of
the
Kohathites
and
the
Korahites
rose
up
to
praise
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
with
a
very
loud
voice
20
They
rose
up
early
the
next
morning
and
went
out
to
the
wilderness
of
Tekoa
As
they
went
out
Jehoshaphat
stood
up
and
said
Listen
to
me
O
Judah
and
you
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
Put
faith
in
Jehovah
your
God
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
stand
firm
Put
faith
in
his
prophets
and
you
will
be
successful
21
After
he
consulted
with
the
people
he
appointed
men
to
sing
to
Jehovah
and
to
offer
praise
in
holy
adornment
as
they
went
out
ahead
of
the
armed
men
saying
Give
thanks
to
Jehovah
for
his
loyal
love
endures
forever
22
When
they
began
joyfully
singing
praises
Jehovah
set
an
ambush
against
the
men
of
Ammon
Moab
and
the
mountainous
region
of
Seir
who
were
invading
Judah
and
they
struck
each
other
down
23
And
the
Ammonites
and
the
Moabites
turned
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
mountainous
region
of
Seir
to
destroy
and
annihilate
them
and
when
they
finished
with
the
inhabitants
of
Seir
they
helped
to
destroy
one
another
24
But
when
Judah
came
to
the
watchtower
of
the
wilderness
and
looked
toward
the
crowd
there
they
saw
their
carcasses
fallen
to
the
ground
there
were
no
survivors
25
So
Jehoshaphat
and
his
people
came
to
carry
off
the
spoil
from
them
and
they
found
among
them
an
abundance
of
goods
clothing
and
desirable
articles
which
they
stripped
off
for
themselves
until
they
could
carry
no
more
It
took
three
days
to
carry
off
the
spoil
for
it
was
abundant
26
On
the
fourth
day
they
congregated
together
at
the
Valley
of
Beracah
for
there
they
praised
Jehovah
That
is
why
they
named
that
place
Valley
of
Beracah—until
today
27
Then
all
the
men
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
with
Jehoshaphat
at
their
head
returned
to
Jerusalem
with
rejoicing
for
Jehovah
had
made
them
rejoice
over
their
enemies
28
So
they
came
into
Jerusalem
with
stringed
instruments
harps
and
trumpets
and
went
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
29
And
the
dread
of
God
came
upon
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
lands
when
they
heard
that
Jehovah
had
fought
against
the
enemies
of
Israel
30
Thus
the
kingdom
of
Jehoshaphat
had
no
disturbance
and
his
God
continued
to
give
him
rest
on
every
side
31
And
Jehoshaphat
continued
reigning
over
Judah
He
was
35
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
25
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Azubah
the
daughter
of
Shilhi
32
He
kept
walking
in
the
way
of
his
father
Asa
He
did
not
deviate
from
it
and
he
did
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
33
However
the
high
places
were
not
removed
and
the
people
had
not
yet
prepared
their
heart
for
the
God
of
their
forefathers
34
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehoshaphat
from
beginning
to
end
there
it
is
written
among
the
words
of
Jehu
the
son
of
Hanani
which
were
included
in
the
Book
of
the
Kings
of
Israel
35
After
this
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Judah
made
an
alliance
with
King
Ahaziah
of
Israel
who
acted
wickedly
36
So
he
made
him
his
partner
in
making
ships
to
go
to
Tarshish
and
they
built
the
ships
in
Ezion-geber
37
However
Eliezer
the
son
of
Dodavahu
of
Maresha
spoke
prophetically
against
Jehoshaphat
saying
Because
you
have
made
an
alliance
with
Ahaziah
Jehovah
will
destroy
your
works
So
the
ships
were
wrecked
and
they
were
unable
to
go
to
Tarshish
1
Then
Jehoshaphat
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
was
buried
with
his
forefathers
in
the
City
of
David
and
his
son
Jehoram
became
king
in
his
place
2
His
brothers
Jehoshaphats
sons
were
Azariah
Jehiel
Zechariah
Azariah
Michael
and
Shephatiah
all
of
these
were
the
sons
of
King
Jehoshaphat
of
Israel
3
And
their
father
had
given
them
many
gifts
in
silver
and
gold
and
valuable
things
along
with
fortified
cities
in
Judah
but
he
gave
the
kingdom
to
Jehoram
for
he
was
the
firstborn
4
When
Jehoram
had
taken
control
of
the
kingdom
of
his
father
he
strengthened
his
position
by
killing
all
his
brothers
with
the
sword
as
well
as
some
of
the
princes
of
Israel
5
Jehoram
was
32
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
eight
years
in
Jerusalem
6
He
walked
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
Israel
just
as
those
of
the
house
of
Ahab
had
done
for
Ahabs
daughter
had
become
his
wife
and
he
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
7
But
Jehovah
did
not
want
to
bring
the
house
of
David
to
ruin
for
the
sake
of
the
covenant
that
he
had
made
with
David
since
he
had
promised
to
give
a
lamp
to
him
and
to
his
sons
always
8
In
his
days
Edom
revolted
against
Judah
and
then
set
up
its
own
king
9
So
Jehoram
and
his
commanders
crossed
over
with
all
his
chariots
and
he
rose
up
by
night
and
defeated
the
Edomites
who
were
surrounding
him
and
the
chariot
commanders
10
But
Edom
has
kept
up
its
revolt
against
Judah
to
this
day
Libnah
also
revolted
against
him
at
that
time
because
he
had
abandoned
Jehovah
the
God
of
his
forefathers
11
He
had
also
made
high
places
on
the
mountains
of
Judah
to
cause
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
to
commit
spiritual
prostitution
and
he
led
Judah
astray
12
Eventually
a
written
message
came
to
him
from
Elijah
the
prophet
saying
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
David
your
forefather
says
You
have
not
walked
in
the
ways
of
your
father
Jehoshaphat
or
in
the
ways
of
King
Asa
of
Judah
13
But
you
walk
in
the
way
of
the
kings
of
Israel
and
cause
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
to
commit
spiritual
prostitution
like
the
prostitution
of
the
house
of
Ahab
and
you
even
killed
your
own
brothers
the
household
of
your
father
who
were
better
than
you
14
Therefore
Jehovah
is
dealing
a
great
blow
to
your
people
to
your
sons
to
your
wives
and
to
all
your
possessions
15
And
you
will
suffer
with
many
sicknesses
including
a
disease
of
your
intestines
until
your
intestines
come
out
because
of
the
disease
day
after
day
16
Then
Jehovah
stirred
up
against
Jehoram
the
Philistines
and
the
Arabs
who
were
near
the
Ethiopians
17
So
they
invaded
Judah
forcing
their
way
in
and
carried
off
all
the
possessions
that
were
found
in
the
kings
house
as
well
as
his
sons
and
his
wives
and
the
only
son
left
to
him
was
Jehoahaz
his
youngest
son
18
And
after
all
of
this
Jehovah
afflicted
him
with
an
incurable
disease
in
his
intestines
19
Some
time
later
when
two
full
years
had
passed
his
intestines
came
out
because
of
his
disease
and
he
died
while
suffering
severely
from
his
disease
and
his
people
did
not
make
a
burning
for
him
like
the
burning
that
was
made
for
his
forefathers
20
He
was
32
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
eight
years
in
Jerusalem
No
one
regretted
it
when
he
died
So
they
buried
him
in
the
City
of
David
but
not
in
the
burial
places
of
the
kings
1
Then
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
made
his
youngest
son
Ahaziah
king
in
his
place
for
the
marauder
band
that
came
with
the
Arabs
to
the
camp
had
killed
all
the
older
ones
So
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Jehoram
began
to
reign
as
king
of
Judah
2
Ahaziah
was
22
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
one
year
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Athaliah
the
granddaughter
of
Omri
3
He
too
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
house
of
Ahab
for
his
mother
became
his
adviser
in
acting
wickedly
4
And
he
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
like
the
house
of
Ahab
for
they
became
his
advisers
after
the
death
of
his
father
to
his
destruction
5
He
followed
their
advice
and
went
with
Jehoram
the
son
of
King
Ahab
of
Israel
to
wage
war
against
King
Hazael
of
Syria
at
Ramoth-gilead
where
the
archers
wounded
Jehoram
6
He
returned
to
Jezreel
to
recover
from
the
wounds
that
they
had
inflicted
on
him
at
Ramah
when
he
fought
against
King
Hazael
of
Syria
Ahaziah
the
son
of
Jehoram
the
king
of
Judah
went
down
to
Jezreel
to
see
Jehoram
the
son
of
Ahab
because
he
had
been
wounded
7
But
God
brought
about
the
downfall
of
Ahaziah
by
his
coming
to
Jehoram
and
when
he
came
he
went
out
with
Jehoram
to
meet
Jehu
the
grandson
of
Nimshi
whom
Jehovah
had
anointed
to
do
away
with
the
house
of
Ahab
8
When
Jehu
began
to
execute
judgment
on
the
house
of
Ahab
he
found
the
princes
of
Judah
and
the
sons
of
Ahaziahs
brothers
ministers
of
Ahaziah
and
he
killed
them
9
Then
he
looked
for
Ahaziah
they
captured
him
where
he
was
hiding
in
Samaria
and
they
brought
him
to
Jehu
Then
they
put
him
to
death
and
buried
him
for
they
said
He
is
the
grandson
of
Jehoshaphat
who
searched
for
Jehovah
with
all
his
heart
There
was
no
one
of
the
house
of
Ahaziah
who
had
the
power
to
rule
the
kingdom
10
When
Athaliah
Ahaziahs
mother
saw
that
her
son
had
died
she
rose
up
and
destroyed
the
entire
royal
line
of
the
house
of
Judah
11
However
Jehoshabeath
the
daughter
of
the
king
took
Jehoash
the
son
of
Ahaziah
and
stole
him
away
from
among
the
sons
of
the
king
who
were
to
be
put
to
death
and
she
put
him
and
his
nurse
in
an
inner
bedroom
Jehoshabeath
the
daughter
of
King
Jehoram
she
was
the
wife
of
Jehoiada
the
priest
and
a
sister
of
Ahaziah
managed
to
keep
him
concealed
from
Athaliah
so
that
she
did
not
put
him
to
death
12
He
remained
with
them
for
six
years
hidden
at
the
house
of
the
true
God
while
Athaliah
was
ruling
over
the
land
1
In
the
seventh
year
Jehoiada
acted
courageously
and
made
a
pact
with
the
chiefs
of
hundreds
namely
Azariah
the
son
of
Jeroham
Ishmael
the
son
of
Jehohanan
Azariah
the
son
of
Obed
Maaseiah
the
son
of
Adaiah
and
Elishaphat
the
son
of
Zichri
2
Then
they
went
throughout
Judah
and
gathered
together
the
Levites
from
all
the
cities
of
Judah
and
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
Israel
When
they
came
to
Jerusalem
3
the
entire
congregation
made
a
covenant
with
the
king
in
the
house
of
the
true
God
after
which
he
said
to
them
Look
The
kings
son
will
reign
just
as
Jehovah
promised
concerning
the
sons
of
David
4
This
is
what
you
are
to
do
One
third
of
the
priests
and
of
the
Levites
who
will
be
on
duty
on
the
Sabbath
will
be
doorkeepers
5
another
third
will
be
at
the
house
of
the
king
and
the
other
third
will
be
at
the
Gate
of
the
Foundation
and
all
the
people
will
be
in
the
courtyards
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
6
Do
not
let
anyone
enter
the
house
of
Jehovah
except
the
priests
and
the
Levites
who
are
ministering
These
may
enter
because
they
are
a
holy
group
and
all
the
people
will
keep
the
obligation
to
Jehovah
7
The
Levites
must
surround
the
king
on
every
side
each
with
his
weapons
in
hand
Anyone
entering
the
house
will
be
put
to
death
Stay
with
the
king
wherever
he
goes
8
The
Levites
and
all
Judah
did
exactly
what
Jehoiada
the
priest
had
commanded
So
each
one
took
his
men
who
were
on
duty
on
the
Sabbath
together
with
those
who
were
off
duty
on
the
Sabbath
for
Jehoiada
the
priest
had
not
dismissed
the
divisions
from
their
duty
9
Jehoiada
the
priest
then
gave
the
chiefs
of
hundreds
the
spears
and
the
bucklers
and
the
circular
shields
that
had
belonged
to
King
David
which
were
in
the
house
of
the
true
God
10
He
then
stationed
all
the
people
each
with
his
weapon
in
hand
from
the
right
side
of
the
house
to
the
left
side
of
the
house
by
the
altar
and
by
the
house
all
around
the
king
11
Then
they
brought
the
kings
son
out
and
put
on
him
the
crown
and
the
Testimony
and
made
him
king
and
Jehoiada
and
his
sons
anointed
him
Then
they
said
Long
live
the
king
12
When
Athaliah
heard
the
sound
of
the
people
running
and
praising
the
king
she
immediately
came
to
the
people
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
13
Then
she
saw
the
king
standing
there
by
his
pillar
at
the
entrance
The
princes
and
the
trumpeters
were
with
the
king
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
were
rejoicing
and
blowing
the
trumpets
and
the
singers
with
musical
instruments
were
leading
the
praises
At
this
Athaliah
ripped
her
garments
apart
and
cried
out
Conspiracy
Conspiracy
14
But
Jehoiada
the
priest
brought
out
the
chiefs
of
hundreds
those
appointed
over
the
army
and
said
to
them
Take
her
out
from
among
the
ranks
and
if
anyone
follows
her
put
him
to
death
with
the
sword
For
the
priest
had
said
Do
not
put
her
to
death
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
15
So
they
seized
her
and
when
she
reached
the
entrance
of
the
Horse
Gate
of
the
kings
house
they
immediately
put
her
to
death
there
16
Then
Jehoiada
made
a
covenant
between
himself
and
all
the
people
and
the
king
that
they
would
continue
as
the
people
of
Jehovah
17
After
that
all
the
people
came
to
the
house
of
Baal
and
tore
it
down
and
they
smashed
his
altars
and
his
images
and
they
killed
Mattan
the
priest
of
Baal
in
front
of
the
altars
18
Then
Jehoiada
put
the
oversight
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
the
hands
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites
whom
David
had
assigned
in
divisions
over
the
house
of
Jehovah
to
offer
up
the
burnt
sacrifices
of
Jehovah
according
to
what
is
written
in
the
Law
of
Moses
with
rejoicing
and
with
song
as
directed
by
David
19
He
also
stationed
the
gatekeepers
by
the
gates
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
so
that
no
one
unclean
in
any
respect
could
enter
20
He
now
took
the
chiefs
of
hundreds
the
nobles
the
rulers
of
the
people
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
escorted
the
king
down
from
the
house
of
Jehovah
Then
they
came
through
the
upper
gate
to
the
kings
house
and
seated
the
king
on
the
throne
of
the
kingdom
21
So
all
the
people
of
the
land
rejoiced
and
the
city
was
quiet
for
they
had
put
Athaliah
to
death
with
the
sword
1
Jehoash
was
seven
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
40
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Zibiah
from
Beer-sheba
2
Jehoash
continued
doing
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
all
the
days
of
Jehoiada
the
priest
3
Jehoiada
chose
two
wives
for
him
and
he
became
father
to
sons
and
daughters
4
Afterward
it
was
the
hearts
desire
of
Jehoash
to
renovate
the
house
of
Jehovah
5
So
he
gathered
the
priests
and
the
Levites
together
and
said
to
them
Go
out
to
the
cities
of
Judah
and
collect
money
from
all
Israel
to
repair
the
house
of
your
God
from
year
to
year
and
you
should
act
quickly
in
the
matter
But
the
Levites
did
not
act
quickly
6
So
the
king
called
Jehoiada
the
chief
and
said
to
him
Why
have
you
not
required
the
Levites
to
bring
in
from
Judah
and
Jerusalem
the
sacred
tax
ordered
by
Moses
the
servant
of
Jehovah
the
sacred
tax
of
the
congregation
of
Israel
for
the
tent
of
the
Testimony
7
For
the
sons
of
Athaliah
that
wicked
woman
had
broken
into
the
house
of
the
true
God
and
they
had
used
all
the
holy
things
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
for
the
Baals
8
Then
at
the
kings
order
a
chest
was
made
and
placed
outside
at
the
gate
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
9
After
that
a
proclamation
was
issued
throughout
Judah
and
Jerusalem
to
bring
to
Jehovah
the
sacred
tax
that
Moses
the
servant
of
the
true
God
had
imposed
on
Israel
in
the
wilderness
10
All
the
princes
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
and
they
kept
bringing
contributions
and
dropping
them
into
the
chest
until
it
was
full
11
Whenever
the
Levites
brought
the
chest
in
to
be
turned
over
to
the
king
and
they
saw
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
money
in
it
the
secretary
of
the
king
and
the
commissioner
of
the
chief
priest
would
come
and
empty
the
chest
and
then
they
would
take
it
back
to
its
place
That
was
what
they
did
from
day
to
day
and
they
gathered
money
in
abundance
12
Then
the
king
and
Jehoiada
would
give
it
to
those
supervising
the
work
of
the
service
of
Jehovahs
house
and
they
would
hire
the
stonecutters
and
the
craftsmen
for
renovating
Jehovahs
house
and
also
workers
in
iron
and
copper
to
repair
Jehovahs
house
13
And
those
supervising
the
work
got
it
started
and
the
repair
work
progressed
under
their
supervision
and
they
restored
the
house
of
the
true
God
to
its
proper
condition
and
reinforced
it
14
And
as
soon
as
they
finished
they
brought
the
money
that
was
left
over
to
the
king
and
Jehoiada
and
they
used
it
to
make
utensils
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
utensils
for
the
ministry
and
for
making
offerings
and
cups
and
utensils
of
gold
and
of
silver
And
they
would
offer
up
burnt
sacrifices
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
regularly
all
the
days
of
Jehoiada
15
When
Jehoiada
was
old
and
satisfied
with
years
he
died
he
was
130
years
old
at
his
death
16
So
they
buried
him
in
the
City
of
David
along
with
the
kings
because
he
had
done
good
in
Israel
with
respect
to
the
true
God
and
His
house
17
After
Jehoiadas
death
the
princes
of
Judah
came
and
bowed
down
to
the
king
and
the
king
listened
to
them
18
They
abandoned
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
and
began
serving
the
sacred
poles
and
the
idols
so
that
Gods
anger
came
against
Judah
and
Jerusalem
because
of
their
guilt
19
He
kept
sending
prophets
among
them
to
bring
them
back
to
Jehovah
and
they
kept
warning
them
but
they
refused
to
listen
20
Gods
spirit
came
upon
Zechariah
the
son
of
Jehoiada
the
priest
and
he
stood
above
the
people
and
said
to
them
This
is
what
the
true
God
says
Why
are
you
violating
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
You
will
not
be
successful
Because
you
have
abandoned
Jehovah
he
will
in
turn
abandon
you
21
But
they
conspired
against
him
and
stoned
him
at
the
kings
order
in
the
courtyard
of
Jehovahs
house
22
Thus
King
Jehoash
did
not
remember
the
loyal
love
that
his
father
Jehoiada
had
shown
toward
him
and
he
killed
his
son
who
said
as
he
was
dying
May
Jehovah
see
to
it
and
call
you
to
account
23
At
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
Syrian
army
came
up
against
Jehoash
and
they
invaded
Judah
and
Jerusalem
Then
they
did
away
with
all
the
princes
of
the
people
and
they
sent
all
their
spoil
to
the
king
of
Damascus
24
For
although
the
invading
Syrian
army
had
a
small
number
of
men
Jehovah
handed
over
to
them
a
very
large
army
because
they
had
abandoned
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
so
they
executed
judgment
on
Jehoash
25
And
when
they
withdrew
from
him
for
they
left
him
severely
wounded
his
own
servants
conspired
against
him
because
he
had
shed
the
blood
of
the
sons
of
Jehoiada
the
priest
They
killed
him
on
his
own
bed
So
he
died
and
they
buried
him
in
the
City
of
David
but
they
did
not
bury
him
in
the
burial
places
of
the
kings
26
These
were
the
conspirators
against
him
Zabad
the
son
of
Shimeath
the
Ammonitess
and
Jehozabad
the
son
of
Shimrith
the
Moabitess
27
Regarding
his
sons
and
the
many
pronouncements
against
him
and
the
renovation
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
all
these
things
are
recorded
in
the
writings
of
the
Book
of
the
Kings
And
his
son
Amaziah
became
king
in
his
place
1
Amaziah
was
25
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
29
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Jehoaddan
of
Jerusalem
2
He
continued
to
do
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
but
not
with
a
complete
heart
3
As
soon
as
he
had
the
kingdom
firmly
in
his
control
he
killed
his
servants
who
had
killed
his
father
the
king
4
But
he
did
not
put
their
sons
to
death
for
he
acted
in
harmony
with
what
is
written
in
the
Law
in
the
book
of
Moses
where
Jehovah
commanded
Fathers
should
not
die
for
their
sons
and
sons
should
not
die
for
their
fathers
but
each
one
should
die
for
his
own
sin
5
And
Amaziah
gathered
Judah
together
and
had
them
stand
according
to
the
paternal
houses
by
the
chiefs
of
thousands
and
by
the
chiefs
of
hundreds
for
all
Judah
and
Benjamin
He
registered
them
from
20
years
old
and
up
and
he
found
them
to
be
300000
trained
warriors
to
serve
in
the
army
able
to
handle
the
lance
and
the
large
shield
6
Further
he
hired
from
Israel
100000
mighty
warriors
for
100
silver
talents
7
But
a
man
of
the
true
God
came
to
him
saying
O
king
do
not
let
the
army
of
Israel
go
with
you
for
Jehovah
is
not
with
Israel
not
with
any
of
the
Ephraimites
8
But
go
by
yourself
act
and
be
courageous
in
battle
Otherwise
the
true
God
could
cause
you
to
stumble
before
an
enemy
for
God
has
the
power
to
help
and
to
cause
stumbling
9
At
this
Amaziah
said
to
the
man
of
the
true
God
But
what
about
the
100
talents
that
I
have
given
to
the
troops
of
Israel
The
man
of
the
true
God
replied
Jehovah
has
the
means
to
give
you
much
more
than
that
10
So
Amaziah
dismissed
the
troops
that
had
come
to
him
from
Ephraim
sending
them
to
their
own
place
However
they
were
very
angry
with
Judah
so
they
returned
to
their
own
place
in
the
heat
of
anger
11
Then
Amaziah
took
courage
and
led
his
own
troops
to
the
Valley
of
Salt
and
he
struck
down
10000
men
of
Seir
12
And
the
men
of
Judah
captured
10000
alive
So
they
brought
them
to
the
top
of
the
crag
and
threw
them
down
from
the
top
of
the
crag
and
they
were
all
dashed
to
pieces
13
But
the
members
of
the
troop
whom
Amaziah
had
sent
back
from
accompanying
him
to
the
war
were
making
raids
on
the
cities
of
Judah
from
Samaria
clear
to
Beth-horon
they
struck
down
3000
of
them
and
took
much
spoil
14
But
after
Amaziah
returned
from
striking
down
the
Edomites
he
brought
the
gods
of
the
men
of
Seir
and
set
them
up
for
himself
as
gods
and
he
began
to
bow
down
before
them
and
to
make
sacrificial
smoke
to
them
15
So
Jehovah
grew
very
angry
with
Amaziah
and
he
sent
a
prophet
who
said
to
him
Why
are
you
following
the
peoples
gods
that
did
not
rescue
their
own
people
out
of
your
hand
16
As
he
spoke
to
him
the
king
said
Did
we
appoint
you
as
an
adviser
to
the
king
Stop
Why
should
they
strike
you
down
Then
the
prophet
quit
but
he
added
I
know
that
God
has
decided
to
bring
you
to
ruin
because
you
have
done
this
and
you
have
not
listened
to
my
advice
17
After
consulting
with
his
advisers
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
sent
a
message
to
Jehoash
son
of
Jehoahaz
son
of
Jehu
the
king
of
Israel
saying
Come
Let
us
confront
each
other
in
battle
18
King
Jehoash
of
Israel
sent
this
message
to
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
The
thorny
weed
in
Lebanon
sent
a
message
to
the
cedar
in
Lebanon
Give
your
daughter
to
my
son
as
a
wife
However
a
wild
beast
of
Lebanon
passed
by
and
trampled
down
the
thorny
weed
19
You
have
said
Look
I
have
struck
down
Edom
So
your
heart
has
become
arrogant
wanting
to
be
glorified
But
now
stay
in
your
own
house
Why
should
you
provoke
disaster
and
fall
bringing
Judah
down
with
you
20
But
Amaziah
did
not
listen
for
this
was
from
the
true
God
to
give
them
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
because
they
had
followed
the
gods
of
Edom
21
So
King
Jehoash
of
Israel
went
up
and
he
and
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
confronted
each
other
in
battle
at
Beth-shemesh
which
belongs
to
Judah
22
Judah
was
defeated
by
Israel
so
each
one
fled
to
his
home
23
King
Jehoash
of
Israel
captured
King
Amaziah
of
Judah
son
of
Jehoash
son
of
Jehoahaz
at
Beth-shemesh
Then
he
brought
him
to
Jerusalem
and
made
a
breach
in
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
from
the
Gate
of
Ephraim
to
the
Corner
Gate
400
cubits
24
He
took
all
the
gold
and
the
silver
and
all
the
articles
that
were
found
in
the
house
of
the
true
God
with
Obed-edom
and
in
the
treasuries
of
the
kings
house
as
well
as
hostages
Then
he
returned
to
Samaria
25
Amaziah
the
son
of
Jehoash
the
king
of
Judah
lived
for
15
years
after
the
death
of
Jehoash
the
son
of
Jehoahaz
the
king
of
Israel
26
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Amaziah
from
beginning
to
end
look
is
it
not
written
in
the
Book
of
the
Kings
of
Judah
and
of
Israel
27
From
the
time
that
Amaziah
turned
away
from
following
Jehovah
they
formed
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
Jerusalem
and
he
fled
to
Lachish
but
they
sent
men
after
him
to
Lachish
and
put
him
to
death
there
28
So
they
carried
him
back
on
horses
and
buried
him
with
his
forefathers
in
the
city
of
Judah
1
Then
all
the
people
of
Judah
took
Uzziah
who
was
16
years
old
and
made
him
king
in
place
of
his
father
Amaziah
2
He
rebuilt
Eloth
and
restored
it
to
Judah
after
the
king
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
3
Uzziah
was
16
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
52
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Jecoliah
of
Jerusalem
4
He
continued
to
do
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
just
as
his
father
Amaziah
had
done
5
And
he
kept
searching
for
God
in
the
days
of
Zechariah
who
taught
him
to
fear
the
true
God
During
the
time
he
was
searching
for
Jehovah
the
true
God
made
him
prosper
6
He
went
out
and
fought
against
the
Philistines
and
broke
through
the
wall
of
Gath
the
wall
of
Jabneh
and
the
wall
of
Ashdod
Then
he
built
cities
in
the
territory
of
Ashdod
and
among
the
Philistines
7
The
true
God
continued
to
help
him
against
the
Philistines
against
the
Arabians
who
were
dwelling
in
Gurbaal
and
against
the
Meunim
8
The
Ammonites
began
to
give
tribute
to
Uzziah
His
fame
eventually
spread
as
far
as
Egypt
for
he
became
extremely
powerful
9
Moreover
Uzziah
built
towers
in
Jerusalem
by
the
Corner
Gate
the
Valley
Gate
and
the
Buttress
and
he
fortified
them
10
Further
he
built
towers
in
the
wilderness
and
dug
many
cisterns
for
he
had
a
great
deal
of
livestock
he
also
did
so
in
the
Shephelah
and
on
the
plain
He
had
farmers
and
vinedressers
in
the
mountains
and
in
Carmel
for
he
loved
agriculture
11
Moreover
Uzziah
came
to
have
an
army
equipped
for
war
They
would
go
out
on
military
campaigns
organized
in
divisions
They
were
numbered
and
registered
by
Jeiel
the
secretary
and
Maaseiah
the
officer
under
the
command
of
Hananiah
one
of
the
kings
princes
12
The
entire
number
of
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
who
were
over
these
mighty
warriors
was
2600
13
The
armed
forces
under
their
command
numbered
307500
men
ready
for
war
a
powerful
military
force
to
support
the
king
against
the
enemy
14
Uzziah
equipped
the
entire
army
with
shields
lances
helmets
coats
of
mail
bows
and
slingstones
15
Further
in
Jerusalem
he
made
engines
of
war
designed
by
engineers
they
were
set
on
the
towers
and
on
the
corners
of
the
walls
and
could
shoot
arrows
and
large
stones
So
his
fame
spread
far
and
wide
for
he
received
tremendous
help
and
he
became
strong
16
However
as
soon
as
he
was
strong
his
heart
became
haughty
to
his
own
ruin
and
he
acted
unfaithfully
against
Jehovah
his
God
by
entering
the
temple
of
Jehovah
to
burn
incense
on
the
altar
of
incense
17
Immediately
Azariah
the
priest
and
80
other
courageous
priests
of
Jehovah
went
in
after
him
18
They
confronted
King
Uzziah
and
said
to
him
It
is
not
proper
for
you
Uzziah
to
burn
incense
to
Jehovah
It
is
only
the
priests
who
should
burn
incense
for
they
are
the
descendants
of
Aaron
those
who
have
been
sanctified
Go
out
from
the
sanctuary
for
you
have
acted
unfaithfully
and
you
will
receive
no
glory
from
Jehovah
God
for
this
19
But
Uzziah
who
had
a
censer
in
his
hand
to
burn
incense
became
enraged
and
during
his
rage
against
the
priests
leprosy
broke
out
on
his
forehead
in
the
presence
of
the
priests
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
next
to
the
altar
of
incense
20
When
Azariah
the
chief
priest
and
all
the
priests
turned
toward
him
they
saw
that
he
had
been
stricken
with
leprosy
in
his
forehead
So
they
rushed
him
out
of
there
and
he
himself
hurried
out
because
Jehovah
had
struck
him
21
King
Uzziah
remained
a
leper
until
the
day
of
his
death
and
he
kept
staying
in
a
separate
house
as
a
leper
for
he
had
been
excluded
from
the
house
of
Jehovah
His
son
Jotham
was
in
charge
of
the
kings
house
judging
the
people
of
the
land
22
And
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Uzziah
from
beginning
to
end
was
recorded
by
the
prophet
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
23
Then
Uzziah
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
with
his
forefathers
but
in
the
burial
field
that
belonged
to
the
kings
for
they
said
He
is
a
leper
And
his
son
Jotham
became
king
in
his
place
1
Jotham
was
25
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
16
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Jerushah
the
daughter
of
Zadok
2
He
kept
doing
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
just
as
his
father
Uzziah
had
done
except
that
he
did
not
invade
the
temple
of
Jehovah
But
the
people
were
still
acting
ruinously
3
He
built
the
upper
gate
of
Jehovahs
house
and
he
did
much
building
on
the
wall
of
Ophel
4
He
also
built
cities
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Judah
and
he
built
fortified
places
and
towers
in
the
wooded
areas
5
He
waged
war
against
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
and
eventually
prevailed
against
them
so
that
the
Ammonites
gave
him
in
that
year
100
silver
talents
10000
cor
measures
of
wheat
and
10000
of
barley
The
Ammonites
also
paid
this
to
him
in
the
second
and
third
years
6
So
Jotham
kept
growing
strong
for
he
established
his
ways
before
Jehovah
his
God
7
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jotham
all
his
wars
and
his
ways
it
is
written
in
the
Book
of
the
Kings
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
8
He
was
25
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
16
years
in
Jerusalem
9
Then
Jotham
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
City
of
David
And
his
son
Ahaz
became
king
in
his
place
1
Ahaz
was
20
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
16
years
in
Jerusalem
He
did
not
do
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
as
David
his
forefather
had
done
2
Instead
he
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
kings
of
Israel
and
he
even
made
metal
statues
of
the
Baals
3
Moreover
he
made
sacrificial
smoke
in
the
Valley
of
the
Son
of
Hinnom
and
burned
up
his
sons
in
the
fire
following
the
detestable
practices
of
the
nations
that
Jehovah
had
driven
out
from
before
the
Israelites
4
He
also
kept
sacrificing
and
making
sacrificial
smoke
on
the
high
places
on
the
hills
and
under
every
luxuriant
tree
5
So
Jehovah
his
God
gave
him
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Syria
so
that
they
defeated
him
and
carried
off
a
great
number
of
captives
and
brought
them
to
Damascus
He
was
also
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Israel
who
inflicted
on
him
a
great
slaughter
6
For
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
killed
in
Judah
120000
in
one
day
all
brave
men
because
they
had
abandoned
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
7
And
Zichri
an
Ephraimite
warrior
killed
the
kings
son
Maaseiah
and
Azrikam
who
was
in
charge
of
the
palace
and
Elkanah
who
was
second
to
the
king
8
Moreover
the
Israelites
took
200000
of
their
brothers
captive—women
sons
and
daughters
they
also
seized
a
great
deal
of
spoil
and
they
took
the
spoil
to
Samaria
9
But
a
prophet
of
Jehovah
named
Oded
was
there
He
went
out
before
the
army
that
was
coming
to
Samaria
and
said
to
them
Look
It
was
because
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
was
angry
with
Judah
that
he
gave
them
into
your
hand
and
you
slaughtered
them
with
a
fury
that
has
reached
clear
to
the
heavens
10
And
now
you
intend
to
make
the
people
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
your
male
and
female
servants
Nevertheless
are
you
not
also
guilty
before
Jehovah
your
God
11
Now
listen
to
me
and
return
the
captives
whom
you
took
from
your
brothers
for
Jehovahs
burning
anger
is
against
you
12
At
that
some
of
the
chiefs
of
the
Ephraimites
Azariah
the
son
of
Jehohanan
Berechiah
the
son
of
Meshillemoth
Jehizkiah
the
son
of
Shallum
and
Amasa
the
son
of
Hadlai
confronted
those
coming
in
from
the
military
campaign
13
and
they
said
to
them
Do
not
bring
the
captives
in
here
for
it
will
make
us
guilty
before
Jehovah
What
you
intend
to
do
will
add
to
our
sins
and
to
our
guilt
for
our
guilt
is
already
great
and
there
is
burning
anger
against
Israel
14
So
the
armed
soldiers
handed
over
the
captives
and
the
plunder
to
the
princes
and
the
entire
congregation
15
Then
the
men
who
had
been
designated
by
name
rose
up
and
took
hold
of
the
captives
and
they
provided
clothes
from
the
spoil
for
all
those
among
them
who
were
naked
So
they
clothed
them
and
gave
them
sandals
food
and
drink
and
oil
for
their
skin
Furthermore
they
transported
the
feeble
on
donkeys
and
brought
them
to
their
brothers
in
Jericho
the
city
of
palm
trees
After
that
they
returned
to
Samaria
16
At
that
time
King
Ahaz
asked
the
kings
of
Assyria
for
help
17
And
once
again
the
Edomites
invaded
and
attacked
Judah
and
carried
off
captives
18
The
Philistines
also
made
a
raid
on
the
cities
of
the
Shephelah
and
the
Negeb
of
Judah
and
captured
Beth-shemesh
Aijalon
Gederoth
Soco
and
its
dependent
towns
Timnah
and
its
dependent
towns
and
Gimzo
and
its
dependent
towns
and
they
settled
there
19
Jehovah
humbled
Judah
because
of
King
Ahaz
of
Israel
for
he
had
let
Judah
go
unrestrained
resulting
in
great
unfaithfulness
toward
Jehovah
20
King
Tilgath-pilneser
of
Assyria
eventually
came
against
him
and
caused
him
distress
rather
than
strengthening
him
21
For
Ahaz
had
stripped
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
house
of
the
king
and
the
houses
of
the
princes
and
made
a
gift
to
the
king
of
Assyria
but
it
was
of
no
help
to
him
22
And
during
his
time
of
distress
King
Ahaz
acted
even
more
unfaithfully
toward
Jehovah
23
He
began
to
sacrifice
to
the
gods
of
Damascus
that
had
defeated
him
and
he
went
on
to
say
Because
the
gods
of
the
kings
of
Syria
are
helping
them
I
will
sacrifice
to
them
so
that
they
may
help
me
But
they
caused
him
and
all
Israel
to
stumble
24
Furthermore
Ahaz
collected
the
utensils
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
he
then
cut
to
pieces
the
utensils
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
closed
the
doors
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
made
altars
for
himself
in
every
corner
of
Jerusalem
25
And
in
all
the
cities
of
Judah
he
made
high
places
for
making
sacrificial
smoke
to
other
gods
and
he
offended
Jehovah
the
God
of
his
forefathers
26
As
for
the
rest
of
his
history
all
his
dealings
from
beginning
to
end
there
it
is
written
in
the
Book
of
the
Kings
of
Judah
and
of
Israel
27
Then
Ahaz
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
city
in
Jerusalem
for
they
did
not
bring
him
into
the
burial
places
of
the
kings
of
Israel
And
his
son
Hezekiah
became
king
in
his
place
1
Hezekiah
became
king
at
the
age
of
25
and
he
reigned
for
29
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Abijah
the
daughter
of
Zechariah
2
He
kept
doing
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
just
as
David
his
forefather
had
done
3
In
the
first
year
of
his
reign
in
the
first
month
he
opened
the
doors
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
repaired
them
4
Then
he
brought
the
priests
and
the
Levites
and
assembled
them
in
the
square
to
the
east
5
He
said
to
them
Listen
to
me
you
Levites
Now
sanctify
yourselves
and
sanctify
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
and
remove
what
is
impure
from
the
holy
place
6
For
our
fathers
have
been
unfaithful
and
have
done
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
our
God
They
abandoned
him
and
turned
their
faces
away
from
the
tabernacle
of
Jehovah
and
turned
their
back
on
him
7
They
also
closed
the
doors
of
the
porch
and
extinguished
the
lamps
They
stopped
burning
incense
and
offering
up
burnt
sacrifices
in
the
holy
place
to
the
God
of
Israel
8
Therefore
Jehovahs
indignation
came
against
Judah
and
Jerusalem
so
that
he
made
them
an
object
of
horror
and
astonishment
and
a
cause
for
whistling
as
you
can
see
with
your
own
eyes
9
Here
our
forefathers
fell
by
the
sword
and
our
sons
our
daughters
and
our
wives
went
into
captivity
for
this
10
Now
it
is
my
hearts
desire
to
make
a
covenant
with
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
so
that
his
burning
anger
may
turn
away
from
us
11
My
sons
now
is
not
the
time
to
be
negligent
for
Jehovah
has
chosen
you
to
stand
before
him
to
serve
as
his
ministers
and
to
make
his
sacrifices
smoke
12
At
that
the
Levites
rose
up
Mahath
the
son
of
Amasai
and
Joel
the
son
of
Azariah
of
the
Kohathites
from
the
Merarites
Kish
the
son
of
Abdi
and
Azariah
the
son
of
Jehallelel
from
the
Gershonites
Joah
the
son
of
Zimmah
and
Eden
the
son
of
Joah
13
from
the
sons
of
Elizaphan
Shimri
and
Jeuel
from
the
sons
of
Asaph
Zechariah
and
Mattaniah
14
from
the
sons
of
Heman
Jehiel
and
Shimei
from
the
sons
of
Jeduthun
Shemaiah
and
Uzziel
15
Then
they
gathered
their
brothers
together
and
sanctified
themselves
and
came
as
the
king
had
commanded
by
the
words
of
Jehovah
to
cleanse
the
house
of
Jehovah
16
The
priests
then
went
inside
the
house
of
Jehovah
to
do
the
cleansing
and
brought
out
all
the
uncleanness
that
they
found
in
the
temple
of
Jehovah
and
took
it
to
the
courtyard
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
In
turn
the
Levites
took
it
and
carried
it
outside
to
the
Kidron
Valley
17
Thus
they
began
the
sanctification
on
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
and
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
month
they
reached
the
porch
of
Jehovah
They
sanctified
the
house
of
Jehovah
for
eight
days
and
on
the
16th
day
of
the
first
month
they
finished
18
After
that
they
went
in
to
King
Hezekiah
and
said
We
have
cleansed
the
whole
house
of
Jehovah
the
altar
of
burnt
offering
and
all
its
utensils
and
the
table
of
the
layer
bread
and
all
its
utensils
19
And
all
the
utensils
that
King
Ahaz
cast
aside
during
his
reign
when
he
acted
unfaithfully
we
have
made
ready
and
sanctified
and
they
are
before
the
altar
of
Jehovah
20
And
King
Hezekiah
got
up
early
and
gathered
the
princes
of
the
city
together
and
they
went
up
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
21
They
brought
seven
bulls
seven
rams
seven
male
lambs
and
seven
male
goats
as
a
sin
offering
for
the
kingdom
for
the
sanctuary
and
for
Judah
So
he
told
the
priests
the
descendants
of
Aaron
to
offer
them
up
on
the
altar
of
Jehovah
22
Then
they
slaughtered
the
cattle
and
the
priests
took
the
blood
and
sprinkled
it
on
the
altar
next
they
slaughtered
the
rams
and
sprinkled
the
blood
on
the
altar
and
they
slaughtered
the
male
lambs
and
sprinkled
the
blood
on
the
altar
23
Then
they
brought
the
male
goats
of
the
sin
offering
before
the
king
and
the
congregation
and
laid
their
hands
on
them
24
The
priests
slaughtered
them
and
made
a
sin
offering
with
their
blood
on
the
altar
to
make
atonement
for
all
Israel
because
the
king
said
that
the
burnt
offering
and
the
sin
offering
should
be
for
all
Israel
25
Meanwhile
he
had
the
Levites
stationed
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
with
cymbals
stringed
instruments
and
harps
by
the
commandment
of
David
and
of
Gad
the
kings
visionary
and
of
Nathan
the
prophet
for
the
commandment
was
from
Jehovah
through
his
prophets
26
So
the
Levites
were
standing
with
the
instruments
of
David
and
the
priests
with
the
trumpets
27
Then
Hezekiah
ordered
that
the
burnt
sacrifice
be
offered
on
the
altar
When
the
burnt
offering
started
the
song
of
Jehovah
started
and
also
the
trumpets
following
the
direction
of
the
instruments
of
King
David
of
Israel
28
And
the
whole
congregation
bowed
down
while
the
song
was
sung
and
the
trumpets
were
sounding—all
this
continued
until
the
burnt
offering
was
finished
29
And
as
soon
as
they
finished
making
the
offering
the
king
and
all
those
with
him
bowed
low
and
prostrated
themselves
30
King
Hezekiah
and
the
princes
now
told
the
Levites
to
praise
Jehovah
with
the
words
of
David
and
of
Asaph
the
visionary
So
they
offered
praise
with
great
rejoicing
and
they
bowed
down
and
prostrated
themselves
31
Then
Hezekiah
said
Now
that
you
have
been
set
apart
for
Jehovah
come
and
bring
sacrifices
and
thanksgiving
offerings
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
So
the
congregation
began
to
bring
sacrifices
and
thanksgiving
offerings
and
everyone
with
a
willing
heart
brought
burnt
offerings
32
The
number
of
burnt
offerings
that
the
congregation
brought
was
70
cattle
100
rams
200
male
lambs—all
of
these
as
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah—
33
and
the
holy
offerings
were
600
cattle
and
3000
of
the
flock
34
But
there
were
not
enough
priests
to
skin
all
the
burnt
offerings
so
their
brothers
the
Levites
helped
them
out
until
the
work
was
finished
and
until
the
priests
could
sanctify
themselves
for
the
Levites
were
more
conscientious
about
sanctifying
themselves
than
the
priests
were
35
Also
there
were
many
burnt
offerings
as
well
as
the
fat
pieces
of
the
communion
sacrifices
and
the
drink
offerings
for
the
burnt
offerings
Thus
the
service
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
was
restored
36
So
Hezekiah
and
all
the
people
rejoiced
over
what
the
true
God
had
established
for
the
people
for
this
had
all
happened
so
suddenly
1
Hezekiah
sent
word
to
all
Israel
and
Judah
and
even
wrote
letters
to
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
to
come
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
Jerusalem
to
observe
the
Passover
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
2
However
the
king
his
princes
and
the
whole
congregation
in
Jerusalem
decided
to
observe
the
Passover
in
the
second
month
3
for
they
had
not
been
able
to
observe
it
at
the
regular
time
because
not
enough
priests
had
sanctified
themselves
nor
had
the
people
gathered
in
Jerusalem
4
This
arrangement
seemed
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
and
the
entire
congregation
5
So
they
decided
to
make
an
announcement
throughout
Israel
from
Beer-sheba
to
Dan
that
the
people
should
come
and
observe
the
Passover
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
at
Jerusalem
for
as
a
group
they
had
not
observed
it
according
to
what
is
written
6
Then
the
couriers
went
throughout
all
Israel
and
Judah
with
the
letters
from
the
king
and
his
princes
as
the
king
had
commanded
saying
People
of
Israel
return
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Abraham
Isaac
and
Israel
so
that
he
may
return
to
the
remnant
who
escaped
out
of
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
Assyria
7
Do
not
be
like
your
forefathers
and
your
brothers
who
acted
unfaithfully
toward
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
so
that
he
made
them
an
object
of
horror
just
as
you
are
seeing
8
Now
do
not
be
obstinate
like
your
forefathers
Submit
to
Jehovah
and
come
to
his
sanctuary
that
he
has
sanctified
forever
and
serve
Jehovah
your
God
so
that
his
burning
anger
may
turn
away
from
you
9
For
when
you
return
to
Jehovah
your
brothers
and
your
sons
will
be
shown
mercy
by
their
captors
and
will
be
allowed
to
return
to
this
land
for
Jehovah
your
God
is
compassionate
and
merciful
and
he
will
not
turn
his
face
away
from
you
if
you
return
to
him
10
So
the
couriers
went
from
city
to
city
throughout
the
land
of
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
even
to
Zebulun
but
the
people
were
making
fun
of
them
and
mocking
them
11
However
some
individuals
from
Asher
Manasseh
and
Zebulun
humbled
themselves
and
came
to
Jerusalem
12
The
hand
of
the
true
God
was
also
in
Judah
to
unite
them
to
carry
out
what
the
king
and
the
princes
had
commanded
by
the
word
of
Jehovah
13
A
multitude
of
people
gathered
together
at
Jerusalem
to
observe
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
in
the
second
month
it
was
a
very
large
congregation
14
They
rose
up
and
removed
the
altars
that
were
in
Jerusalem
and
they
removed
all
the
incense
altars
and
threw
them
into
the
Kidron
Valley
15
Then
they
slaughtered
the
Passover
sacrifice
on
the
14th
day
of
the
second
month
The
priests
and
the
Levites
felt
ashamed
so
they
sanctified
themselves
and
brought
burnt
offerings
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
16
They
took
their
customary
places
according
to
the
Law
of
Moses
the
man
of
the
true
God
then
the
priests
sprinkled
the
blood
received
from
the
hand
of
the
Levites
17
There
were
many
in
the
congregation
who
had
not
sanctified
themselves
and
the
Levites
were
in
charge
of
slaughtering
the
Passover
sacrifices
for
all
who
were
not
clean
to
sanctify
them
to
Jehovah
18
For
a
great
number
of
the
people
especially
those
from
Ephraim
Manasseh
Issachar
and
Zebulun
had
not
cleansed
themselves
but
they
still
ate
the
Passover
contrary
to
what
is
written
But
Hezekiah
prayed
for
them
saying
May
Jehovah
who
is
good
make
allowance
for
19
everyone
who
has
prepared
his
heart
to
search
for
the
true
God
Jehovah
the
God
of
his
forefathers
although
he
has
not
been
purified
according
to
the
standard
of
holiness
20
And
Jehovah
listened
to
Hezekiah
and
pardoned
the
people
21
So
the
Israelites
who
were
in
Jerusalem
observed
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
for
seven
days
with
great
rejoicing
and
the
Levites
and
the
priests
were
praising
Jehovah
day
by
day
loudly
playing
their
instruments
to
Jehovah
22
Moreover
Hezekiah
spoke
to
and
encouraged
all
the
Levites
who
served
Jehovah
with
discretion
And
they
ate
throughout
the
festival
for
seven
days
sacrificing
communion
sacrifices
and
giving
thanks
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
23
Then
all
the
congregation
decided
to
observe
it
for
seven
more
days
so
they
observed
it
for
seven
more
days
with
rejoicing
24
And
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
contributed
for
the
congregation
1000
bulls
and
7000
sheep
and
the
princes
contributed
for
the
congregation
1000
bulls
and
10000
sheep
and
priests
were
sanctifying
themselves
in
great
number
25
And
all
the
congregation
of
Judah
the
priests
the
Levites
all
the
congregation
that
came
from
Israel
and
the
foreign
residents
who
came
from
the
land
of
Israel
and
those
living
in
Judah
continued
rejoicing
26
And
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
Jerusalem
for
from
the
days
of
Solomon
the
son
of
David
the
king
of
Israel
nothing
like
this
had
happened
in
Jerusalem
27
Finally
the
Levite
priests
stood
up
and
blessed
the
people
and
God
heard
their
voice
and
their
prayer
reached
his
holy
dwelling
the
heavens
1
As
soon
as
they
had
finished
all
of
this
all
the
Israelites
who
were
present
went
out
to
the
cities
of
Judah
and
they
smashed
the
sacred
pillars
cut
down
the
sacred
poles
and
tore
down
the
high
places
and
the
altars
throughout
Judah
and
Benjamin
as
well
as
in
Ephraim
and
Manasseh
until
they
had
destroyed
them
completely
after
which
all
the
Israelites
returned
to
their
cities
each
one
to
his
own
possession
2
Then
Hezekiah
appointed
the
priests
in
their
divisions
and
the
Levites
in
their
divisions
each
of
the
priests
and
Levites
for
their
service
for
the
burnt
offerings
and
the
communion
sacrifices
to
minister
and
to
give
thanks
and
praise
in
the
gates
of
the
courtyards
of
Jehovah
3
A
portion
of
the
kings
own
goods
was
given
for
the
burnt
offerings
including
the
morning
and
evening
offerings
as
well
as
the
burnt
offerings
for
the
Sabbaths
the
new
moons
and
the
festivals
according
to
what
is
written
in
the
Law
of
Jehovah
4
Furthermore
he
commanded
the
people
living
in
Jerusalem
to
give
the
portion
due
the
priests
and
the
Levites
so
that
they
might
adhere
strictly
to
the
law
of
Jehovah
5
As
soon
as
the
order
was
issued
the
Israelites
gave
in
great
quantities
the
firstfruits
of
the
grain
new
wine
oil
and
honey
and
of
all
the
produce
of
the
field
they
brought
in
abundantly
the
tenth
of
everything
6
And
the
people
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
living
in
the
cities
of
Judah
also
brought
in
the
tenth
of
cattle
and
sheep
and
the
tenth
of
the
holy
things
that
were
sanctified
to
Jehovah
their
God
They
brought
it
in
and
put
it
in
many
heaps
7
In
the
third
month
they
began
laying
their
contributions
in
heaps
and
in
the
seventh
month
they
finished
8
When
Hezekiah
and
the
princes
came
and
saw
the
heaps
they
praised
Jehovah
and
blessed
his
people
Israel
9
Hezekiah
asked
the
priests
and
the
Levites
about
the
heaps
10
and
Azariah
the
chief
priest
of
the
house
of
Zadok
said
to
him
From
the
time
they
started
bringing
the
contributions
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
people
have
been
eating
to
satisfaction
and
there
is
still
an
abundant
surplus
for
Jehovah
has
blessed
his
people
and
this
great
plenty
is
left
over
11
At
this
Hezekiah
told
them
to
prepare
storerooms
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
so
they
prepared
them
12
They
kept
faithfully
bringing
in
the
contributions
the
tenth
parts
and
the
holy
things
Conaniah
the
Levite
was
put
in
charge
of
all
of
this
as
supervisor
and
his
brother
Shimei
was
second
13
Jehiel
Azaziah
Nahath
Asahel
Jerimoth
Jozabad
Eliel
Ismachiah
Mahath
and
Benaiah
were
commissioners
assisting
Conaniah
and
his
brother
Shimei
by
the
order
of
King
Hezekiah
and
Azariah
was
supervisor
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
14
And
Kore
the
son
of
Imnah
the
Levite
gatekeeper
on
the
east
side
was
in
charge
of
the
voluntary
offerings
of
the
true
God
and
he
distributed
the
contribution
made
to
Jehovah
and
the
most
holy
things
15
And
under
his
direction
were
Eden
Miniamin
Jeshua
Shemaiah
Amariah
and
Shecaniah
in
the
cities
of
the
priests
in
their
office
of
trust
to
distribute
equally
to
their
brothers
in
the
divisions
to
great
and
small
alike
16
This
was
in
addition
to
the
distribution
made
to
the
males
from
three
years
old
and
up
who
were
listed
in
the
genealogical
enrollment
who
came
daily
to
serve
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
to
carry
out
the
duties
of
their
divisions
17
The
genealogical
enrollment
of
the
priests
was
by
their
paternal
house
as
was
that
of
the
Levites
who
were
20
years
old
and
up
by
the
duties
of
their
divisions
18
The
genealogical
enrollment
included
all
their
children
their
wives
their
sons
and
their
daughters
their
entire
congregation—for
they
kept
themselves
sanctified
for
what
was
holy
because
of
their
office
of
trust—
19
as
well
as
the
descendants
of
Aaron
the
priests
who
were
living
in
the
fields
of
the
pastures
surrounding
their
cities
In
all
the
cities
men
had
been
designated
by
name
to
give
portions
to
every
male
among
the
priests
and
to
everyone
included
in
the
genealogical
enrollment
of
the
Levites
20
Hezekiah
did
this
throughout
Judah
and
he
continued
to
do
what
was
good
and
right
and
faithful
before
Jehovah
his
God
21
And
every
work
that
he
undertook
to
search
for
his
God
whether
in
connection
with
the
service
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
or
in
the
Law
and
the
commandment
he
did
wholeheartedly
and
he
was
successful
1
After
these
things
and
these
acts
of
faithfulness
King
Sennacherib
of
Assyria
came
and
invaded
Judah
He
besieged
the
fortified
cities
intent
on
breaking
through
and
capturing
them
2
When
Hezekiah
saw
that
Sennacherib
had
come
and
intended
to
wage
war
against
Jerusalem
3
he
decided
after
consulting
with
his
princes
and
his
warriors
to
stop
up
the
waters
of
the
springs
outside
the
city
and
they
gave
him
their
support
4
Many
people
were
gathered
together
and
they
stopped
up
all
the
springs
and
the
stream
that
flowed
through
the
land
saying
Why
should
the
kings
of
Assyria
come
and
find
plenty
of
water
5
Furthermore
with
determination
he
rebuilt
the
entire
broken-down
wall
and
raised
towers
on
it
and
outside
he
made
another
wall
He
also
repaired
the
Mound
of
the
City
of
David
and
he
made
a
large
number
of
weapons
and
shields
6
He
then
appointed
military
chiefs
over
the
people
and
assembled
them
at
the
public
square
of
the
city
gate
and
encouraged
them
saying
7
Be
courageous
and
strong
Do
not
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
because
of
the
king
of
Assyria
and
all
the
multitude
with
him
for
there
are
more
with
us
than
there
are
with
him
8
With
him
is
an
arm
of
flesh
but
with
us
is
Jehovah
our
God
to
help
us
and
to
fight
our
battles
And
the
people
were
strengthened
by
the
words
of
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
9
After
this
while
King
Sennacherib
of
Assyria
was
at
Lachish
with
all
his
imperial
might
he
sent
his
servants
to
Jerusalem
to
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
and
to
all
the
Judeans
in
Jerusalem
saying
10
This
is
what
King
Sennacherib
of
Assyria
says
In
what
are
you
trusting
that
you
remain
in
Jerusalem
while
it
is
besieged
11
Is
not
Hezekiah
misleading
you
and
handing
you
over
to
die
by
famine
and
thirst
saying
Jehovah
our
God
will
rescue
us
from
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria
12
Is
this
not
the
same
Hezekiah
who
removed
your
Gods
high
places
and
His
altars
and
then
said
to
Judah
and
Jerusalem
You
should
bow
down
before
one
altar
and
on
it
you
should
make
your
sacrifices
smoke
13
Do
you
not
know
what
I
and
my
forefathers
did
to
all
the
peoples
of
the
lands
Were
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
the
lands
able
to
rescue
their
land
from
my
hand
14
Who
among
all
the
gods
of
these
nations
that
my
forefathers
devoted
to
destruction
was
able
to
rescue
his
people
from
my
hand
so
that
your
God
should
be
able
to
rescue
you
from
my
hand
15
Now
do
not
let
Hezekiah
deceive
you
or
mislead
you
like
this
Do
not
put
faith
in
him
for
no
god
of
any
nation
or
kingdom
was
able
to
rescue
his
people
from
my
hand
and
from
the
hand
of
my
forefathers
How
much
less
then
will
your
own
God
rescue
you
from
my
hand
16
His
servants
said
even
more
against
Jehovah
the
true
God
and
against
Hezekiah
his
servant
17
He
also
wrote
letters
to
insult
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
and
to
speak
against
him
saying
Like
the
gods
of
the
nations
of
the
lands
who
could
not
rescue
their
people
from
my
hand
so
the
God
of
Hezekiah
will
not
rescue
his
people
from
my
hand
18
They
kept
calling
loudly
in
the
language
of
the
Jews
to
the
people
of
Jerusalem
who
were
on
the
wall
to
make
them
afraid
and
to
terrify
them
in
order
to
capture
the
city
19
They
spoke
against
the
God
of
Jerusalem
the
same
way
as
against
the
gods
of
the
peoples
of
the
earth
which
are
the
work
of
mans
hands
20
But
King
Hezekiah
and
the
prophet
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
kept
praying
about
this
and
crying
out
to
the
heavens
for
help
21
Then
Jehovah
sent
an
angel
and
wiped
out
every
mighty
warrior
leader
and
chief
in
the
camp
of
the
king
of
Assyria
so
that
he
went
back
to
his
own
land
in
disgrace
He
later
entered
the
house
of
his
god
and
there
some
of
his
own
sons
struck
him
down
with
the
sword
22
So
Jehovah
saved
Hezekiah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
from
the
hand
of
King
Sennacherib
of
Assyria
and
from
the
hand
of
all
others
and
gave
them
rest
on
every
side
23
And
many
brought
gifts
to
Jehovah
at
Jerusalem
and
choice
things
to
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
and
he
was
greatly
respected
by
all
the
nations
after
that
24
In
those
days
Hezekiah
became
sick
and
was
at
the
point
of
death
and
he
prayed
to
Jehovah
who
answered
him
and
gave
him
a
sign
25
But
Hezekiah
did
not
respond
appreciatively
to
the
good
done
to
him
for
his
heart
became
haughty
bringing
indignation
against
him
and
against
Judah
and
Jerusalem
26
However
Hezekiah
humbled
himself
for
the
haughtiness
of
his
heart
he
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
and
Jehovahs
indignation
did
not
come
upon
them
in
the
days
of
Hezekiah
27
And
Hezekiah
came
to
have
vast
riches
and
glory
and
he
made
storehouses
for
himself
for
silver
gold
precious
stones
balsam
oil
shields
and
for
all
the
desirable
articles
28
He
also
made
storage
places
for
the
produce
of
grain
and
new
wine
and
oil
as
well
as
stalls
for
all
the
different
kinds
of
livestock
and
stalls
for
the
flocks
29
He
also
acquired
cities
for
himself
and
an
abundance
of
livestock
flocks
and
herds
for
God
gave
him
very
many
possessions
30
It
was
Hezekiah
who
stopped
up
the
upper
source
of
the
waters
of
Gihon
and
directed
them
straight
down
to
the
west
to
the
City
of
David
and
Hezekiah
was
successful
in
every
work
of
his
31
However
when
the
spokesmen
of
the
princes
of
Babylon
were
sent
to
ask
him
about
the
sign
that
had
occurred
in
the
land
the
true
God
left
him
alone
to
put
him
to
the
test
to
get
to
know
all
that
was
in
his
heart
32
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Hezekiah
and
his
acts
of
loyal
love
they
are
written
in
the
vision
of
Isaiah
the
prophet
the
son
of
Amoz
in
the
Book
of
the
Kings
of
Judah
and
of
Israel
33
Then
Hezekiah
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
in
the
ascent
to
the
burial
places
of
the
sons
of
David
and
all
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
honored
him
at
his
death
And
his
son
Manasseh
became
king
in
his
place
1
Manasseh
was
12
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
55
years
in
Jerusalem
2
He
did
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
following
the
detestable
practices
of
the
nations
that
Jehovah
had
driven
out
from
before
the
people
of
Israel
3
He
rebuilt
the
high
places
that
his
father
Hezekiah
had
torn
down
he
set
up
altars
to
the
Baals
and
made
sacred
poles
and
he
bowed
down
to
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
and
served
them
4
He
also
built
altars
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
about
which
Jehovah
had
said
In
Jerusalem
my
name
will
be
forever
5
And
he
built
altars
to
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
in
two
courtyards
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
6
And
he
made
his
own
sons
pass
through
the
fire
in
the
Valley
of
the
Son
of
Hinnom
he
practiced
magic
used
divination
practiced
sorcery
and
appointed
spirit
mediums
and
fortune-tellers
He
did
on
a
grand
scale
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
to
offend
him
7
He
put
the
carved
image
that
he
made
into
the
house
of
the
true
God
about
which
God
had
said
to
David
and
to
his
son
Solomon
In
this
house
and
in
Jerusalem
which
I
have
chosen
out
of
all
the
tribes
of
Israel
I
will
permanently
put
my
name
8
And
I
will
never
again
remove
the
feet
of
Israel
from
the
land
that
I
assigned
to
their
forefathers
provided
they
carefully
observe
all
that
I
have
commanded
them
the
entire
Law
the
regulations
and
the
judicial
decisions
given
through
Moses
9
Manasseh
kept
leading
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
astray
causing
them
to
do
worse
than
the
nations
that
Jehovah
had
annihilated
from
before
the
Israelites
10
Jehovah
kept
speaking
to
Manasseh
and
his
people
but
they
paid
no
attention
11
So
Jehovah
brought
against
them
the
army
chiefs
of
the
king
of
Assyria
and
they
captured
Manasseh
with
hooks
and
bound
him
with
two
copper
fetters
and
took
him
to
Babylon
12
In
his
distress
he
begged
Jehovah
his
God
for
favor
and
kept
humbling
himself
greatly
before
the
God
of
his
forefathers
13
He
kept
praying
to
Him
and
He
was
moved
by
his
entreaty
and
heard
his
request
for
favor
and
He
restored
him
to
Jerusalem
to
his
kingship
Then
Manasseh
came
to
know
that
Jehovah
is
the
true
God
14
After
this
he
built
an
outer
wall
for
the
City
of
David
west
of
Gihon
in
the
valley
and
as
far
as
the
Fish
Gate
and
he
continued
it
around
to
Ophel
and
he
made
it
very
high
Further
he
appointed
army
chiefs
in
all
the
fortified
cities
in
Judah
15
He
then
removed
the
foreign
gods
and
the
idol
image
from
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
all
the
altars
that
he
had
built
in
the
mountain
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
in
Jerusalem
and
he
had
them
thrown
outside
the
city
16
He
also
prepared
the
altar
of
Jehovah
and
began
to
offer
up
communion
sacrifices
and
thanksgiving
sacrifices
on
it
and
he
told
Judah
to
serve
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
17
Nevertheless
the
people
were
still
sacrificing
on
the
high
places
although
only
to
Jehovah
their
God
18
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Manasseh
his
prayer
to
his
God
and
the
words
of
the
visionaries
who
spoke
to
him
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
they
are
recorded
in
the
history
of
the
kings
of
Israel
19
Also
his
prayer
and
how
his
entreaty
was
granted
him
all
his
sins
and
his
unfaithfulness
the
locations
where
he
built
high
places
and
set
up
the
sacred
poles
and
the
graven
images
before
he
humbled
himself
they
are
written
among
the
words
of
his
visionaries
20
Then
Manasseh
was
laid
to
rest
with
his
forefathers
and
they
buried
him
at
his
house
and
his
son
Amon
became
king
in
his
place
21
Amon
was
22
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
two
years
in
Jerusalem
22
And
he
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
just
as
his
father
Manasseh
had
done
and
Amon
sacrificed
to
all
the
graven
images
that
his
father
Manasseh
had
made
and
he
kept
serving
them
23
But
he
did
not
humble
himself
before
Jehovah
as
Manasseh
his
father
had
humbled
himself
instead
Amon
greatly
increased
his
guilt
24
Eventually
his
servants
conspired
against
him
and
put
him
to
death
in
his
own
house
25
But
the
people
of
the
land
struck
down
all
those
who
conspired
against
King
Amon
and
they
made
his
son
Josiah
king
in
his
place
1
Josiah
was
eight
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
31
years
in
Jerusalem
2
He
did
what
was
right
in
Jehovahs
eyes
and
walked
in
the
ways
of
David
his
forefather
and
he
did
not
deviate
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
3
In
the
8th
year
of
his
reign
while
he
was
still
a
boy
he
started
to
search
for
the
God
of
David
his
forefather
and
in
the
12th
year
he
started
to
cleanse
Judah
and
Jerusalem
of
the
high
places
and
the
sacred
poles
the
graven
images
and
the
metal
statues
4
Further
they
tore
down
the
altars
of
the
Baals
in
his
presence
and
he
cut
down
the
incense
stands
that
were
up
above
them
He
also
broke
into
pieces
the
sacred
poles
the
graven
images
and
the
metal
statues
and
reduced
them
to
powder
and
sprinkled
it
over
the
graves
of
those
who
used
to
sacrifice
to
them
5
And
he
burned
the
bones
of
priests
on
their
altars
Thus
he
cleansed
Judah
and
Jerusalem
6
And
in
the
cities
of
Manasseh
Ephraim
Simeon
and
clear
to
Naphtali
in
their
surrounding
ruins
7
he
tore
down
the
altars
and
he
crushed
the
sacred
poles
and
the
graven
images
reducing
them
to
powder
and
he
cut
down
all
the
incense
stands
in
all
the
land
of
Israel
after
which
he
returned
to
Jerusalem
8
In
the
18th
year
of
his
reign
when
he
had
cleansed
the
land
and
the
temple
he
sent
Shaphan
the
son
of
Azaliah
Maaseiah
the
chief
of
the
city
and
Joah
the
son
of
Joahaz
the
recorder
to
repair
the
house
of
Jehovah
his
God
9
They
came
to
Hilkiah
the
high
priest
and
gave
him
the
money
that
had
been
brought
to
the
house
of
God
which
the
Levites
serving
as
doorkeepers
had
collected
from
Manasseh
Ephraim
and
all
the
rest
of
Israel
as
well
as
from
Judah
Benjamin
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
10
Then
they
gave
it
to
those
who
were
appointed
over
the
work
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
In
turn
the
workers
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
used
it
to
mend
and
repair
the
house
11
They
gave
it
to
the
craftsmen
and
the
builders
to
buy
hewn
stones
and
timbers
for
braces
and
to
build
with
beams
the
houses
that
the
kings
of
Judah
had
allowed
to
fall
into
ruin
12
And
the
men
did
the
work
faithfully
Over
them
were
appointed
the
Levites
Jahath
and
Obadiah
of
the
Merarites
and
Zechariah
and
Meshullam
of
the
Kohathites
to
serve
as
overseers
And
the
Levites
all
of
whom
were
skilled
musicians
13
were
in
charge
of
the
common
laborers
and
were
overseers
of
all
those
who
were
doing
the
work
in
every
kind
of
service
and
some
of
the
Levites
were
secretaries
officers
and
gatekeepers
14
While
they
were
taking
out
the
money
that
had
been
brought
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
Hilkiah
the
priest
found
the
book
of
Jehovahs
Law
given
through
Moses
15
So
Hilkiah
said
to
Shaphan
the
secretary
I
have
found
the
book
of
the
Law
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
With
that
Hilkiah
gave
the
book
to
Shaphan
16
Then
Shaphan
brought
the
book
to
the
king
and
told
him
Your
servants
are
doing
everything
that
was
assigned
to
them
17
They
have
poured
out
the
money
that
was
found
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
they
have
handed
it
over
to
the
appointed
men
and
to
those
doing
the
work
18
Shaphan
the
secretary
also
told
the
king
There
is
a
book
that
Hilkiah
the
priest
has
given
me
Then
Shaphan
began
to
read
from
it
before
the
king
19
As
soon
as
the
king
heard
the
words
of
the
Law
he
ripped
his
garments
apart
20
Then
the
king
gave
this
order
to
Hilkiah
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
Abdon
the
son
of
Micah
Shaphan
the
secretary
and
Asaiah
the
kings
servant
21
Go
inquire
of
Jehovah
in
my
behalf
and
in
behalf
of
those
who
remain
in
Israel
and
in
Judah
concerning
the
words
of
the
book
that
has
been
found
for
Jehovahs
rage
that
will
be
poured
out
against
us
is
great
because
our
forefathers
did
not
carry
out
the
word
of
Jehovah
by
observing
all
that
is
written
in
this
book
22
So
Hilkiah
along
with
those
sent
by
the
king
went
to
Huldah
the
prophetess
She
was
the
wife
of
Shallum
son
of
Tikvah
son
of
Harhas
the
caretaker
of
the
wardrobe
and
she
was
dwelling
in
the
Second
Quarter
of
Jerusalem
and
they
spoke
to
her
there
23
She
said
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Tell
the
man
who
sent
you
to
me
24
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
will
bring
calamity
on
this
place
and
its
inhabitants
all
the
curses
that
are
written
in
the
book
that
they
read
before
the
king
of
Judah
25
Because
they
have
abandoned
me
and
are
making
sacrifices
smoke
to
other
gods
in
order
to
offend
me
with
all
the
works
of
their
hands
my
rage
will
pour
out
on
this
place
and
it
will
not
be
extinguished
26
But
to
the
king
of
Judah
who
sent
you
to
inquire
of
Jehovah
this
is
what
you
should
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Regarding
the
words
that
you
have
heard
27
because
your
heart
was
responsive
and
you
humbled
yourself
before
God
on
hearing
his
words
concerning
this
place
and
its
inhabitants
and
you
humbled
yourself
before
me
and
ripped
your
garments
apart
and
wept
before
me
I
also
have
heard
you
declares
Jehovah
28
That
is
why
I
will
gather
you
to
your
ancestors
and
you
will
be
laid
in
your
grave
in
peace
and
your
eyes
will
not
see
all
the
calamity
that
I
will
bring
on
this
place
and
its
inhabitants
Then
they
brought
the
reply
to
the
king
29
So
the
king
sent
word
and
summoned
all
the
elders
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
30
After
that
the
king
went
up
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
with
all
the
men
of
Judah
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
the
priests
the
Levites—all
the
people
the
great
as
well
as
the
small
He
read
in
their
hearing
all
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
covenant
that
had
been
found
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
31
The
king
stood
in
his
place
and
made
a
covenant
before
Jehovah
that
he
would
follow
Jehovah
and
keep
his
commandments
his
reminders
and
his
regulations
with
all
his
heart
and
with
all
his
soul
by
carrying
out
the
words
of
the
covenant
that
were
written
in
this
book
32
Furthermore
he
had
all
those
who
were
in
Jerusalem
and
Benjamin
to
agree
to
it
And
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
acted
according
to
the
covenant
of
God
the
God
of
their
forefathers
33
Josiah
then
removed
all
the
detestable
things
out
of
all
the
lands
that
belonged
to
the
Israelites
and
he
made
everyone
in
Israel
serve
Jehovah
their
God
Throughout
his
lifetime
they
did
not
deviate
from
following
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
1
Josiah
held
a
Passover
to
Jehovah
in
Jerusalem
and
they
slaughtered
the
Passover
sacrifice
on
the
14th
day
of
the
first
month
2
He
assigned
the
priests
to
their
duties
and
encouraged
them
to
carry
out
their
service
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
3
Then
he
said
to
the
Levites
the
instructors
of
all
Israel
those
who
were
holy
to
Jehovah
Put
the
holy
Ark
in
the
house
that
Solomon
the
son
of
David
the
king
of
Israel
built
you
are
no
longer
to
carry
it
on
your
shoulders
Now
serve
Jehovah
your
God
and
his
people
Israel
4
And
prepare
yourselves
by
your
paternal
houses
according
to
your
divisions
following
what
was
written
by
King
David
of
Israel
and
by
his
son
Solomon
5
Stand
in
the
holy
place
grouped
by
the
paternal
houses
of
your
brothers
the
rest
of
the
people
with
a
corresponding
group
of
the
paternal
house
of
the
Levites
6
Slaughter
the
Passover
sacrifice
and
sanctify
yourselves
and
make
preparation
for
your
brothers
to
carry
out
the
word
of
Jehovah
through
Moses
7
Josiah
contributed
flocks
to
the
people
male
lambs
and
young
male
goats
for
the
Passover
sacrifices
for
all
who
were
present
a
total
of
30000
as
well
as
3000
cattle
These
were
from
the
kings
own
property
8
His
princes
also
made
a
contribution
as
a
voluntary
offering
for
the
people
the
priests
and
the
Levites
Hilkiah
Zechariah
and
Jehiel
the
leaders
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
gave
to
the
priests
2600
Passover
sacrifices
and
300
cattle
9
Conaniah
and
his
brothers
Shemaiah
and
Nethanel
along
with
Hashabiah
Jeiel
and
Jozabad
the
chiefs
of
the
Levites
contributed
to
the
Levites
5000
Passover
sacrifices
and
500
cattle
10
The
service
was
prepared
and
the
priests
stood
at
their
places
and
the
Levites
by
their
divisions
as
the
king
had
commanded
11
They
slaughtered
the
Passover
sacrifices
and
the
priests
sprinkled
the
blood
they
received
from
them
while
the
Levites
were
skinning
the
animals
12
Next
they
prepared
the
burnt
offerings
so
as
to
distribute
them
to
the
rest
of
the
people
who
were
grouped
by
paternal
house
so
that
they
could
be
presented
to
Jehovah
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
Moses
and
they
did
the
same
with
the
cattle
13
They
cooked
the
Passover
offering
over
the
fire
according
to
the
custom
and
they
cooked
the
holy
offerings
in
pots
cauldrons
and
pans
after
which
they
brought
it
quickly
to
all
the
rest
of
the
people
14
Then
they
made
preparations
for
themselves
and
for
the
priests
because
the
priests
the
descendants
of
Aaron
were
offering
up
the
burnt
sacrifices
and
the
fat
pieces
until
nightfall
so
the
Levites
made
preparations
for
themselves
and
for
the
priests
the
descendants
of
Aaron
15
And
the
singers
the
sons
of
Asaph
were
at
their
positions
by
the
commandment
of
David
Asaph
Heman
and
Jeduthun
the
visionary
of
the
king
and
the
gatekeepers
were
at
the
different
gates
There
was
no
need
for
them
to
leave
their
service
because
their
brothers
the
Levites
made
preparations
for
them
16
So
all
the
service
of
Jehovah
was
prepared
on
that
day
to
hold
the
Passover
and
to
offer
up
the
burnt
offerings
on
the
altar
of
Jehovah
according
to
the
order
of
King
Josiah
17
The
Israelites
who
were
present
held
the
Passover
at
that
time
and
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
for
seven
days
18
There
had
never
been
held
a
Passover
like
it
in
Israel
since
the
days
of
Samuel
the
prophet
nor
had
any
of
the
other
kings
of
Israel
held
a
Passover
like
that
held
by
Josiah
the
priests
the
Levites
all
Judah
and
Israel
who
were
present
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
19
This
Passover
was
held
in
the
18th
year
of
Josiahs
reign
20
After
all
of
this
when
Josiah
had
prepared
the
temple
King
Necho
of
Egypt
came
up
to
fight
at
Carchemish
by
the
Euphrates
Then
Josiah
went
out
against
him
21
So
he
sent
messengers
to
him
saying
What
does
this
have
to
do
with
you
O
king
of
Judah
I
am
not
coming
against
you
today
but
my
fight
is
against
another
house
and
God
says
that
I
should
hurry
For
your
own
sake
refrain
from
opposing
God
who
is
with
me
or
he
will
bring
you
to
ruin
22
However
Josiah
would
not
turn
away
from
him
but
he
disguised
himself
to
fight
against
him
and
would
not
listen
to
the
words
of
Necho
which
were
from
the
mouth
of
God
So
he
came
to
fight
in
the
Plain
of
Megiddo
23
And
the
archers
shot
King
Josiah
and
the
king
said
to
his
servants
Get
me
out
of
here
for
I
am
severely
wounded
24
So
his
servants
took
him
out
of
the
chariot
and
had
him
ride
in
his
second
war
chariot
and
brought
him
to
Jerusalem
Thus
he
died
and
was
buried
in
the
tomb
of
his
forefathers
and
all
Judah
and
Jerusalem
mourned
Josiah
25
And
Jeremiah
chanted
over
Josiah
and
all
the
male
and
female
singers
keep
singing
about
Josiah
in
their
dirges
down
to
this
day
and
a
decision
was
made
that
they
should
be
sung
in
Israel
and
they
are
written
among
the
dirges
26
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Josiah
and
his
deeds
of
loyal
love
in
keeping
with
what
is
written
in
the
Law
of
Jehovah
27
and
what
he
did
from
beginning
to
end
they
are
written
in
the
Book
of
the
Kings
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
1
Then
the
people
of
the
land
took
Josiahs
son
Jehoahaz
and
made
him
king
in
Jerusalem
in
place
of
his
father
2
Jehoahaz
was
23
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
three
months
in
Jerusalem
3
However
the
king
of
Egypt
deposed
him
in
Jerusalem
and
fined
the
land
100
silver
talents
and
a
gold
talent
4
Furthermore
the
king
of
Egypt
made
Jehoahaz
brother
Eliakim
king
over
Judah
and
Jerusalem
and
changed
his
name
to
Jehoiakim
but
Necho
took
his
brother
Jehoahaz
and
brought
him
to
Egypt
5
Jehoiakim
was
25
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
11
years
in
Jerusalem
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
his
God
6
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
came
up
against
him
in
order
to
bind
him
with
two
copper
fetters
to
take
him
off
to
Babylon
7
And
Nebuchadnezzar
took
some
of
the
utensils
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
to
Babylon
and
put
them
in
his
palace
in
Babylon
8
As
for
the
rest
of
the
history
of
Jehoiakim
the
detestable
things
that
he
did
and
what
was
found
against
him
it
is
written
in
the
Book
of
the
Kings
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
and
his
son
Jehoiachin
became
king
in
his
place
9
Jehoiachin
was
18
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
three
months
and
ten
days
in
Jerusalem
and
he
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
10
At
the
start
of
the
year
King
Nebuchadnezzar
sent
to
have
him
brought
to
Babylon
along
with
valuable
articles
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
And
he
made
his
fathers
brother
Zedekiah
king
over
Judah
and
Jerusalem
11
Zedekiah
was
21
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
11
years
in
Jerusalem
12
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
his
God
He
did
not
humble
himself
before
the
prophet
Jeremiah
who
spoke
at
the
order
of
Jehovah
13
He
also
rebelled
against
King
Nebuchadnezzar
who
had
made
him
take
an
oath
by
God
and
he
remained
stubborn
and
hardhearted
and
refused
to
turn
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
14
All
the
chiefs
of
the
priests
as
well
as
the
people
were
exceedingly
unfaithful
practicing
all
the
detestable
things
of
the
nations
and
they
defiled
the
house
of
Jehovah
that
he
had
sanctified
in
Jerusalem
15
Jehovah
the
God
of
their
forefathers
kept
warning
them
by
means
of
his
messengers
warning
them
again
and
again
because
he
felt
compassion
for
his
people
and
for
his
dwelling
place
16
But
they
kept
ridiculing
the
messengers
of
the
true
God
and
they
despised
his
words
and
mocked
his
prophets
until
the
rage
of
Jehovah
came
up
against
his
people
until
they
were
beyond
healing
17
So
he
brought
against
them
the
king
of
the
Chaldeans
who
killed
their
young
men
with
the
sword
in
the
house
of
their
sanctuary
he
felt
no
compassion
for
young
man
or
virgin
old
or
infirm
God
gave
everything
into
his
hand
18
All
the
utensils
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
great
and
small
as
well
as
the
treasures
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
treasures
of
the
king
and
his
princes
everything
he
brought
to
Babylon
19
He
burned
down
the
house
of
the
true
God
tore
down
the
wall
of
Jerusalem
burned
all
its
fortified
towers
with
fire
and
destroyed
everything
of
value
20
He
carried
off
captive
to
Babylon
those
who
escaped
the
sword
and
they
became
servants
to
him
and
his
sons
until
the
kingdom
of
Persia
began
to
reign
21
to
fulfill
Jehovahs
word
spoken
by
Jeremiah
until
the
land
had
paid
off
its
sabbaths
All
the
days
it
lay
desolate
it
kept
sabbath
to
fulfill
70
years
22
In
the
first
year
of
King
Cyrus
of
Persia
in
order
that
Jehovahs
word
spoken
by
Jeremiah
would
be
fulfilled
Jehovah
stirred
the
spirit
of
King
Cyrus
of
Persia
to
make
a
proclamation
throughout
his
kingdom
which
he
also
put
in
writing
saying
23
This
is
what
King
Cyrus
of
Persia
says
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
heavens
has
given
me
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
and
he
has
commissioned
me
to
build
him
a
house
in
Jerusalem
which
is
in
Judah
Whoever
there
is
among
you
of
all
his
people
may
Jehovah
his
God
be
with
him
and
let
him
go
up

3
Whoever
there

may
his
God
be
with
him
and
let
him
go
up
to
Jerusalem

is
in
Judah
and
rebuild
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel—he
is
the
true
God—whose
house
was
in
Jerusalem
4
Anyone
who
is
residing
as
a
foreigner
wherever
he
may
be
let
him
be
helped
by
his
neighbors
by
their
giving
him
silver
and
gold
goods
and
livestock
along
with
the
voluntary
offering
for
the
house
of
the
true
God
which
was
in
Jerusalem
5
Then
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
Judah
and
of
Benjamin
and
the
priests
and
the
Levites—everyone
whose
spirit
the
true
God
had
stirred—prepared
to
go
up
and
rebuild
the
house
of
Jehovah
which
was
in
Jerusalem
6
All
those
around
them
supported
them
by
giving
them
utensils
of
silver
and
of
gold
goods
livestock
and
valuable
things
besides
all
the
voluntary
offerings
7
King
Cyrus
also
brought
out
the
utensils
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
that
Nebuchadnezzar
had
taken
from
Jerusalem
and
had
put
in
the
house
of
his
god
8
King
Cyrus
of
Persia
brought
them
out
under
the
supervision
of
Mithredath
the
treasurer
who
made
an
inventory
of
them
for
Sheshbazzar
the
chieftain
of
Judah
9
Now
this
was
the
inventory
30
basket-shaped
vessels
of
gold
1000

of
silver
29
replacement

10
30

were

Sheshbazzar
brought
all
of
these
up
when
the
exiles
were
brought
out
of
Babylon
to
Jerusalem
1
And
these
were
the
people
of
the
province
who
came
up
from
the
captives
of
the
exile
those
whom
King
Nebuchadnezzar

All

were
392
59
And
these
went
up
from
Tel-melah
Tel-harsha
Cherub

and

but
they
were
unable
to
verify
their
paternal
house
and

they
were

And
of

the

the

the

who
took
a

from

the
Gileadite
and
was
called
by
their
name
62
These
looked
for
their
records
to
establish
their
genealogy
but
they
did
not
find
them
so
they
were
disqualified
from
the
priesthood
63
The
governor
told
them
that
they
could
not
eat
from
the
most
holy
things
until
there
was
a
priest
who
could
consult
the
Urim
and
Thummim
64
The
total
number
of
the
entire
congregation
was
42360
65
apart
from
their
male
and
female
slaves
who
were
7337
they
also
had
200
male
and
female
singers
66
Their
horses
were
736
their
mules
245
67
their
camels
435
their
donkeys
6720
68
When
they
arrived
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
Jerusalem
some
of
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
made
voluntary
offerings
for
the
house
of
the
true
God
to
rebuild
it
on
its
own
site
69
According
to
their
means
they
gave
to
the
project
treasury
61000
gold
drachmas
5000
silver
minas
and
100
robes
for
the
priests
70
And
the
priests
the
Levites
some
of
the
people
the
singers
the
gatekeepers
and
the
temple
servants
settled
in
their
cities
and
all
the
rest
of
Israel
settled
in
their
cities
1
When
the
seventh
month
arrived
and
the
Israelites
were
in
their
cities
they
gathered
together
with
one
accord
in
Jerusalem
2
Jeshua
the
son
of
Jehozadak
and
his
fellow
priests
and
Zerubbabel
the
son
of
Shealtiel
and
his
brothers
rose
up
and
built
the
altar
of
the
God
of
Israel
so
that
they
could
offer
up
burnt
sacrifices
on
it
as
it
is
written
in
the
Law
of
Moses
the
man
of
the
true
God
3
So
they
set
the
altar
up
on
its
former
site
despite
their
fear
of
the
peoples
of
the
surrounding
lands
and
they
began
offering
up
burnt
sacrifices
to
Jehovah
on
it
the
morning
and
the
evening
burnt
sacrifices
4
Then
they
held
the
Festival
of
Booths
according
to
what
is
written
and
day
by
day
they
offered
up
the
specified
number
of
burnt
sacrifices
that
were
required
each
day
5
Afterward
they
offered
up
the
regular
burnt
offering
and
the
offerings
for
the
new
moons
and
those
for
all
the
sanctified
festival
seasons
of
Jehovah
as
well
as
those
from
everyone
who
willingly
offered
a
voluntary
offering
to
Jehovah
6
From
the
first
day
of
the
seventh
month
they
started
to
offer
up
burnt
sacrifices
to
Jehovah
though
the
foundation
of
Jehovahs
temple
had
not
yet
been
laid
7
They
gave
money
to
the
stonecutters
and
the
craftsmen
and
food
and
drink
and
oil
to
the
Sidonians
and
the
Tyrians
for
bringing
cedar
timbers
by
sea
from
Lebanon
to
Joppa
according
to
the
authorization
granted
them
by
King
Cyrus
of
Persia
8
In
the
second
year
after
they
came
to
the
house
of
the
true
God
at
Jerusalem
in
the
second
month
Zerubbabel
the
son
of
Shealtiel
Jeshua
the
son
of
Jehozadak
and
the
rest
of
their
brothers
the
priests
and
the
Levites
and
all
those
who
had
come
to
Jerusalem
out
of
the
captivity
started
the
work
they
appointed
the
Levites
from
20
years
old
and
up
to
serve
as
supervisors
over
the
work
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
9
So
Jeshua
his
sons
and
his
brothers
and
Kadmiel
and
his
sons
the
sons
of
Judah
joined
together
to
supervise
those
doing
the
work
in
the
house
of
the
true
God
along
with
the
sons
of
Henadad
their
sons
and
their
brothers
the
Levites
10
When
the
builders
laid
the
foundation
of
the
temple
of
Jehovah
then
the
priests
in
official
clothing
with
the
trumpets
and
the
Levites
the
sons
of
Asaph
with
the
cymbals
stood
up
to
praise
Jehovah
according
to
the
direction
of
King
David
of
Israel
11
And
they
began
to
sing
in
response
by
praising
and
giving
thanks
to
Jehovah
for
he
is
good
his
loyal
love
toward
Israel
endures
forever
Then
all
the
people
shouted
with
a
loud
shout
of
praise
to
Jehovah
because
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
had
been
laid
12
Many
of
the
priests
the
Levites
and
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses—the
old
men
who
had
seen
the
former
house—wept
with
a
loud
voice
when
they
saw
the
foundation
of
this
house
being
laid
while
many
others
shouted
joyfully
at
the
top
of
their
voice
13
So
the
people
could
not
distinguish
the
sound
of
the
joyful
shouts
from
the
sound
of
the
weeping
for
the
people
were
shouting
so
loudly
that
the
sound
was
heard
from
a
great
distance
1
When
the
enemies
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
heard
that
the
returned
exiles
were
building
a
temple
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
2
they
immediately
approached
Zerubbabel
and
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
and
said
to
them
Let
us
build
along
with
you
for
like
you
we
worship
your
God
and
we
have
been
sacrificing
to
him
since
the
days
of
King
Esar-haddon
of
Assyria
who
brought
us
here
3
However
Zerubbabel
and
Jeshua
and
the
rest
of
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
Israel
said
to
them
You
have
no
share
with
us
in
building
a
house
to
our
God
for
we
alone
will
build
it
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
just
as
King
Cyrus
the
king
of
Persia
has
commanded
us
4
Then
the
people
of
the
land
were
continually
discouraging
the
people
of
Judah
and
disheartening
them
from
building
5
They
hired
advisers
against
them
to
frustrate
their
plans
all
the
days
of
King
Cyrus
of
Persia
until
the
reign
of
King
Darius
of
Persia
6
At
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
Ahasuerus
they
wrote
an
accusation
against
the
inhabitants
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
7
And
in
the
days
of
King
Artaxerxes
of
Persia
Bishlam
Mithredath
Tabeel
and
the
rest
of
his
colleagues
wrote
to
Artaxerxes
the
king
they
translated
the
letter
into
Aramaic
writing
it
with
Aramaic
characters
8
Rehum
the
chief
government
official
and
Shimshai
the
scribe
wrote
a
letter
against
Jerusalem
to
King
Artaxerxes
as
follows
9
It
was
from
Rehum
the
chief
government
official
and
Shimshai
the
scribe
and
the
rest
of
their
colleagues
the
judges
and
the
lesser
governors
the
secretaries
the
people
of
Erech
the
Babylonians
the
inhabitants
of
Susa
that
is
the
Elamites
10
and
the
rest
of
the
nations
that
the
great
and
honorable
Asenappar
took
into
exile
and
settled
in
the
cities
of
Samaria
and
the
rest
in
the
region
Beyond
the
River
and
now
11
this
is
a
copy
of
the
letter
that
they
sent
him
To
King
Artaxerxes
from
your
servants
the
men
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
And
now
12
let
it
be
known
to
the
king
that
the
Jews
who
came
up
here
from
you
to
us
have
arrived
at
Jerusalem
They
are
rebuilding
the
rebellious
and
wicked
city
and
they
are
finishing
the
walls
and
repairing
the
foundations
13
Now
let
it
be
known
to
the
king
that
if
this
city
should
be
rebuilt
and
its
walls
finished
they
will
not
give
tax
tribute
or
toll
and
it
will
result
in
a
loss
to
the
treasuries
of
the
kings
14
Since
we
eat
the
salt
of
the
palace
and
it
is
not
proper
for
us
to
see
the
kings
interests
harmed
we
have
therefore
sent
to
make
this
known
to
the
king
15
so
that
there
may
be
an
investigation
of
the
book
of
records
of
your
ancestors
You
will
find
in
the
book
of
records
and
learn
that
this
city
is
a
rebellious
city
injurious
to
kings
and
provinces
and
within
it
have
been
those
stirring
up
sedition
from
ancient
times
That
is
why
this
city
was
destroyed
16
We
are
making
known
to
the
king
that
if
this
city
is
rebuilt
and
its
walls
are
finished
you
will
have
no
control
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
17
The
king
sent
word
to
Rehum
the
chief
government
official
and
Shimshai
the
scribe
and
the
rest
of
their
colleagues
who
were
dwelling
in
Samaria
and
the
rest
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
Greetings
And
now
18
the
official
document
that
you
sent
us
has
been
clearly
read
before
me
19
By
my
order
an
investigation
was
made
and
it
was
found
that
from
long
ago
the
city
has
had
uprisings
against
kings
and
rebellions
and
revolts
have
taken
place
there
20
There
were
powerful
kings
over
Jerusalem
who
ruled
the
whole
region
Beyond
the
River
and
tax
tribute
and
toll
were
paid
to
them
21
Now
issue
an
order
for
these
men
to
stop
work
so
that
the
city
may
not
be
rebuilt
until
I
issue
an
order
22
Be
careful
not
to
neglect
acting
in
this
regard
so
that
the
kings
interests
are
not
harmed
any
further
23
Now
after
the
copy
of
the
official
document
of
King
Artaxerxes
had
been
read
before
Rehum
and
Shimshai
the
scribe
and
their
colleagues
they
quickly
went
to
Jerusalem
to
the
Jews
and
used
force
to
stop
them
24
It
was
then
that
the
work
on
the
house
of
God
which
was
in
Jerusalem
came
to
a
halt
and
it
remained
at
a
standstill
until
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
King
Darius
of
Persia
1
Then
the
prophets
Haggai
and
Zechariah
the
grandson
of
Iddo
prophesied
to
the
Jews
who
were
in
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem
in
the
name
of
the
God
of
Israel
who
was
over
them
2
It
was
then
that
Zerubbabel
the
son
of
Shealtiel
and
Jeshua
the
son
of
Jehozadak
started
to
rebuild
the
house
of
God
which
was
in
Jerusalem
and
the
prophets
of
God
were
with
them
and
supported
them
3
At
that
time
Tattenai
the
governor
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
and
Shethar-bozenai
and
their
colleagues
came
to
them
and
asked
them
Who
issued
an
order
to
you
to
build
this
house
and
to
finish
this
structure
4
Then
they
asked
them
What
are
the
names
of
the
men
who
are
working
on
this
building
5
But
God
was
watching
over
the
elders
of
the
Jews
and
they
did
not
stop
them
until
the
report
could
be
sent
to
Darius
and
an
official
document
could
be
sent
back
concerning
this
6
Here
is
a
copy
of
the
letter
that
Tattenai
the
governor
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
and
Shethar-bozenai
and
his
colleagues
the
lesser
governors
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
sent
to
King
Darius
7
they
sent
the
report
to
him
and
this
is
what
they
wrote
To
King
Darius
All
peace
8
Let
it
be
known
to
the
king
that
we
went
to
the
province
of
Judah
to
the
house
of
the
great
God
and
it
is
being
built
with
large
stones
rolled
into
place
and
timbers
are
being
laid
in
the
walls
The
work
is
being
eagerly
done
by
the
people
and
is
making
progress
through
their
efforts
9
Then
we
questioned
their
elders
asking
them
Who
issued
an
order
to
you
to
build
this
house
and
to
finish
this
structure
10
We
also
asked
them
their
names
to
inform
you
so
that
we
could
write
the
names
of
the
men
who
are
taking
the
lead
11
This
is
the
response
they
gave
us
We
are
the
servants
of
the
God
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
we
are
rebuilding
the
house
that
was
built
many
years
ago
which
a
great
king
of
Israel
built
and
finished
12
However
because
our
fathers
angered
the
God
of
the
heavens
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
the
Chaldean
who
demolished
this
house
and
took
the
people
into
exile
to
Babylon
13
Nevertheless
in
the
first
year
of
King
Cyrus
of
Babylon
King
Cyrus
issued
an
order
to
rebuild
this
house
of
God
14
Moreover
King
Cyrus
took
out
of
the
temple
of
Babylon
the
gold
and
silver
vessels
of
the
house
of
God
that
Nebuchadnezzar
had
taken
from
the
temple
in
Jerusalem
and
had
brought
to
the
temple
of
Babylon
They
were
given
to
a
man
named
Sheshbazzar
whom
Cyrus
made
governor
15
Cyrus
said
to
him
Take
these
vessels
Go
deposit
them
in
the
temple
that
is
in
Jerusalem
and
let
the
house
of
God
be
rebuilt
in
its
former
place
16
Then
this
Sheshbazzar
came
and
he
laid
the
foundations
of
the
house
of
God
which
is
in
Jerusalem
and
it
has
been
under
construction
from
then
until
now
but
it
has
not
been
completed
17
Now
if
it
seems
good
to
the
king
let
an
investigation
be
made
in
the
royal
treasury
there
in
Babylon
to
determine
whether
King
Cyrus
issued
an
order
to
rebuild
that
house
of
God
in
Jerusalem
and
let
the
decision
of
the
king
concerning
this
be
sent
to
us
1
It
was
then
that
King
Darius
issued
an
order
and
they
made
an
investigation
in
the
archives
where
the
treasures
were
deposited
in
Babylon
2
And
a
scroll
was
found
in
the
citadel
at
Ecbatana
in
the
province
of
Media
and
the
following
memorandum
was
written
on
it
3
In
the
first
year
of
King
Cyrus
King
Cyrus
issued
an
order
concerning
the
house
of
God
in
Jerusalem
Let
the
house
be
rebuilt
as
the
place
where
they
are
to
offer
sacrifices
and
its
foundations
are
to
be
set
in
place
its
height
is
to
be
60
cubits
its
width
60
cubits
4
with
three
layers
of
large
stones
rolled
into
place
and
one
layer
of
timbers
and
let
the
expense
be
paid
from
the
kings
house
5
Also
let
the
gold
and
silver
vessels
of
the
house
of
God
that
Nebuchadnezzar
took
out
of
the
temple
that
was
in
Jerusalem
and
brought
to
Babylon
be
returned
so
that
they
may
be
put
in
their
place
in
the
temple
in
Jerusalem
and
be
deposited
in
the
house
of
God
6
So
now
Tattenai
the
governor
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
Shethar-bozenai
and
your
colleagues
the
lesser
governors
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River—stay
away
from
there
7
Do
not
interfere
with
the
work
on
that
house
of
God
The
governor
of
the
Jews
and
the
elders
of
the
Jews
will
rebuild
that
house
of
God
in
its
former
place
8
Furthermore
I
am
issuing
an
order
as
to
what
you
are
to
do
for
these
elders
of
the
Jews
for
rebuilding
that
house
of
God
From
the
royal
treasury
from
the
tax
collected
in
the
region
Beyond
the
River
the
expenses
are
to
be
promptly
given
to
these
men
to
continue
without
interruption
9
And
whatever
is
needed—young
bulls
as
well
as
rams
and
lambs
for
the
burnt
offerings
to
the
God
of
heaven
wheat
salt
wine
and
oil
just
as
the
priests
who
are
in
Jerusalem
say—is
to
be
given
them
continually
day
by
day
without
fail
10
so
that
they
may
continually
present
offerings
that
please
the
God
of
the
heavens
and
pray
for
the
life
of
the
king
and
his
sons
11
I
have
also
issued
an
order
that
if
anyone
violates
this
decree
a
timber
will
be
pulled
out
of
his
house
and
he
will
be
lifted
up
and
fastened
to
it
and
his
house
will
be
turned
into
a
public
latrine
for
this
offense
12
And
may
the
God
who
has
caused
his
name
to
reside
there
overthrow
any
king
and
people
who
lift
a
hand
to
violate
this
order
and
destroy
that
house
of
God
which
is
in
Jerusalem
I
Darius
issue
this
order
Let
it
be
done
promptly
13
Then
Tattenai
the
governor
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
Shethar-bozenai
and
their
colleagues
promptly
carried
out
everything
that
King
Darius
had
ordered
14
And
the
elders
of
the
Jews
continued
building
and
making
progress
urged
on
by
the
prophesying
of
Haggai
the
prophet
and
Zechariah
the
grandson
of
Iddo
they
finished
building
it
by
the
order
of
the
God
of
Israel
and
by
the
order
of
Cyrus
and
Darius
and
King
Artaxerxes
of
Persia
15
They
completed
the
house
by
the
third
day
of
the
month
of
Adar
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
King
Darius
16
Then
the
Israelites
the
priests
the
Levites
and
the
rest
of
the
former
exiles
held
the
inauguration
of
this
house
of
God
with
joy
17
And
they
presented
for
the
inauguration
of
this
house
of
God
100
bulls
200
rams
400
lambs
and
as
a
sin
offering
for
all
Israel
12
male
goats
corresponding
to
the
number
of
the
tribes
of
Israel
18
And
they
appointed
the
priests
in
their
groups
and
the
Levites
in
their
divisions
for
the
service
of
God
in
Jerusalem
according
to
what
is
written
in
the
book
of
Moses
19
And
the
former
exiles
held
the
Passover
on
the
14th
day
of
the
first
month
20
The
priests
and
the
Levites
without
exception
had
cleansed
themselves
so
they
were
all
clean
they
slaughtered
the
Passover
sacrifice
for
all
the
former
exiles
for
their
fellow
priests
and
for
themselves
21
Then
the
Israelites
who
had
returned
from
the
exile
ate
of
it
along
with
everyone
who
had
joined
them
and
had
separated
himself
from
the
uncleanness
of
the
nations
of
the
land
to
worship
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
22
They
also
joyfully
held
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
for
seven
days
for
Jehovah
caused
them
to
rejoice
and
he
had
made
the
heart
of
the
king
of
Assyria
favorable
toward
them
so
that
he
supported
them
in
the
work
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
the
God
of
Israel
1
After
these
things
during
the
reign
of
King
Artaxerxes
of
Persia
Ezra
returned
He
was
the
son
of
Seraiah
son
of
Azariah
son
of
Hilkiah
2
son
of
Shallum
son
of
Zadok
son
of
Ahitub
3
son
of
Amariah
son
of
Azariah
son
of
Meraioth
4
son
of
Zerahiah
son
of
Uzzi
son
of
Bukki
5
son
of
Abishua
son
of
Phinehas
son
of
Eleazar
son
of
Aaron
the
chief
priest
6
This
Ezra
came
up
from
Babylon
He
was
a
copyist
who
was
well-versed
in
the
Law
of
Moses
which
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
had
given
The
king
granted
everything
he
requested
for
the
hand
of
Jehovah
his
God
was
upon
him
7
Some
of
the
Israelites
the
priests
the
Levites
the
singers
the
gatekeepers
and
the
temple
servants
went
up
to
Jerusalem
in
the
seventh
year
of
King
Artaxerxes
8
And
Ezra
came
to
Jerusalem
in
the
fifth
month
in
the
seventh
year
of
the
king
9
On
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
he
began
the
journey
from
Babylon
and
he
arrived
in
Jerusalem
on
the
first
day
of
the
fifth
month
for
the
good
hand
of
his
God
was
upon
him
10
Ezra
had
prepared
his
heart
to
consult
the
Law
of
Jehovah
and
to
practice
it
and
to
teach
its
regulations
and
judgments
in
Israel
11
This
is
a
copy
of
the
letter
that
King
Artaxerxes
gave
to
Ezra
the
priest
and
copyist
an
expert
in
the
study
of
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
and
of
his
regulations
to
Israel
12
Artaxerxes
the
king
of
kings
to
Ezra
the
priest
the
copyist
of
the
Law
of
the
God
of
the
heavens
May
you
have
perfect
peace
And
now
13
I
have
issued
an
order
that
everyone
in
my
realm
of
the
people
of
Israel
and
their
priests
and
Levites
who
is
willing
to
go
with
you
to
Jerusalem
should
go
14
For
you
are
sent
by
the
king
and
his
seven
advisers
to
investigate
whether
the
Law
of
your
God
which
is
with
you
is
being
applied
in
Judah
and
Jerusalem
15
and
to
take
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
the
king
and
his
advisers
have
voluntarily
given
to
the
God
of
Israel
whose
residence
is
in
Jerusalem
16
with
all
the
silver
and
the
gold
that
you
receive
in
all
the
province
of
Babylon
along
with
the
gift
that
the
people
and
the
priests
voluntarily
give
to
the
house
of
their
God
which
is
in
Jerusalem
17
And
you
are
to
buy
promptly
with
this
money
bulls
rams
lambs
along
with
their
grain
offerings
and
their
drink
offerings
and
you
are
to
present
them
on
the
altar
of
the
house
of
your
God
in
Jerusalem
18
And
whatever
seems
good
to
you
and
to
your
brothers
to
do
you
may
do
with
the
rest
of
the
silver
and
the
gold
according
to
the
will
of
your
God
19
And
all
the
vessels
that
are
given
to
you
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
your
God
you
are
to
deliver
before
God
at
Jerusalem
20
And
the
rest
of
the
necessities
of
the
house
of
your
God
that
you
are
required
to
give
you
will
give
out
of
the
royal
treasury
21
I
King
Artaxerxes
have
issued
an
order
to
all
the
treasurers
in
the
region
Beyond
the
River
that
everything
that
Ezra
the
priest
the
copyist
of
the
Law
of
the
God
of
the
heavens
requests
of
you
is
to
be
done
promptly
22
up
to
100
talents
of
silver
100
cor
measures
of
wheat
100
bath
measures
of
wine
100
bath
measures
of
oil
and
salt
without
limit
23
Let
everything
that
is
ordered
by
the
God
of
the
heavens
be
done
with
zeal
for
the
house
of
the
God
of
the
heavens
so
that
there
may
be
no
wrath
against
the
kings
realm
and
his
sons
24
And
you
are
further
advised
that
it
is
not
permitted
to
impose
any
tax
tribute
or
toll
on
any
of
the
priests
and
Levites
musicians
doorkeepers
temple
servants
and
workers
of
this
house
of
God
25
And
you
Ezra
according
to
the
wisdom
that
you
possess
from
your
God
appoint
magistrates
and
judges
to
judge
all
the
people
in
the
region
Beyond
the
River
all
those
who
know
the
laws
of
your
God
and
you
should
instruct
anyone
who
does
not
know
them
26
And
everyone
who
does
not
observe
the
Law
of
your
God
and
the
law
of
the
king
should
have
judgment
executed
on
him
promptly
whether
it
is
death
banishment
a
fine
or
imprisonment
27
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
our
forefathers
be
praised
who
put
it
into
the
heart
of
the
king
to
beautify
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
Jerusalem
28
And
he
has
shown
me
loyal
love
before
the
king
and
his
advisers
and
all
the
mighty
princes
of
the
king
So
I
took
courage
because
the
hand
of
Jehovah
my
God
was
upon
me
and
I
gathered
out
of
Israel
leading
men
to
go
up
with
me
1
Now
these
were
the
heads
of
their
paternal
houses
and
the
genealogical
enrollment
of
those
who
went
up
with
me
out
of
Babylon
during
the
reign
of
King
Artaxerxes
2
of
the
sons
of
Phinehas
Gershom
of
the
sons
of
Ithamar
Daniel
of
the
sons
of
David
Hattush
3
of
the
sons
of
Shecaniah
of
the
sons
of
Parosh
Zechariah
and
with
him
there
was
an
enrollment
of
150
males
4
of
the
sons
of
Pahath-moab
Elieho-enai
the
son
of
Zerahiah
and
with
him
200
males
5
of
the
sons
of
Zattu
Shecaniah
the
son
of
Jahaziel
and
with
him
300
males
6
of
the
sons
of
Adin
Ebed
the
son
of
Jonathan
and
with
him
50
males
7
of
the
sons
of
Elam
Jeshaiah
the
son
of
Athaliah
and
with
him
70
males
8
of
the
sons
of
Shephatiah
Zebadiah
the
son
of
Michael
and
with
him
80
males
9
of
the
sons
of
Joab
Obadiah
the
son
of
Jehiel
and
with
him
218
males
10
of
the
sons
of
Bani
Shelomith
the
son
of
Josiphiah
and
with
him
160
males
11
of
the
sons
of
Bebai
Zechariah
the
son
of
Bebai
and
with
him
28
males
12
of
the
sons
of
Azgad
Johanan
the
son
of
Hakkatan
and
with
him
110
males
13
of
the
sons
of
Adonikam
those
who
were
the
last
and
these
were
their
names
Eliphelet
Jeiel
and
Shemaiah
and
with
them
60
males
14
and
of
the
sons
of
Bigvai
Uthai
and
Zabbud
and
with
them
70
males
15
I
assembled
them
at
the
river
that
comes
to
Ahava
and
we
camped
there
for
three
days
But
when
I
examined
the
people
and
the
priests
I
did
not
find
any
of
the
Levites
there
16
So
I
sent
for
Eliezer
Ariel
Shemaiah
Elnathan
Jarib
Elnathan
Nathan
Zechariah
and
Meshullam
who
were
leading
men
and
for
Joiarib
and
Elnathan
who
were
instructors
17
Then
I
gave
them
a
command
concerning
Iddo
the
leader
in
the
place
called
Casiphia
I
told
them
to
tell
Iddo
and
his
brothers
the
temple
servants
who
were
in
Casiphia
to
bring
to
us
ministers
for
the
house
of
our
God
18
Since
the
good
hand
of
our
God
was
upon
us
they
brought
a
discreet
man
from
the
sons
of
Mahli
the
grandson
of
Levi
the
son
of
Israel
namely
Sherebiah
and
his
sons
and
his
brothers
18
men
19
and
Hashabiah
and
with
him
Jeshaiah
from
the
Merarites
his
brothers
and
their
sons
20
men
20
And
there
were
220
of
the
temple
servants
whom
David
and
the
princes
gave
to
the
service
of
the
Levites
all
of
whom
had
been
designated
by
name
21
Then
I
proclaimed
a
fast
there
at
the
river
Ahava
to
humble
ourselves
before
our
God
to
seek
guidance
from
him
for
our
journey
for
us
and
for
our
children
and
for
all
our
goods
22
I
was
ashamed
to
ask
the
king
for
soldiers
and
horsemen
to
protect
us
against
the
enemies
along
the
way
because
we
had
said
to
the
king
The
good
hand
of
our
God
is
over
all
those
seeking
him
but
his
strength
and
his
anger
are
against
all
those
abandoning
him
23
So
we
fasted
and
made
request
of
our
God
concerning
this
and
he
listened
to
our
entreaty
24
I
now
set
apart
12
of
the
chiefs
of
the
priests
namely
Sherebiah
and
Hashabiah
along
with
ten
of
their
brothers
25
Then
I
weighed
out
to
them
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
utensils
the
contribution
that
the
king
and
his
advisers
and
his
princes
and
all
the
Israelites
who
were
present
there
had
made
to
the
house
of
our
God
26
Thus
I
weighed
out
into
their
hand
650
talents
of
silver
100
silver
utensils
worth
2
talents
100
talents
of
gold
27
20
small
gold
bowls
worth
1000
darics
and
2
utensils
of
fine
copper
gleaming
red
as
desirable
as
gold
28
Then
I
said
to
them
You
are
holy
to
Jehovah
and
the
utensils
are
holy
and
the
silver
and
the
gold
are
a
voluntary
offering
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
29
Guard
them
carefully
until
you
weigh
them
out
before
the
chiefs
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites
and
the
princes
of
the
paternal
houses
of
Israel
in
Jerusalem
in
the
chambers
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
30
And
the
priests
and
the
Levites
took
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
utensils
that
had
been
weighed
out
to
them
in
order
to
bring
them
to
Jerusalem
to
the
house
of
our
God
31
Finally
we
pulled
away
from
the
river
Ahava
on
the
12th
day
of
the
first
month
to
go
to
Jerusalem
and
the
hand
of
our
God
was
over
us
and
he
rescued
us
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
and
from
ambush
along
the
way
32
So
we
came
to
Jerusalem
and
stayed
there
for
three
days
33
And
on
the
fourth
day
we
weighed
out
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
the
utensils
in
the
house
of
our
God
and
handed
them
over
to
Meremoth
son
of
Urijah
the
priest
and
with
him
was
Eleazar
son
of
Phinehas
and
with
them
were
the
Levites
Jozabad
son
of
Jeshua
and
Noadiah
son
of
Binnui
34
Everything
was
numbered
and
weighed
and
all
the
weight
was
recorded
35
Those
coming
out
of
the
captivity
the
former
exiles
presented
burnt
sacrifices
to
the
God
of
Israel
12
bulls
for
all
Israel
96
rams
77
male
lambs
and
12
male
goats
as
a
sin
offering
all
of
this
was
a
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
36
Then
we
gave
the
decrees
of
the
king
to
the
satraps
of
the
king
and
the
governors
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
and
they
supported
the
people
and
the
house
of
the
true
God
1
And
as
soon
as
these
things
had
been
done
the
princes
approached
me
and
said
The
people
of
Israel
and
the
priests
and
the
Levites
have
not
separated
themselves
from
the
peoples
of
the
lands
and
their
detestable
practices
those
of
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Perizzites
the
Jebusites
the
Ammonites
the
Moabites
the
Egyptians
and
the
Amorites
2
They
have
taken
some
of
their
daughters
as
wives
for
themselves
and
for
their
sons
Now
they
the
holy
offspring
have
become
mingled
with
the
peoples
of
the
lands
The
princes
and
the
deputy
rulers
have
been
the
foremost
offenders
in
this
unfaithfulness
3
Now
as
soon
as
I
heard
of
this
I
ripped
apart
my
garment
and
my
sleeveless
coat
and
pulled
out
some
of
the
hair
of
my
head
and
my
beard
and
I
sat
down
in
shock
4
Then
everyone
who
had
reverence
for
the
words
of
the
God
of
Israel
gathered
around
me
because
of
the
unfaithfulness
of
the
exiled
people
while
I
was
sitting
in
shock
until
the
evening
grain
offering
5
And
at
the
time
of
the
evening
grain
offering
I
stood
up
from
my
humiliation
with
my
garment
and
my
sleeveless
coat
torn
apart
and
I
got
down
on
my
knees
and
spread
out
my
hands
to
Jehovah
my
God
6
And
I
said
O
my
God
I
feel
ashamed
and
embarrassed
to
raise
my
face
to
you
O
my
God
for
our
errors
have
multiplied
over
our
heads
and
our
guilt
has
mounted
up
to
the
heavens
7
From
the
days
of
our
forefathers
until
this
day
our
guilt
has
been
great
and
because
of
our
errors
we
our
kings
and
our
priests
have
been
given
into
the
hand
of
the
kings
of
the
lands
to
the
sword
to
captivity
to
plunder
and
to
disgrace
as
is
the
case
today
8
But
now
for
a
brief
moment
favor
has
come
from
Jehovah
our
God
by
letting
a
remnant
escape
and
by
giving
us
a
secure
position
in
his
holy
place
to
make
our
eyes
shine
O
our
God
and
to
revive
us
a
little
in
our
slavery
9
For
although
we
are
slaves
our
God
has
not
abandoned
us
in
our
slavery
but
he
has
extended
his
loyal
love
toward
us
before
the
kings
of
Persia
to
revive
us
so
as
to
raise
up
the
house
of
our
God
and
to
restore
its
ruins
and
to
give
us
a
stone
wall
in
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem
10
But
now
what
can
we
say
O
our
God
after
this
For
we
have
left
your
commandments
11
which
you
gave
us
through
your
servants
the
prophets
saying
The
land
that
you
are
going
in
to
take
possession
of
is
an
impure
land
because
of
the
impurity
of
the
peoples
of
the
lands
because
of
their
detestable
practices
with
which
they
have
filled
it
from
end
to
end
with
their
uncleanness
12
Therefore
do
not
give
your
daughters
to
their
sons
neither
accept
their
daughters
for
your
sons
and
you
must
never
seek
their
peace
and
their
prosperity
so
that
you
may
grow
strong
and
eat
the
good
of
the
land
and
take
possession
of
it
for
your
sons
forever
13
And
after
all
that
has
come
upon
us
for
our
bad
deeds
and
our
great
guilt—for
you
O
our
God
have
not
dealt
with
us
according
to
our
error
and
you
have
allowed
those
of
us
here
to
escape—
14
are
we
to
break
your
commandments
again
and
form
marriage
alliances
with
the
peoples
who
practice
these
detestable
things
Would
you
not
become
so
angry
with
us
that
you
would
completely
destroy
us
leaving
no
remnant
or
survivor
15
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
you
are
righteous
for
we
have
survived
as
a
remnant
to
this
day
Here
we
are
before
you
in
our
guilt
for
it
is
impossible
to
stand
before
you
because
of
this
1
While
Ezra
was
praying
and
making
confession
weeping
and
lying
prostrate
before
the
house
of
the
true
God
a
large
crowd
of
men
women
and
children
of
Israel
gathered
around
him
for
the
people
were
weeping
profusely
2
Then
Shecaniah
the
son
of
Jehiel
of
the
sons
of
Elam
said
to
Ezra
We
have
acted
unfaithfully
against
our
God
by
marrying
foreign
women
from
the
peoples
of
the
land
Despite
this
there
is
still
hope
for
Israel
3
Now
let
us
make
a
covenant
with
our
God
to
send
away
all
the
wives
and
those
born
from
them
in
harmony
with
the
direction
of
Jehovah
and
of
those
who
have
reverence
for
the
commandment
of
our
God
Let
us
act
according
to
the
Law
4
Get
up
for
this
matter
is
your
responsibility
and
we
are
with
you
Be
strong
and
take
action
5
At
that
Ezra
rose
and
had
the
chiefs
of
the
priests
the
Levites
and
all
Israel
take
an
oath
to
do
what
had
been
said
So
they
took
an
oath
6
Ezra
now
got
up
from
before
the
house
of
the
true
God
and
went
to
the
chamber
of
Jehohanan
the
son
of
Eliashib
Although
he
went
there
he
ate
no
food
and
drank
no
water
for
he
was
in
mourning
because
of
the
unfaithfulness
of
the
exiled
people
7
Then
they
made
a
proclamation
throughout
Judah
and
Jerusalem
that
all
the
former
exiles
gather
together
at
Jerusalem
8
and
according
to
the
decision
of
the
princes
and
the
elders
anyone
who
did
not
come
within
three
days
time
would
have
all
his
goods
confiscated
and
he
would
be
banished
from
the
congregation
of
the
exiled
people
9
So
all
the
men
of
Judah
and
Benjamin
gathered
together
at
Jerusalem
within
three
days
that
is
in
the
ninth
month
on
the
20th
day
of
the
month
All
the
people
were
sitting
in
a
courtyard
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
shivering
because
of
the
matter
at
hand
and
because
of
the
heavy
rain
10
Then
Ezra
the
priest
rose
and
said
to
them
You
have
acted
unfaithfully
by
marrying
foreign
women
and
so
you
have
added
to
the
guilt
of
Israel
11
Now
make
confession
to
Jehovah
the
God
of
your
forefathers
and
do
his
will
Separate
yourselves
from
the
peoples
of
the
land
and
from
these
foreign
wives
12
To
this
the
whole
congregation
answered
with
a
loud
voice
It
is
our
duty
to
do
exactly
as
you
say
13
However
there
are
many
people
and
it
is
the
rainy
season
It
is
not
possible
to
stand
outside
and
the
matter
will
not
take
just
one
or
two
days
for
we
have
rebelled
extensively
in
this
matter
14
So
please
let
our
princes
represent
the
entire
congregation
and
let
all
those
in
our
cities
who
have
married
foreign
women
come
at
an
appointed
time
along
with
the
elders
and
judges
of
each
city
until
we
turn
back
the
burning
anger
of
our
God
from
us
concerning
this
matter
15
However
Jonathan
the
son
of
Asahel
and
Jahzeiah
the
son
of
Tikvah
objected
to
this
and
the
Levites
Meshullam
and
Shabbethai
supported
them
16
But
the
former
exiles
did
what
was
agreed
on
and
Ezra
the
priest
and
the
family
heads
of
their
paternal
houses
all
designated
by
name
convened
separately
on
the
first
day
of
the
tenth
month
to
look
into
the
matter
17
and
by
the
first
day
of
the
first
month
they
finished
dealing
with
all
the
men
who
had
married
foreign
women
18
And
it
was
discovered
that
some
of
the
sons
of
the
priests
had
married
foreign
women
of
the
sons
of
Jeshua
the
son
of
Jehozadak
and
his
brothers
Maaseiah
Eliezer
Jarib
and
Gedaliah
19
But
they
promised
to
send
their
wives
away
and
since
they
were
guilty
they
would
offer
a
ram
of
the
flock
for
their
guilt
20
Of

along
with
their
sons
1
The
words
of
Nehemiah
the
son
of
Hacaliah
Now
in
the
month
of
Chislev
in
the
20th
year
I
was
in
Shushan
the
citadel
2
At
that
time
Hanani
one
of
my
brothers
arrived
with
other
men
from
Judah
and
I
asked
them
about
the
remaining
Jews
who
had
escaped
the
captivity
and
also
about
Jerusalem
3
They
replied
Those
remaining
there
in
the
province
who
have
survived
the
captivity
are
in
a
terrible
situation
and
in
disgrace
The
walls
of
Jerusalem
are
broken
down
and
its
gates
have
been
burned
with
fire
4
As
soon
as
I
heard
these
words
I
sat
down
and
began
to
weep
and
mourn
for
days
and
I
kept
fasting
and
praying
before
the
God
of
the
heavens
5
I
said
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
heavens
the
great
and
awe-inspiring
God
who
keeps
his
covenant
and
shows
loyal
love
to
those
who
love
him
and
keep
his
commandments
6
please
let
your
ear
be
attentive
and
your
eyes
open
to
listen
to
the
prayer
of
your
servant
that
I
am
praying
to
you
today
day
and
night
concerning
your
servants
the
Israelites
all
the
while
confessing
the
sins
that
the
people
of
Israel
have
committed
against
you
We
have
sinned
both
I
and
the
house
of
my
father
7
We
have
certainly
acted
corruptly
against
you
by
not
keeping
the
commandments
regulations
and
judicial
decisions
that
you
gave
to
your
servant
Moses
8
Remember
please
the
word
that
you
commanded
your
servant
Moses
If
you
act
unfaithfully
I
will
scatter
you
among
the
peoples
9
But
if
you
return
to
me
and
observe
my
commandments
and
obey
them
though
your
dispersed
people
should
be
at
the
end
of
the
heavens
I
will
gather
them
from
there
and
bring
them
to
the
place
that
I
have
chosen
to
have
my
name
reside
10
They
are
your
servants
and
your
people
whom
you
redeemed
by
your
great
power
and
by
your
mighty
hand
11
O
Jehovah
please
let
your
ear
be
attentive
to
the
prayer
of
your
servant
and
to
the
prayer
of
your
servants
who
take
delight
in
fearing
your
name
and
please
grant
success
to
your
servant
today
and
may
this
man
show
me
compassion
Now
I
was
cupbearer
to
the
king
1
In
the
month
of
Nisan
in
the
20th
year
of
King
Artaxerxes
wine
was
set
before
him
and
as
usual
I
took
up
the
wine
and
gave
it
to
the
king
But
I
had
never
been
gloomy
in
his
presence
2
So
the
king
said
to
me
Why
do
you
look
so
gloomy
when
you
are
not
sick
This
can
be
nothing
but
gloominess
of
heart
At
this
I
became
very
frightened
3
Then
I
said
to
the
king
Long
live
the
king
Why
should
I
not
look
gloomy
when
the
city
the
place
where
my
forefathers
are
buried
lies
in
ruins
and
its
gates
have
been
consumed
by
fire
4
The
king
then
said
to
me
What
is
it
that
you
are
seeking
At
once
I
prayed
to
the
God
of
the
heavens
5
I
then
said
to
the
king
If
it
pleases
the
king
and
if
your
servant
has
found
favor
with
you
send
me
to
Judah
to
the
city
where
my
forefathers
are
buried
so
that
I
may
rebuild
it
6
Then
the
king
with
his
royal
consort
sitting
beside
him
said
to
me
How
long
will
your
journey
be
and
when
will
you
return
So
it
pleased
the
king
to
send
me
and
I
gave
him
a
set
time
7
Then
I
said
to
the
king
If
it
pleases
the
king
let
letters
be
given
me
for
the
governors
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
granting
me
safe
passage
until
I
reach
Judah
8
as
well
as
a
letter
to
Asaph
the
keeper
of
the
Royal
Park
so
that
he
may
give
me
timber
for
beams
for
the
gates
of
the
Fortress
of
the
House
and
for
the
walls
of
the
city
and
for
the
house
where
I
will
go
So
the
king
gave
them
to
me
for
the
good
hand
of
my
God
was
upon
me
9
Eventually
I
came
to
the
governors
of
the
region
Beyond
the
River
and
gave
them
the
kings
letters
The
king
also
sent
with
me
army
chiefs
and
horsemen
10
When
Sanballat
the
Horonite
and
Tobiah
the
Ammonite
official
heard
about
it
they
were
very
displeased
that
someone
had
come
to
do
something
good
for
the
people
of
Israel
11
At
length
I
came
to
Jerusalem
and
I
stayed
there
for
three
days
12
I
rose
up
by
night
I
and
a
few
men
with
me
and
I
did
not
tell
anyone
what
my
God
had
put
into
my
heart
to
do
for
Jerusalem
and
there
was
no
animal
with
me
except
the
one
I
was
riding
13
And
I
went
out
at
night
through
the
Valley
Gate
passing
in
front
of
the
Fountain
of
the
Big
Snake
to
the
Gate
of
the
Ash
Heaps
and
I
inspected
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
that
were
broken
down
and
its
gates
that
had
been
consumed
by
fire
14
And
I
passed
along
to
the
Fountain
Gate
and
to
the
Kings
Pool
and
there
was
not
enough
space
for
the
animal
I
was
riding
to
pass
15
But
I
continued
up
the
valley
by
night
and
I
kept
inspecting
the
wall
after
which
I
came
back
and
entered
through
the
Valley
Gate
and
then
I
returned
16
The
deputy
rulers
did
not
know
where
I
had
gone
and
what
I
was
doing
for
I
had
not
yet
said
anything
to
the
Jews
the
priests
the
nobles
the
deputy
rulers
and
the
rest
of
the
workers
17
Finally
I
said
to
them
You
can
see
what
a
terrible
situation
we
are
in
how
Jerusalem
lies
in
ruins
and
its
gates
have
been
burned
with
fire
Come
let
us
rebuild
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
so
that
this
disgrace
will
not
continue
18
Then
I
told
them
of
how
the
good
hand
of
my
God
was
upon
me
and
also
of
the
words
that
the
king
had
spoken
to
me
At
this
they
said
Let
us
get
up
and
build
So
they
strengthened
themselves
for
the
good
work
19
Now
when
Sanballat
the
Horonite
Tobiah
the
Ammonite
official
and
Geshem
the
Arabian
heard
of
it
they
began
to
mock
us
and
show
us
their
contempt
and
say
What
are
you
doing
Are
you
rebelling
against
the
king
20
However
I
replied
The
God
of
the
heavens
is
the
One
who
will
grant
us
success
and
we
his
servants
will
get
up
and
build
but
you
have
neither
share
nor
claim
nor
memorial
in
Jerusalem
1
Eliashib
the
high
priest
and
his
brothers
the
priests
got
up
to

and

chamber

And
between
the
roof
chamber
of
the
corner
and
the
Sheep
Gate
the
goldsmiths
and
the
traders
did
repair
work
1
Now
as
soon
as
Sanballat
heard
that
we
were
rebuilding
the
wall
he
became
angry
and
very
upset
and
he
kept
mocking
the
Jews
2
And
in
the
presence
of
his
brothers
and
the
army
of
Samaria
he
said
What
are
the
feeble
Jews
doing
Will
they
do
this
by
themselves
Will
they
offer
sacrifices
Will
they
finish
up
in
a
day
Will
they
bring
the
charred
stones
to
life
out
of
the
heaps
of
dusty
rubble
3
Now
Tobiah
the
Ammonite
who
was
standing
beside
him
said
If
even
a
fox
would
climb
up
on
what
they
are
building
it
would
knock
down
their
stone
wall
4
Hear
O
our
God
for
we
are
being
treated
with
contempt
and
make
their
reproach
return
on
their
own
heads
and
give
them
over
as
plunder
in
a
land
of
captivity
5
And
do
not
cover
over
their
guilt
or
let
their
sin
be
erased
from
before
you
for
they
have
insulted
the
builders
6
So
we
kept
building
the
wall
and
the
entire
wall
was
joined
together
and
rebuilt
up
to
half
its
height
and
the
people
continued
to
put
their
heart
into
the
work
7
Now
as
soon
as
Sanballat
Tobiah
the
Arabians
the
Ammonites
and
the
Ashdodites
heard
that
the
repairing
of
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
was
progressing
and
that
the
gaps
were
being
filled
in
they
became
very
angry
8
They
conspired
together
to
come
and
fight
against
Jerusalem
and
to
create
a
disturbance
in
it
9
But
we
prayed
to
our
God
and
kept
a
guard
posted
against
them
day
and
night
10
However
people
of
Judah
were
saying
The
strength
of
the
laborers
has
failed
and
there
is
so
much
rubble
we
will
never
be
able
to
build
the
wall
11
And
our
enemies
kept
saying
Before
they
know
it
or
see
us
we
will
come
right
in
among
them
and
kill
them
and
stop
the
work
12
Whenever
the
Jews
living
near
them
came
in
they
told
us
again
and
again
They
will
come
at
us
from
all
directions
13
So
I
kept
men
posted
at
the
lowest
parts
of
the
space
behind
the
wall
at
the
exposed
places
and
I
posted
them
by
families
with
their
swords
their
lances
and
their
bows
14
When
I
saw
their
fear
I
immediately
rose
and
said
to
the
nobles
and
the
deputy
rulers
and
the
rest
of
the
people
Do
not
be
afraid
of
them
Remember
Jehovah
who
is
great
and
awe-inspiring
and
fight
for
your
brothers
your
sons
and
daughters
your
wives
and
homes
15
Now
after
our
enemies
heard
that
what
they
were
doing
had
become
known
to
us
and
that
the
true
God
had
frustrated
their
plan
we
all
went
back
to
work
on
the
wall
16
From
that
day
forward
half
of
my
men
would
do
the
work
and
half
of
them
would
hold
the
lances
the
shields
the
bows
and
the
coats
of
mail
And
the
princes
stood
behind
the
whole
house
of
Judah
17
who
were
building
the
wall
Those
who
were
carrying
the
loads
did
the
work
with
one
hand
while
holding
a
weapon
in
the
other
hand
18
And
each
of
the
builders
had
a
sword
strapped
to
his
hip
while
building
and
the
one
to
blow
the
horn
stood
beside
me
19
I
then
said
to
the
nobles
and
the
deputy
rulers
and
the
rest
of
the
people
The
work
is
large
and
extensive
and
we
are
spread
out
on
the
wall
far
apart
from
one
another
20
When
you
hear
the
sound
of
the
horn
gather
together
to
where
we
are
Our
God
will
fight
for
us
21
So
we
kept
working
while
the
other
half
were
holding
the
lances
from
the
break
of
dawn
until
the
stars
came
out
22
At
that
time
I
said
to
the
people
Let
the
men
each
along
with
his
attendant
spend
the
night
inside
Jerusalem
and
they
will
guard
us
by
night
and
work
during
the
day
23
So
neither
I
nor
my
brothers
my
attendants
and
the
guards
who
followed
me
ever
took
off
our
garments
and
each
of
us
kept
his
weapon
in
his
right
hand
1
However
there
was
a
great
outcry
from
the
people
and
their
wives
against
their
Jewish
brothers
2
Some
were
saying
We
are
many
with
our
sons
and
our
daughters
We
must
get
grain
in
order
to
eat
and
stay
alive
3
Others
were
saying
We
are
giving
our
fields
and
our
vineyards
and
our
houses
as
security
to
get
grain
during
the
food
shortage
4
Still
others
were
saying
We
have
borrowed
money
on
our
fields
and
our
vineyards
for
the
kings
tribute
5
Now
we
are
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
our
brothers
and
our
children
are
just
like
their
children
yet
we
have
to
subject
our
sons
and
daughters
to
slavery
and
some
of
our
daughters
are
already
in
slavery
But
we
are
powerless
to
stop
this
because
our
fields
and
our
vineyards
belong
to
others
6
I
became
very
angry
when
I
heard
their
outcry
and
these
words
7
So
I
considered
these
things
in
my
heart
and
I
took
issue
with
the
nobles
and
the
deputy
rulers
and
said
to
them
Each
one
of
you
is
demanding
interest
from
your
own
brother
Further
I
arranged
for
a
great
assembly
because
of
them
8
And
I
said
to
them
To
the
extent
possible
we
have
bought
back
our
own
Jewish
brothers
who
were
sold
to
the
nations
but
will
you
now
sell
your
own
brothers
and
are
they
to
be
sold
back
to
us
At
this
they
became
speechless
and
they
could
find
nothing
to
say
9
Then
I
said
What
you
are
doing
is
not
good
Should
you
not
walk
in
the
fear
of
our
God
so
that
the
nations
our
enemies
cannot
reproach
us
10
Moreover
I
my
brothers
and
my
attendants
are
lending
them
money
and
grain
Let
us
please
stop
this
lending
on
interest
11
Please
restore
to
them
on
this
very
day
their
fields
their
vineyards
their
olive
groves
and
their
houses
as
well
as
the
hundredth
of
the
money
the
grain
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
that
you
are
demanding
as
interest
from
them
12
To
this
they
said
We
will
restore
these
things
to
them
and
ask
nothing
back
We
will
do
precisely
as
you
say
So
I
called
the
priests
and
made
those
men
swear
to
keep
this
promise
13
Also
I
shook
out
the
folds
of
my
garment
and
said
In
this
manner
may
the
true
God
shake
out
from
his
house
and
from
his
possessions
every
man
who
does
not
carry
out
this
promise
and
in
this
manner
may
he
be
shaken
out
and
emptied
To
this
all
the
congregation
said
Amen
And
they
praised
Jehovah
and
the
people
did
as
they
promised
14
Moreover
from
the
day
that
he
commissioned
me
to
become
their
governor
in
the
land
of
Judah
from
the
20th
year
to
the
32nd
year
of
King
Artaxerxes
12
years
neither
I
nor
my
brothers
ate
the
food
allowance
due
the
governor
15
But
the
former
governors
who
were
before
me
had
burdened
the
people
and
had
been
taking
from
them
40
silver
shekels
for
bread
and
wine
each
day
Also
their
attendants
had
oppressed
the
people
But
I
did
not
do
that
because
of
the
fear
of
God
16
Furthermore
I
took
a
hand
in
the
work
on
this
wall
and
not
a
field
did
we
acquire
all
my
attendants
were
gathered
there
for
the
work
17
There
were
150
Jews
and
deputy
rulers
dining
at
my
table
as
well
as
those
who
came
to
us
from
the
nations
18
Every
day
one
bull
six
choice
sheep
and
birds
were
prepared
for
me
and
once
every
ten
days
we
had
all
sorts
of
wine
in
abundance
Despite
all
this
I
did
not
demand
the
food
allowance
due
the
governor
because
the
people
were
already
bearing
their
burden
of
service
19
Do
remember
me
favorably
O
my
God
for
all
that
I
have
done
in
behalf
of
this
people
1
Now
as
soon
as
Sanballat
Tobiah
Geshem
the
Arabian
and
the
rest
of
our
enemies
were
told
that
I
had
rebuilt
the
wall
and
that
there
were
no
gaps
left
in
it
although
up
to
that
time
I
had
not
set
up
the
doors
in
the
gates
2
Sanballat
and
Geshem
immediately
sent
this
message
to
me
Come
and
let
us
set
a
time
to
meet
together
in
the
villages
of
the
Valley
Plain
of
Ono
But
they
were
scheming
to
harm
me
3
So
I
sent
messengers
to
them
saying
I
am
engaged
in
a
great
work
and
I
am
not
able
to
go
down
Why
should
the
work
stop
while
I
leave
it
to
come
to
you
4
They
sent
me
the
same
message
four
times
and
I
gave
them
the
same
reply
each
time
5
Then
Sanballat
sent
his
attendant
to
me
with
the
same
message
a
fifth
time
with
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
6
There
it
was
written
Among
the
nations
it
has
been
heard
and
Geshem
is
also
saying
it
that
you
and
the
Jews
are
scheming
to
rebel
That
is
why
you
are
building
the
wall
and
according
to
these
reports
you
are
to
become
their
king
7
Also
you
have
appointed
prophets
to
proclaim
about
you
throughout
Jerusalem
There
is
a
king
in
Judah
And
now
these
things
will
be
told
to
the
king
So
come
and
let
us
discuss
this
together
8
However
I
sent
him
this
reply
None
of
the
things
you
are
saying
have
taken
place
you
are
making
them
up
out
of
your
own
imagination
9
For
they
were
all
trying
to
frighten
us
saying
Their
hands
will
slacken
in
the
work
and
it
will
not
be
done
Now
I
pray
strengthen
my
hands
10
Then
I
went
to
the
house
of
Shemaiah
the
son
of
Delaiah
the
son
of
Mehetabel
while
he
was
confined
there
He
said
Let
us
set
a
time
to
meet
at
the
house
of
the
true
God
within
the
temple
and
let
us
close
the
doors
of
the
temple
for
they
are
coming
to
kill
you
They
are
coming
to
kill
you
by
night
11
But
I
said
Should
a
man
like
me
run
away
Can
a
man
like
me
go
into
the
temple
and
live
I
will
not
go
in
12
Then
I
realized
that
God
had
not
sent
him
but
that
Tobiah
and
Sanballat
had
hired
him
to
speak
this
prophecy
against
me
13
He
had
been
hired
to
frighten
me
and
to
cause
me
to
sin
so
that
they
would
have
grounds
to
damage
my
reputation
in
order
to
reproach
me
14
Do
remember
O
my
God
Tobiah
and
Sanballat
and
these
deeds
and
also
Noadiah
the
prophetess
and
the
rest
of
the
prophets
who
were
constantly
trying
to
frighten
me
15
So
the
wall
was
completed
on
the
25th
day
of
Elul
in
52
days
16
As
soon
as
all
our
enemies
heard
of
it
and
all
the
surrounding
nations
saw
it
they
became
greatly
ashamed
and
they
realized
that
it
was
with
our
Gods
help
that
this
work
had
been
done
17
In
those
days
the
nobles
of
Judah
were
sending
many
letters
to
Tobiah
and
Tobiah
would
reply
to
them
18
Many
in
Judah
swore
allegiance
to
him
for
he
was
a
son-in-law
of
Shecaniah
the
son
of
Arah
and
his
son
Jehohanan
had
married
the
daughter
of
Meshullam
the
son
of
Berechiah
19
Also
they
would
constantly
tell
me
good
things
about
him
and
then
report
to
him
what
I
said
Then
Tobiah
would
send
letters
to
frighten
me
1
As
soon
as
the
wall
had
been
rebuilt
I
set
up
the
doors
then
the
gatekeepers
the
singers
and
the
Levites
were
appointed
2
I
then
put
my
brother
Hanani
in
charge
of
Jerusalem
along
with
Hananiah
the
chief
of
the
Fortress
for
he
was
a
most
trustworthy
man
and
feared
the
true
God
more
than
many
others
3
So
I
said
to
them
The
gates
of
Jerusalem
should
not
be
opened
until
the
heat
of
the
day
and
while
they
are
standing
guard
they
should
shut
the
doors
and
bolt
them
And
assign
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
as
guards
each
to
his
assigned
guardpost
and
each
in
front
of
his
own
house
4
Now
the
city
was
spacious
and
large
and
there
were
few
people
inside
it
and
the
houses
had
not
been
rebuilt
5
But
my
God
put
it
into
my
heart
to
gather
together
the
nobles
and
the
deputy
rulers
and
the
people
to
be
enrolled
genealogically
Then
I
found
the
book
of
genealogical
enrollment
of
those
who
first
came
up
and
I
found
written
in
it
6
And
these
were
the
people
of
the
province
who
came
up
out
of
the
captivity
of
the
exiles
those
whom
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
had
exiled
and
who
later
returned
to
Jerusalem
and
Judah
each
to
his
own
city
7

came

All
the

were
392
61
And
these
went
up
from
Tel-melah
Tel-harsha
Cherub
Addon
and

but
they
were
unable

verify
their

house

were
Israelites
62
the

64
These
looked
for
their
records
to
establish
their
genealogy
but
they
could
not
be
found
so
they
were
disqualified
from
the
priesthood
65
The
governor
told
them
that
they
should
not
eat
from
the
most
holy
things
until
there
was
a
priest
who
could
consult
the
Urim
and
Thummim
66
The
total
number
of
the
entire
congregation
was
42360
67
apart

70
Some

the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
contributed
to
the
work
The
governor
gave
to
the
treasury
1000
gold
drachmas
50
bowls
and
530
priests
robes
71
And
some
of
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
gave
to
the
project
treasury
20000
gold
drachmas
and
2200
silver
minas
72
And
the
rest
of
the
people
gave
20000
gold
drachmas
2000
silver
minas
and
67
priests
robes
73
And
the
priests
the
Levites
the
gatekeepers
the
singers
some
of
the
people
the
temple
servants
and
all
the
rest
of
Israel
settled
in
their
cities
When
the
seventh
month
arrived
the
Israelites
had
settled
in
their
cities
1
All
the
people
then
gathered
with
one
accord
at
the
public
square
in
front
of
the
Water
Gate
and
they
told
Ezra
the
copyist
to
bring
the
book
of
the
Law
of
Moses
which
Jehovah
had
commanded
Israel
2
So
Ezra
the
priest
brought
the
Law
before
the
congregation
of
men
women
and
all
who
could
listen
with
understanding
on
the
first
day
of
the
seventh
month
3
And
he
read
aloud
from
it
before
the
public
square
in
front
of
the
Water
Gate
from
daybreak
until
midday
to
the
men
the
women
and
all
who
could
understand
and
the
people
listened
attentively
to
the
book
of
the
Law
4
And
Ezra
the
copyist
was
standing
on
a
wooden
podium
made
for
the
occasion
and
standing
alongside
him
on
his
right
were
Mattithiah
Shema
Anaiah
Uriah
Hilkiah
and
Maaseiah
and
on
his
left
were
Pedaiah
Mishael
Malchijah
Hashum
Hash-baddanah
Zechariah
and
Meshullam
5
Ezra
opened
the
book
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
for
he
was
above
all
the
people
As
he
opened
it
all
the
people
stood
up
6
Then
Ezra
praised
Jehovah
the
true
God
the
great
One
at
which
all
the
people
answered
Amen
Amen
and
lifted
up
their
hands
They
then
bowed
low
and
prostrated
themselves
to
Jehovah
with
their
faces
to
the
ground
7
And
Jeshua
Bani
Sherebiah
Jamin
Akkub
Shabbethai
Hodiah
Maaseiah
Kelita
Azariah
Jozabad
Hanan
and
Pelaiah
who
were
Levites
were
explaining
the
Law
to
the
people
while
the
people
remained
standing
8
And
they
continued
reading
aloud
from
the
book
from
the
Law
of
the
true
God
clearly
explaining
it
and
putting
meaning
into
it
so
they
helped
the
people
to
understand
what
was
being
read
9
And
Nehemiah
who
was
then
the
governor
Ezra
the
priest
and
copyist
and
the
Levites
who
were
instructing
the
people
said
to
all
the
people
This
day
is
holy
to
Jehovah
your
God
Do
not
mourn
or
weep
For
all
the
people
were
weeping
as
they
heard
the
words
of
the
Law
10
He
said
to
them
Go
eat
the
choice
things
and
drink
what
is
sweet
and
send
portions
of
food
to
those
who
have
nothing
prepared
for
this
day
is
holy
to
our
Lord
and
do
not
feel
sad
for
the
joy
of
Jehovah
is
your
stronghold
11
And
the
Levites
were
calming
all
the
people
saying
Be
quiet
for
this
day
is
holy
and
do
not
feel
sad
12
So
all
the
people
went
away
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
to
send
out
portions
of
food
and
to
carry
on
a
great
rejoicing
for
they
understood
the
words
that
had
been
made
known
to
them
13
And
on
the
second
day
the
heads
of
the
paternal
houses
of
all
the
people
the
priests
and
the
Levites
gathered
around
Ezra
the
copyist
to
gain
further
insight
into
the
words
of
the
Law
14
Then
they
found
written
in
the
Law
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
through
Moses
that
the
Israelites
should
dwell
in
booths
during
the
festival
in
the
seventh
month
15
and
that
they
should
make
proclamation
and
announce
throughout
all
their
cities
and
throughout
Jerusalem
saying
Go
out
to
the
mountainous
region
and
bring
in
leafy
branches
from
olive
trees
pine
trees
myrtle
and
palm
trees
and
the
leafy
branches
of
other
trees
to
make
booths
according
to
what
is
written
16
So
the
people
went
out
and
brought
them
in
to
make
booths
for
themselves
each
one
on
his
roof
as
well
as
in
their
courtyards
in
the
courtyards
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
in
the
public
square
of
the
Water
Gate
and
in
the
public
square
of
the
Gate
of
Ephraim
17
Thus
all
those
of
the
congregation
who
had
come
back
from
the
captivity
made
booths
and
were
dwelling
in
the
booths
for
the
Israelites
had
not
done
it
this
way
from
the
days
of
Joshua
the
son
of
Nun
until
that
day
so
that
there
was
very
great
rejoicing
18
And
day
by
day
there
was
a
reading
from
the
book
of
the
Law
of
the
true
God
from
the
first
day
until
the
last
day
And
they
held
the
festival
for
seven
days
and
there
was
a
solemn
assembly
on
the
eighth
day
as
was
required
1
On
the
24th
day
of
this
month
the
Israelites
assembled
they
were
fasting
with
sackcloth
and
dust
on
themselves
2
Those
of
Israelite
descent
then
separated
themselves
from
all
the
foreigners
and
they
stood
and
confessed
their
own
sins
and
the
errors
of
their
fathers
3
Then
they
stood
up
at
their
place
and
read
aloud
from
the
book
of
the
Law
of
Jehovah
their
God
for
a
fourth
of
the
day
and
for
another
fourth
of
it
they
were
confessing
and
bowing
down
to
Jehovah
their
God
4
Jeshua
Bani
Kadmiel
Shebaniah
Bunni
Sherebiah
Bani
and
Chenani
stood
on
the
raised
platform
of
the
Levites
and
they
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
to
Jehovah
their
God
5
And
the
Levites
Jeshua
Kadmiel
Bani
Hashabneiah
Sherebiah
Hodiah
Shebaniah
and
Pethahiah
said
Stand
up
and
praise
Jehovah
your
God
throughout
all
eternity
And
let
them
praise
your
glorious
name
which
is
exalted
above
all
blessing
and
praise
6
You
alone
are
Jehovah
you
made
the
heavens
yes
the
heaven
of
the
heavens
and
all
their
army
the
earth
and
all
that
is
on
it
the
seas
and
all
that
is
in
them
And
you
preserve
all
of
them
alive
and
the
army
of
the
heavens
are
bowing
down
to
you
7
You
are
Jehovah
the
true
God
who
chose
Abram
and
brought
him
out
of
Ur
of
the
Chaldeans
and
gave
him
the
name
Abraham
8
You
found
his
heart
faithful
before
you
so
you
made
a
covenant
with
him
to
give
him
the
land
of
the
Canaanites
the
Hittites
the
Amorites
the
Perizzites
the
Jebusites
and
the
Girgashites
to
give
it
to
his
offspring
and
you
kept
your
promises
because
you
are
righteous
9
So
you
saw
the
affliction
of
our
forefathers
in
Egypt
and
you
heard
their
outcry
at
the
Red
Sea
10
Then
you
performed
signs
and
miracles
against
Pharaoh
and
all
his
servants
and
all
the
people
of
his
land
for
you
knew
that
they
acted
presumptuously
against
them
You
made
a
name
for
yourself
that
remains
to
this
day
11
And
you
split
the
sea
before
them
so
that
they
crossed
through
the
sea
on
the
dry
land
and
you
hurled
their
pursuers
into
the
depths
like
a
stone
thrown
into
the
turbulent
waters
12
You
led
them
by
day
with
a
pillar
of
cloud
and
by
night
with
a
pillar
of
fire
to
light
up
for
them
the
way
they
should
go
13
And
you
came
down
on
Mount
Sinai
and
spoke
with
them
from
heaven
and
gave
them
righteous
judgments
laws
of
truth
good
regulations
and
commandments
14
You
made
known
to
them
your
holy
Sabbath
and
you
gave
them
commandments
regulations
and
a
law
through
your
servant
Moses
15
You
gave
them
bread
from
heaven
when
they
were
hungry
and
you
brought
water
out
of
the
crag
when
they
were
thirsty
and
you
told
them
to
enter
and
take
possession
of
the
land
that
you
had
sworn
to
give
to
them
16
But
they
our
forefathers
acted
presumptuously
and
became
stubborn
and
they
would
not
listen
to
your
commandments
17
They
refused
to
listen
and
they
did
not
remember
your
extraordinary
acts
that
you
performed
among
them
but
they
became
stubborn
and
appointed
a
head
to
return
to
their
slavery
in
Egypt
But
you
are
a
God
ready
to
forgive
compassionate
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
abundant
in
loyal
love
and
you
did
not
abandon
them
18
Even
when
they
made
for
themselves
a
metal
statue
of
a
calf
and
were
saying
This
is
your
God
who
led
you
up
out
of
Egypt

and
they
committed
great
acts
of
disrespect
19
even
then
you
in
your
great
mercy
did
not
abandon
them
in
the
wilderness
The
pillar
of
cloud
did
not
depart
from
over
them
by
day
to
lead
them
in
the
way
nor
the
pillar
of
fire
by
night
to
light
up
for
them
the
way
they
should
go
20
And
you
gave
your
good
spirit
to
give
them
insight
and
you
did
not
hold
back
your
manna
from
their
mouth
and
you
gave
them
water
when
they
were
thirsty
21
For
40
years
you
provided
them
with
food
in
the
wilderness
They
lacked
nothing
Their
garments
did
not
wear
out
and
their
feet
did
not
become
swollen
22
You
gave
them
kingdoms
and
peoples
apportioning
them
piece
by
piece
so
that
they
took
possession
of
the
land
of
Sihon
that
is
the
land
of
the
king
of
Heshbon
as
well
as
the
land
of
Og
the
king
of
Bashan
23
And
you
made
their
sons
as
numerous
as
the
stars
of
the
heavens
Then
you
brought
them
into
the
land
that
you
had
promised
their
forefathers
that
they
should
enter
and
possess
24
So
their
sons
went
in
and
took
possession
of
the
land
and
you
subdued
before
them
the
Canaanites
who
were
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
and
you
gave
them
into
their
hand
both
their
kings
and
the
peoples
of
the
land
to
do
with
them
as
they
pleased
25
And
they
captured
fortified
cities
and
a
fertile
land
and
they
took
possession
of
houses
full
of
all
sorts
of
good
things
cisterns
already
dug
vineyards
olive
groves
and
fruit
trees
in
abundance
So
they
ate
and
grew
satisfied
and
fat
and
they
basked
in
your
great
goodness
26
However
they
became
disobedient
and
rebelled
against
you
and
turned
their
back
on
your
Law
They
killed
your
prophets
who
warned
them
so
as
to
bring
them
back
to
you
and
they
committed
acts
of
great
disrespect
27
For
this
you
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
their
adversaries
who
kept
causing
them
distress
But
they
would
cry
out
to
you
in
the
time
of
their
distress
and
you
would
hear
from
the
heavens
and
because
of
your
great
mercy
you
would
give
them
saviors
to
rescue
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
adversaries
28
But
as
soon
as
they
had
relief
they
would
again
do
what
is
bad
before
you
and
you
would
abandon
them
to
the
hand
of
their
enemies
who
would
dominate
them
Then
they
would
return
and
call
to
you
for
help
and
you
would
hear
from
the
heavens
and
rescue
them
time
and
again
because
of
your
great
mercy
29
Although
you
would
warn
them
so
as
to
bring
them
back
to
your
Law
they
behaved
presumptuously
and
refused
to
listen
to
your
commandments
and
they
sinned
against
your
regulations
by
which
a
man
will
live
if
he
observes
them
But
they
stubbornly
turned
their
back
and
stiffened
their
neck
and
they
refused
to
listen
30
You
extended
patience
to
them
for
many
years
and
kept
warning
them
by
your
spirit
through
your
prophets
but
they
refused
to
listen
Finally
you
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
the
peoples
of
the
lands
31
And
in
your
great
mercy
you
did
not
exterminate
them
or
abandon
them
for
you
are
a
compassionate
and
merciful
God
32
And
now
O
our
God
the
God
great
mighty
and
awe-inspiring
who
has
kept
his
covenant
and
shown
loyal
love
do
not
treat
lightly
all
the
hardship
that
has
found
us
our
kings
our
princes
our
priests
our
prophets
our
forefathers
and
all
your
people
from
the
days
of
the
kings
of
Assyria
down
to
this
day
33
You
have
been
righteous
in
all
that
has
come
upon
us
for
you
have
acted
faithfully
but
we
are
the
ones
who
have
acted
wickedly
34
As
for
our
kings
our
princes
our
priests
and
our
forefathers
they
have
not
observed
your
Law
nor
paid
attention
to
your
commandments
or
to
your
reminders
by
which
you
warned
them
35
Even
when
they
were
in
their
kingdom
and
enjoying
the
abundant
goodness
that
you
gave
them
and
they
were
in
the
broad
and
fertile
land
that
you
bestowed
on
them
they
did
not
serve
you
and
did
not
turn
away
from
their
bad
practices
36
So
here
we
are
today
slaves—yes
slaves
in
the
land
that
you
gave
to
our
forefathers
to
eat
its
fruitage
and
its
good
things
37
Its
abundant
produce
is
for
the
kings
whom
you
have
put
over
us
because
of
our
sins
They
rule
over
our
bodies
and
over
our
livestock
as
they
see
fit
and
we
are
in
great
distress
38
So
in
view
of
all
this
we
are
making
a
binding
agreement
in
writing
and
it
is
attested
by
the
seal
of
our
princes
our
Levites
and
our
priests
1
Those
who
attested
it
by
putting
their
seal
to
it
were

The
rest
of
the
people—the
priests
the
Levites
the
gatekeepers
the
singers
the
temple
servants
and
everyone
who
separated
himself
from
the
peoples
of
the
lands
to
follow
the
Law
of
the
true
God
along
with
their
wives
their
sons
and
their
daughters
all
those
with
knowledge
and
understanding—
29
joined
their
brothers
their
prominent
men
and
bound
themselves
with
a
curse
and
an
oath
to
walk
in
the
Law
of
the
true
God
which
had
been
given
through
Moses
the
servant
of
the
true
God
and
to
observe
carefully
all
the
commandments
of
Jehovah
our
Lord
his
judgments
and
his
regulations
30
We
will
not
give
our
daughters
to
the
peoples
of
the
land
and
we
will
not
take
their
daughters
for
our
sons
31
If
the
peoples
of
the
land
bring
in
their
wares
and
every
kind
of
grain
to
sell
on
the
Sabbath
day
we
will
not
buy
anything
from
them
on
the
Sabbath
or
on
a
holy
day
We
will
also
forgo
the
produce
of
the
seventh
year
and
every
outstanding
debt
32
Also
we
imposed
the
obligation
on
ourselves
for
each
of
us
to
give
a
third
of
a
shekel
yearly
for
the
service
of
the
house
of
our
God
33
for
the
layer
bread
the
regular
grain
offering
the
regular
burnt
offering
of
the
Sabbaths
and
the
new
moons
and
for
the
appointed
feasts
for
the
holy
things
for
the
sin
offerings
to
make
atonement
for
Israel
and
for
all
the
work
of
the
house
of
our
God
34
Also
we
cast
lots
concerning
the
supply
of
the
wood
that
the
priests
the
Levites
and
the
people
should
bring
to
the
house
of
our
God
by
our
paternal
houses
at
the
appointed
times
year
by
year
to
burn
on
the
altar
of
Jehovah
our
God
according
to
what
is
written
in
the
Law
35
We
will
also
bring
the
first
ripe
fruits
of
our
land
and
the
first
ripe
fruits
of
every
sort
of
fruit
tree
year
by
year
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
36
as
well
as
the
firstborn
of
our
sons
and
of
our
livestock—according
to
what
is
written
in
the
Law—and
the
firstborn
of
our
herds
and
of
our
flocks
We
will
bring
them
to
the
house
of
our
God
to
the
priests
who
minister
at
the
house
of
our
God
37
Also
the
firstfruits
of
our
coarse
meal
our
contributions
the
fruitage
of
every
sort
of
tree
new
wine
and
oil
we
should
bring
to
the
priests
to
the
storerooms
of
the
house
of
our
God
along
with
the
tenth
from
our
land
to
the
Levites
for
the
Levites
are
the
ones
who
collect
the
tenths
in
all
our
agricultural
cities
38
And
the
priest
the
son
of
Aaron
must
be
with
the
Levites
when
the
Levites
collect
the
tenth
and
the
Levites
should
offer
up
a
tenth
of
the
tenth
to
the
house
of
our
God
to
the
rooms
of
the
storehouse
39
For
it
is
to
the
storerooms
that
the
Israelites
and
the
sons
of
the
Levites
should
bring
the
contribution
of
the
grain
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
and
that
is
where
the
utensils
of
the
sanctuary
are
as
well
as
the
priests
who
minister
the
gatekeepers
and
the
singers
We
will
not
neglect
the
house
of
our
God
1
Now
the
princes
of
the
people
were
living
in
Jerusalem
but
the
rest
of
the
people
cast
lots
to
bring
one
out
of
every
ten
to
live
in
Jerusalem
the
holy
city
while
the
other
nine
stayed
in
the
other
cities
2
Moreover
the
people
blessed
all
the
men
who
volunteered
to
live
in
Jerusalem
3
And

are

the

and
Eliashib

Eliashib
Joiada
Johanan

Mattaniah
Bakbukiah
Obadiah
Meshullam
Talmon
and
Akkub
were
standing
guard
as

guarding
the
storerooms
by
the
gates
26
These
served
in
the
days
of
Joiakim
the
son
of
Jeshua
the
son
of
Jozadak
and
in
the
days
of
Nehemiah
the
governor
and
Ezra
the
priest
and
copyist
27
At
the
inauguration
of
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
they
sought
the
Levites
and
brought
them
to
Jerusalem
from
all
the
places
they
lived
to
celebrate
the
inauguration
with
rejoicing
with
songs
of
thanksgiving
and
with
cymbals
stringed
instruments
and
harps
28
And
the
sons
of
the
singers
gathered
together
from
the
district
from
all
around
Jerusalem
from
the
settlements
of
the
Netophathites
29
from
Beth-gilgal
and
from
the
fields
of
Geba
and
Azmaveth
for
the
singers
had
built
settlements
for
themselves
all
around
Jerusalem
30
And
the
priests
and
the
Levites
purified
themselves
and
they
purified
the
people
the
gates
and
the
wall
31
Then
I
brought
the
princes
of
Judah
up
on
top
of
the
wall
Further
I
appointed
two
large
thanksgiving
choirs
and
processions
and
the
one
walked
to
the
right
on
the
wall
toward
the
Gate
of
the
Ash
Heaps
32
Hoshaiah
and
half
of
the
princes
of
Judah
walked
behind
them
33
along
with
Azariah
Ezra
Meshullam
34
Judah
Benjamin
Shemaiah
and
Jeremiah
35
With
them
were
some
of
the
sons
of
the
priests
with
the
trumpets
Zechariah
son
of
Jonathan
son
of
Shemaiah
son
of
Mattaniah
son
of
Micaiah
son
of
Zaccur
son
of
Asaph
36
and
his
brothers
Shemaiah
Azarel
Milalai
Gilalai
Maai
Nethanel
Judah
and
Hanani
with
the
musical
instruments
of
David
the
man
of
the
true
God
and
Ezra
the
copyist
went
before
them
37
At
the
Fountain
Gate
they
went
straight
ahead
up
the
Stairway
of
the
City
of
David
by
the
ascent
of
the
wall
above
the
House
of
David
and
on
to
the
Water
Gate
to
the
east
38
The
other
thanksgiving
choir
walked
in
the
opposite
direction
and
I
followed
it
with
half
of
the
people
on
the
wall
up
over
the
Tower
of
the
Ovens
and
on
to
the
Broad
Wall
39
and
up
over
the
Gate
of
Ephraim
and
on
to
the
Gate
of
the
Old
City
and
on
to
the
Fish
Gate
the
Tower
of
Hananel
the
Tower
of
Meah
and
on
to
the
Sheep
Gate
and
they
came
to
a
halt
at
the
Gate
of
the
Guard
40
At
length
the
two
thanksgiving
choirs
stood
before
the
house
of
the
true
God
so
did
I
and
half
of
the
deputy
rulers
with
me
41
and
the
priests
Eliakim
Maaseiah
Miniamin
Micaiah
Elioenai
Zechariah
and
Hananiah
with
the
trumpets
42
and
Maaseiah
Shemaiah
Eleazar
Uzzi
Jehohanan
Malchijah
Elam
and
Ezer
And
the
singers
sang
loudly
under
the
oversight
of
Izrahiah
43
On
that
day
they
offered
great
sacrifices
and
rejoiced
for
the
true
God
made
them
rejoice
with
great
joy
The
women
and
the
children
also
rejoiced
so
that
the
rejoicing
of
Jerusalem
could
be
heard
far
away
44
On
that
day
men
were
appointed
over
the
storehouses
for
the
contributions
the
firstfruits
and
the
tenths
Into
them
they
were
to
gather
from
the
fields
of
the
cities
the
portions
required
by
the
Law
for
the
priests
and
the
Levites
for
there
was
rejoicing
in
Judah
because
of
the
priests
and
the
Levites
who
were
ministering
45
And
they
began
taking
care
of
the
duties
of
their
God
and
the
obligation
of
the
purification
as
did
the
singers
and
the
gatekeepers
according
to
the
instructions
of
David
and
his
son
Solomon
46
For
long
ago
in
the
days
of
David
and
Asaph
there
were
directors
for
the
singers
and
for
the
songs
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
to
God
47
And
during
the
days
of
Zerubbabel
and
during
the
days
of
Nehemiah
all
Israel
gave
portions
to
the
singers
and
the
gatekeepers
according
to
the
daily
need
They
also
set
aside
the
portion
for
the
Levites
and
the
Levites
set
aside
the
portion
for
the
descendants
of
Aaron
1
On
that
day
the
book
of
Moses
was
read
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
and
it
was
found
written
that
no
Ammonite
or
Moabite
should
ever
enter
the
congregation
of
the
true
God
2
for
they
had
not
met
the
Israelites
with
bread
and
water
but
instead
they
had
hired
Balaam
against
them
to
curse
them
However
our
God
had
changed
the
curse
into
a
blessing
3
As
soon
as
they
heard
the
Law
they
began
to
separate
from
Israel
all
those
of
foreign
descent
4
Now
before
this
the
priest
in
charge
of
the
storerooms
of
the
house
of
our
God
was
Eliashib
a
relative
of
Tobiah
5
He
had
made
available
for
him
a
large
storeroom
where
previously
they
used
to
put
the
grain
offering
the
frankincense
and
the
utensils
and
the
tenth
of
the
grain
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
to
which
the
Levites
the
singers
and
the
gatekeepers
are
entitled
along
with
the
contribution
for
the
priests
6
And
during
all
this
time
I
was
not
in
Jerusalem
for
I
went
to
the
king
in
the
32nd
year
of
King
Artaxerxes
of
Babylon
and
sometime
later
I
asked
the
king
for
a
leave
of
absence
7
Then
I
came
to
Jerusalem
and
noticed
the
terrible
thing
that
Eliashib
had
done
in
behalf
of
Tobiah
making
a
storeroom
available
for
him
in
the
courtyard
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
8
This
was
very
displeasing
to
me
so
I
threw
all
of
Tobiahs
household
furniture
out
of
the
storeroom
9
After
that
I
gave
orders
and
they
cleansed
the
storerooms
and
I
put
back
there
the
utensils
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
with
the
grain
offering
and
the
frankincense
10
I
also
found
out
that
the
portions
of
the
Levites
had
not
been
given
them
so
that
the
Levites
and
the
singers
who
did
the
work
had
gone
off
each
to
his
own
field
11
So
I
reprimanded
the
deputy
rulers
and
said
Why
has
the
house
of
the
true
God
been
neglected
Then
I
gathered
them
together
and
assigned
them
back
to
their
posts
12
And
all
Judah
brought
in
the
tenth
of
the
grain
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
to
the
storerooms
13
Then
I
put
Shelemiah
the
priest
Zadok
the
copyist
and
Pedaiah
of
the
Levites
in
charge
of
the
storerooms
and
Hanan
the
son
of
Zaccur
the
son
of
Mattaniah
was
their
assistant
for
these
men
were
considered
reliable
It
was
their
responsibility
to
make
the
distribution
to
their
brothers
14
Do
remember
me
O
my
God
concerning
this
and
do
not
wipe
out
my
acts
of
loyal
love
that
I
have
done
for
the
house
of
my
God
and
its
services
15
In
those
days
I
saw
people
in
Judah
treading
winepresses
on
the
Sabbath
bringing
in
heaps
of
grain
and
loading
them
on
donkeys
and
bringing
wine
grapes
figs
and
every
sort
of
load
into
Jerusalem
on
the
Sabbath
day
So
I
warned
them
against
selling
provisions
on
that
day
16
And
the
Tyrians
who
lived
in
the
city
were
bringing
in
fish
and
all
kinds
of
merchandise
selling
them
to
the
people
of
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem
on
the
Sabbath
17
So
I
reprimanded
the
nobles
of
Judah
and
said
to
them
What
is
this
evil
thing
that
you
are
doing
even
profaning
the
Sabbath
day
18
Was
not
this
what
your
forefathers
did
so
that
our
God
brought
all
this
disaster
on
us
and
also
on
this
city
Now
you
are
adding
to
the
burning
anger
against
Israel
by
profaning
the
Sabbath
19
So
as
soon
as
the
shadows
began
to
fall
on
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
before
the
Sabbath
I
ordered
that
the
doors
be
closed
I
also
said
that
they
should
not
open
them
until
after
the
Sabbath
and
I
stationed
some
of
my
own
attendants
at
the
gates
so
that
no
loads
would
be
brought
in
on
the
Sabbath
day
20
So
the
traders
and
the
sellers
of
all
kinds
of
merchandise
spent
the
night
outside
Jerusalem
once
or
twice
21
Then
I
warned
them
and
said
to
them
Why
are
you
spending
the
night
in
front
of
the
wall
If
you
do
it
again
I
will
use
force
against
you
From
that
time
on
they
did
not
come
on
the
Sabbath
22
And
I
told
the
Levites
that
they
should
regularly
purify
themselves
and
come
and
guard
the
gates
to
keep
the
Sabbath
day
holy
This
also
do
remember
to
my
credit
O
my
God
and
show
me
pity
according
to
your
abundant
loyal
love
23
In
those
days
I
also
saw
Jews
who
had
married
Ashdodite
Ammonite
and
Moabite
women
24
Half
of
their
sons
were
speaking
Ashdodite
and
the
language
of
the
different
peoples
but
none
of
them
knew
how
to
speak
the
language
of
the
Jews
25
So
I
reprimanded
them
and
called
down
a
curse
on
them
and
struck
some
of
the
men
and
pulled
out
their
hair
and
made
them
swear
by
God
You
should
not
give
your
daughters
to
their
sons
and
you
should
not
accept
any
of
their
daughters
for
your
sons
or
yourselves
26
Was
it
not
because
of
these
that
King
Solomon
of
Israel
sinned
Among
the
many
nations
there
was
no
king
like
him
and
he
was
loved
by
his
God
so
that
God
made
him
king
over
all
Israel
But
the
foreign
wives
caused
even
him
to
sin
27
Is
it
not
something
unheard
of
for
you
to
commit
this
great
evil
in
acting
unfaithfully
against
our
God
by
marrying
foreign
women
28
One
of
the
sons
of
Joiada
the
son
of
Eliashib
the
high
priest
had
become
a
son-in-law
of
Sanballat
the
Horonite
So
I
drove
him
away
from
me
29
Do
remember
them
O
my
God
because
they
have
defiled
the
priesthood
and
the
covenant
of
the
priesthood
and
the
Levites
30
And
I
purified
them
from
every
foreign
defilement
and
I
assigned
duties
to
the
priests
and
to
the
Levites
each
to
his
own
service
31
and
arranged
for
the
supply
of
the
wood
at
appointed
times
and
for
the
first
ripe
fruits
Do
remember
me
favorably
O
my
God
1
Now
in
the
days
of
Ahasuerus
that
is
the
Ahasuerus
who
ruled
over
127
provinces
from
India
to
Ethiopia
2
in
those
days
when
King
Ahasuerus
was
sitting
on
his
royal
throne
in
Shushan
the
citadel
3
in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
he
held
a
banquet
for
all
his
princes
and
his
servants
The
army
of
Persia
and
Media
the
nobles
and
the
princes
of
the
provinces
were
before
him
4
and
he
showed
them
the
wealth
of
his
glorious
kingdom
and
the
grandeur
and
the
splendor
of
his
magnificence
for
many
days
180
days
5
And
when
these
days
were
completed
the
king
held
a
banquet
for
seven
days
for
all
the
people
present
in
Shushan
the
citadel
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
in
the
courtyard
of
the
garden
of
the
kings
palace
6
There
were
linen
fine
cotton
and
blue
material
held
fast
in
ropes
of
fine
fabric
purple
wool
in
silver
rings
pillars
of
marble
and
couches
of
gold
and
silver
on
a
pavement
of
porphyry
marble
pearl
and
black
marble
7
Wine
was
served
in
gold
cups
each
cup
was
different
from
the
other
and
the
royal
wine
was
plentiful
according
to
the
means
of
the
king
8
The
drinking
was
according
to
the
rule
that
no
one
was
under
compulsion
for
the
king
had
arranged
with
the
officials
of
his
palace
that
each
should
do
as
he
pleased
9
Queen
Vashti
also
held
a
banquet
for
the
women
at
the
royal
house
of
King
Ahasuerus
10
On
the
seventh
day
when
the
kings
heart
was
in
a
cheerful
mood
because
of
the
wine
he
told
Mehuman
Biztha
Harbona
Bigtha
Abagtha
Zethar
and
Carkas
the
seven
court
officials
who
were
personal
attendants
to
King
Ahasuerus
11
to
bring
before
the
king
Queen
Vashti
wearing
the
royal
headdress
to
show
the
peoples
and
the
princes
her
beauty
for
she
was
very
beautiful
12
But
Queen
Vashti
kept
refusing
to
come
at
the
kings
order
that
was
conveyed
through
the
court
officials
At
this
the
king
became
very
angry
and
his
rage
flared
up
within
him
13
The
king
then
spoke
to
the
wise
men
who
had
insight
with
regard
to
precedents
for
in
this
way
the
kings
matter
came
before
all
those
versed
in
law
and
legal
cases
14
and
those
closest
to
him
were
Carshena
Shethar
Admatha
Tarshish
Meres
Marsena
and
Memucan
seven
princes
of
Persia
and
Media
who
had
access
to
the
king
and
who
occupied
the
highest
positions
in
the
kingdom
15
The
king
asked
According
to
law
what
is
to
be
done
with
Queen
Vashti
because
she
has
not
obeyed
the
order
of
King
Ahasuerus
conveyed
through
the
court
officials
16
To
this
Memucan
said
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
the
princes
It
is
not
against
the
king
alone
that
Queen
Vashti
has
done
wrong
but
against
all
the
princes
and
against
all
the
peoples
in
all
the
provinces
of
King
Ahasuerus
17
For
what
the
queen
did
will
become
known
by
all
the
wives
and
they
will
despise
their
husbands
and
say
King
Ahasuerus
said
to
bring
in
Queen
Vashti
before
him
but
she
refused
to
come
18
This
very
day
the
princesses
of
Persia
and
Media
who
know
about
what
the
queen
did
will
talk
to
all
the
princes
of
the
king
resulting
in
much
contempt
and
indignation
19
If
it
seems
good
to
the
king
let
a
royal
decree
be
issued
from
him
and
let
it
be
written
among
the
laws
of
Persia
and
Media
which
cannot
be
repealed
that
Vashti
may
never
again
come
in
before
King
Ahasuerus
and
let
the
king
confer
her
royal
position
on
a
woman
who
is
better
than
she
is
20
And
when
the
decree
of
the
king
is
heard
in
all
his
vast
realm
all
the
wives
will
give
honor
to
their
husbands
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
21
This
proposal
pleased
the
king
and
the
princes
and
the
king
did
what
Memucan
said
22
So
he
sent
letters
to
all
the
royal
provinces
to
each
province
in
its
own
script
and
to
each
people
in
its
own
language
for
every
husband
to
be
master
in
his
own
house
and
to
speak
in
the
language
of
his
own
people
1
After
these
things
when
the
rage
of
King
Ahasuerus
had
subsided
he
remembered
what
Vashti
had
done
and
what
had
been
decided
against
her
2
Then
the
kings
personal
attendants
said
A
search
should
be
made
for
young
beautiful
virgins
for
the
king
3
And
let
the
king
appoint
commissioners
in
all
the
provinces
of
his
realm
to
bring
together
all
the
beautiful
young
virgins
to
Shushan
the
citadel
to
the
house
of
the
women
Let
them
be
put
in
the
care
of
Hegai
the
kings
eunuch
and
guardian
of
the
women
and
let
them
be
given
beauty
treatments
4
And
the
young
woman
who
is
most
pleasing
to
the
king
will
be
queen
instead
of
Vashti
The
suggestion
was
pleasing
to
the
king
and
that
is
what
he
did
5
There
was
a
certain
Jewish
man
in
Shushan
the
citadel
whose
name
was
Mordecai
son
of
Jair
son
of
Shimei
son
of
Kish
a
Benjaminite
6
who
had
been
taken
into
exile
from
Jerusalem
with
the
people
who
were
deported
with
King
Jeconiah
of
Judah
whom
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
took
into
exile
7
He
was
the
guardian
of
Hadassah
that
is
Esther
the
daughter
of
his
fathers
brother
for
she
had
neither
father
nor
mother
The
young
woman
was
beautifully
formed
and
attractive
in
appearance
and
at
the
death
of
her
father
and
her
mother
Mordecai
took
her
as
his
daughter
8
When
the
kings
word
and
his
law
were
proclaimed
and
when
many
young
women
were
brought
together
at
Shushan
the
citadel
under
the
care
of
Hegai
Esther
was
also
taken
to
the
kings
house
under
the
care
of
Hegai
the
guardian
of
the
women
9
Now
the
young
woman
was
pleasing
to
him
and
won
his
favor
so
he
promptly
arranged
for
her
beauty
treatments
and
her
diet
and
he
assigned
to
her
seven
selected
young
women
from
the
kings
house
He
also
transferred
her
and
her
young
attendants
to
the
best
place
in
the
house
of
the
women
10
Esther
did
not
say
anything
about
her
people
or
her
relatives
for
Mordecai
had
instructed
her
not
to
tell
anyone
11
Day
after
day
Mordecai
would
walk
in
front
of
the
courtyard
of
the
house
of
the
women
to
learn
about
Esthers
welfare
and
about
what
was
happening
to
her
12
Each
young
woman
had
her
turn
to
go
in
to
King
Ahasuerus
after
completing
the
12-month
treatment
that
was
prescribed
for
the
women
for
this
was
the
way
they
had
to
fulfill
their
beauty
treatment—six
months
with
oil
of
myrrh
and
six
months
with
balsam
oil
and
various
ointments
for
beauty
treatment
13
Then
the
young
woman
was
ready
to
go
in
to
the
king
and
whatever
she
asked
for
would
be
given
her
when
she
went
from
the
house
of
the
women
to
the
kings
house
14
In
the
evening
she
would
go
in
and
in
the
morning
she
would
return
to
the
second
house
of
the
women
under
the
care
of
Shaashgaz
the
kings
eunuch
the
guardian
of
the
concubines
She
would
not
go
to
the
king
again
unless
the
king
had
been
especially
pleased
with
her
and
she
was
requested
by
name
15
And
when
the
turn
came
for
Esther
the
daughter
of
Abihail
the
uncle
of
Mordecai
who
had
taken
her
as
his
daughter
to
go
in
to
the
king
she
did
not
request
anything
except
what
Hegai
the
kings
eunuch
the
guardian
of
the
women
recommended
All
the
while
Esther
was
winning
the
favor
of
everyone
who
saw
her
16
Esther
was
taken
to
King
Ahasuerus
at
his
royal
house
in
the
tenth
month
that
is
the
month
of
Tebeth
in
the
seventh
year
of
his
reign
17
And
the
king
came
to
love
Esther
more
than
all
the
other
women
and
she
won
his
favor
and
approval
more
than
any
of
the
other
virgins
So
he
put
the
royal
headdress
on
her
head
and
made
her
queen
instead
of
Vashti
18
And
the
king
held
a
great
banquet
for
all
his
princes
and
his
servants
the
banquet
of
Esther
He
then
proclaimed
an
amnesty
for
the
provinces
and
he
kept
giving
gifts
according
to
the
means
of
the
king
19
Now
when
virgins
were
brought
together
a
second
time
Mordecai
was
sitting
in
the
kings
gate
20
Esther
did
not
say
anything
about
her
relatives
and
her
people
just
as
Mordecai
had
instructed
her
Esther
continued
to
do
what
Mordecai
said
just
as
when
she
was
under
his
care
21
In
those
days
while
Mordecai
was
sitting
in
the
kings
gate
Bigthan
and
Teresh
two
court
officials
of
the
king
doorkeepers
got
angry
and
plotted
to
do
away
with
King
Ahasuerus
22
But
Mordecai
learned
about
it
and
he
immediately
told
Queen
Esther
Esther
then
spoke
to
the
king
in
Mordecais
name
23
So
the
matter
was
investigated
and
eventually
confirmed
and
both
men
were
hanged
on
a
stake
and
this
was
all
recorded
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
in
the
presence
of
the
king
1
After
this
King
Ahasuerus
promoted
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
Agagite
and
exalted
him
by
putting
his
throne
above
all
the
other
princes
who
were
with
him
2
And
all
the
kings
servants
who
were
in
the
kings
gate
would
bow
low
and
prostrate
themselves
to
Haman
for
this
is
what
the
king
had
commanded
respecting
him
But
Mordecai
refused
to
bow
low
or
prostrate
himself
3
So
the
kings
servants
who
were
in
the
kings
gate
said
to
Mordecai
Why
are
you
ignoring
the
kings
commandment
4
Day
after
day
they
would
ask
him
but
he
would
not
listen
to
them
Then
they
told
Haman
to
see
whether
Mordecais
conduct
would
be
tolerated
for
he
had
told
them
that
he
was
a
Jew
5
Now
when
Haman
saw
that
Mordecai
refused
to
bow
low
and
prostrate
himself
to
him
Haman
became
filled
with
rage
6
But
he
despised
the
thought
of
doing
away
with
Mordecai
alone
for
they
had
told
him
about
Mordecais
people
So
Haman
began
seeking
to
annihilate
all
the
Jews
who
were
in
the
entire
realm
of
Ahasuerus
all
of
Mordecais
people
7
In
the
first
month
that
is
the
month
of
Nisan
in
the
12th
year
of
King
Ahasuerus
they
cast
Pur
that
is
the
Lot
before
Haman
to
determine
the
day
and
the
month
and
it
fell
on
the
12th
month
that
is
Adar
8
Haman
then
said
to
King
Ahasuerus
There
is
a
certain
people
scattered
and
dispersed
among
the
peoples
in
all
the
provinces
of
your
realm
whose
laws
are
different
from
those
of
all
other
peoples
and
they
do
not
obey
the
kings
laws
and
it
is
not
in
the
kings
interests
to
let
them
be
9
If
it
pleases
the
king
let
a
decree
be
written
that
they
be
destroyed
I
will
pay
10000
silver
talents
to
the
officials
to
put
into
the
royal
treasury
10
At
that
the
king
removed
his
signet
ring
from
his
own
hand
and
gave
it
to
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
Agagite
who
was
the
enemy
of
the
Jews
11
The
king
said
to
Haman
The
silver
and
the
people
are
given
to
you
to
do
with
them
as
you
see
fit
12
The
kings
secretaries
were
then
called
on
the
13th
day
of
the
first
month
They
put
in
writing
all
of
Hamans
orders
to
the
kings
satraps
the
governors
who
were
over
the
provinces
and
the
princes
of
the
different
peoples
to
each
province
in
its
own
script
and
to
each
people
in
its
own
language
It
was
written
in
the
name
of
King
Ahasuerus
and
sealed
with
the
kings
signet
ring
13
The
letters
were
sent
by
means
of
couriers
to
all
the
kings
provinces
giving
the
order
to
annihilate
to
kill
and
to
destroy
all
the
Jews
young
and
old
alike
children
and
women
on
a
single
day
on
the
13th
day
of
the
12th
month
that
is
the
month
of
Adar
and
to
seize
their
possessions
14
A
copy
of
the
document
was
to
be
issued
as
a
law
in
every
province
and
proclaimed
to
all
the
peoples
so
that
they
would
be
prepared
for
that
day
15
The
couriers
went
out
quickly
by
order
of
the
king
the
law
was
issued
in
Shushan
the
citadel
The
king
and
Haman
then
sat
down
to
drink
but
the
city
of
Shushan
was
in
confusion
1
When
Mordecai
learned
of
everything
that
had
been
done
he
ripped
his
garments
apart
and
put
on
sackcloth
and
ashes
Then
he
went
out
into
the
middle
of
the
city
crying
out
loudly
and
bitterly
2
He
went
only
as
far
as
the
kings
gate
for
no
one
was
to
enter
the
kings
gate
wearing
sackcloth
3
And
in
every
province
where
the
kings
word
and
his
decree
reached
there
was
great
mourning
among
the
Jews
along
with
fasting
and
weeping
and
wailing
Many
were
lying
down
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
4
When
Esthers
female
attendants
and
her
eunuchs
came
in
and
told
her
the
queen
was
deeply
distressed
Then
she
sent
garments
for
Mordecai
to
wear
instead
of
his
sackcloth
but
he
refused
them
5
At
this
Esther
summoned
Hathach
one
of
the
kings
eunuchs
whom
he
had
appointed
to
serve
her
and
she
ordered
him
to
find
out
from
Mordecai
what
this
meant
and
what
was
happening
6
So
Hathach
went
out
to
Mordecai
in
the
public
square
of
the
city
in
front
of
the
kings
gate
7
Mordecai
told
him
about
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
and
the
exact
amount
of
money
that
Haman
had
promised
to
pay
to
the
kings
treasury
for
the
Jews
to
be
destroyed
8
He
also
gave
him
a
copy
of
the
written
decree
that
had
been
issued
in
Shushan
for
their
annihilation
He
was
to
show
it
to
Esther
and
explain
it
to
her
and
instruct
her
to
go
in
to
the
king
to
beg
for
his
favor
and
to
plead
directly
with
him
in
behalf
of
her
people
9
Hathach
came
back
and
told
Esther
what
Mordecai
had
said
10
Esther
replied
to
Hathach
with
instructions
to
tell
Mordecai
11
All
the
kings
servants
and
the
people
of
the
kings
provinces
are
aware
that
if
any
man
or
woman
goes
into
the
kings
inner
courtyard
without
being
summoned
there
is
only
one
law
that
applies
He
is
to
be
put
to
death
he
may
live
only
if
the
king
holds
out
to
him
the
golden
scepter
And
I
have
not
been
summoned
to
the
king
now
for
30
days
12
When
Mordecai
was
told
what
Esther
had
said
13
he
replied
to
Esther
Do
not
imagine
that
because
you
are
in
the
kings
household
you
are
any
more
likely
to
escape
than
all
the
other
Jews
14
For
if
you
remain
silent
at
this
time
relief
and
deliverance
will
come
to
the
Jews
from
another
source
but
you
and
your
fathers
house
will
perish
And
who
knows
whether
it
is
for
a
time
like
this
that
you
have
attained
to
your
royal
status
15
Then
Esther
replied
to
Mordecai
16
Go
gather
all
the
Jews
who
are
found
in
Shushan
and
fast
in
my
behalf
Do
not
eat
or
drink
for
three
days
night
and
day
I
along
with
my
female
attendants
will
also
fast
I
will
go
in
to
the
king
which
is
against
the
law
and
if
I
am
to
perish
I
will
perish
17
So
Mordecai
went
his
way
and
did
all
that
Esther
had
instructed
him
to
do
1
On
the
third
day
Esther
put
on
her
royal
robes
and
stood
in
the
inner
courtyard
of
the
kings
house
opposite
the
kings
house
while
the
king
was
sitting
on
his
royal
throne
in
the
royal
house
opposite
the
entrance
2
As
soon
as
the
king
saw
Queen
Esther
standing
in
the
courtyard
she
gained
his
favor
and
the
king
held
out
to
Esther
the
golden
scepter
that
was
in
his
hand
Esther
then
approached
and
touched
the
top
of
the
scepter
3
The
king
asked
her
What
is
the
matter
Queen
Esther
What
is
your
request
Even
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
it
will
be
granted
you
4
Esther
replied
If
it
pleases
the
king
let
the
king
along
with
Haman
come
today
to
the
banquet
that
I
have
prepared
for
him
5
So
the
king
said
to
his
men
Tell
Haman
to
come
quickly
as
Esther
requests
So
the
king
and
Haman
went
to
the
banquet
that
Esther
had
prepared
6
During
the
banquet
of
wine
the
king
said
to
Esther
What
is
your
petition
It
will
be
granted
you
And
what
is
your
request
Even
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
it
will
be
done
7
Esther
answered
My
petition
and
my
request
is
8
If
I
have
found
favor
with
the
king
and
if
it
pleases
the
king
to
grant
my
petition
and
to
act
on
my
request
let
the
king
and
Haman
come
to
the
banquet
that
I
will
hold
for
them
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
I
will
do
as
the
king
says
9
On
that
day
Haman
went
out
joyful
and
with
a
cheerful
heart
But
when
Haman
saw
Mordecai
in
the
kings
gate
and
noticed
that
he
did
not
rise
and
tremble
in
his
presence
Haman
was
filled
with
rage
against
Mordecai
10
However
Haman
restrained
himself
and
went
to
his
house
Then
he
sent
for
his
friends
and
Zeresh
his
wife
11
Haman
boasted
about
his
glorious
wealth
his
many
sons
and
how
the
king
had
promoted
him
and
had
exalted
him
over
the
princes
and
the
servants
of
the
king
12
Haman
added
What
is
more
Queen
Esther
invited
no
one
else
but
me
to
accompany
the
king
to
the
banquet
she
prepared
I
am
also
invited
tomorrow
to
be
with
her
and
the
king
13
But
all
of
this
fails
to
satisfy
me
as
long
as
I
see
Mordecai
the
Jew
sitting
in
the
kings
gate
14
So
Zeresh
his
wife
and
all
his
friends
said
to
him
Have
a
stake
put
up
50
cubits
high
And
in
the
morning
tell
the
king
that
Mordecai
should
be
hanged
on
it
Then
go
with
the
king
to
enjoy
yourself
at
the
banquet
This
suggestion
seemed
good
to
Haman
so
he
had
the
stake
put
up
1
That
night
the
king
could
not
sleep
So
he
said
to
bring
the
book
of
the
historical
records
of
the
times
and
it
was
read
to
the
king
2
There
it
was
found
written
what
Mordecai
had
reported
concerning
Bigthana
and
Teresh
two
court
officials
of
the
king
doorkeepers
who
had
plotted
to
do
away
with
King
Ahasuerus
3
The
king
asked
What
honor
and
recognition
has
been
given
to
Mordecai
for
this
To
this
the
kings
personal
attendants
said
Nothing
has
been
done
for
him
4
Later
the
king
said
Who
is
in
the
courtyard
Now
Haman
had
come
into
the
outer
courtyard
of
the
kings
house
to
speak
to
the
king
about
having
Mordecai
hanged
on
the
stake
that
he
had
prepared
for
him
5
The
kings
attendants
said
to
him
It
is
Haman
standing
in
the
courtyard
So
the
king
said
Have
him
come
in
6
When
Haman
came
in
the
king
said
to
him
What
should
be
done
for
the
man
whom
the
king
wishes
to
honor
Haman
said
in
his
heart
Whom
would
the
king
wish
to
honor
more
than
me
7
So
Haman
said
to
the
king
For
the
man
whom
the
king
wishes
to
honor
8
let
them
bring
royal
attire
that
the
king
wears
and
a
horse
on
which
the
king
rides
with
the
royal
headdress
on
its
head
9
Then
let
the
attire
and
the
horse
be
put
into
the
charge
of
one
of
the
kings
noble
princes
and
they
should
clothe
the
man
whom
the
king
wishes
to
honor
and
have
him
ride
on
the
horse
in
the
public
square
of
the
city
They
should
call
out
before
him
This
is
what
is
done
for
the
man
whom
the
king
wishes
to
honor
10
At
once
the
king
said
to
Haman
Quick
Take
the
attire
and
the
horse
and
do
what
you
just
said
for
Mordecai
the
Jew
who
is
sitting
in
the
kings
gate
Do
not
leave
out
anything
that
you
have
said
11
So
Haman
took
the
attire
and
the
horse
and
he
clothed
Mordecai
and
made
him
ride
in
the
public
square
of
the
city
and
called
out
before
him
This
is
what
is
done
for
the
man
whom
the
king
wishes
to
honor
12
Afterward
Mordecai
returned
to
the
kings
gate
but
Haman
hurried
to
his
house
mourning
with
his
head
covered
13
When
Haman
related
to
his
wife
Zeresh
and
to
all
his
friends
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
his
wise
men
and
his
wife
Zeresh
said
to
him
If
Mordecai
before
whom
you
have
started
to
fall
is
of
Jewish
descent
you
will
not
prevail
against
him
you
will
surely
fall
before
him
14
While
they
were
still
speaking
with
him
the
kings
court
officials
arrived
and
quickly
took
Haman
to
the
banquet
that
Esther
had
made
1
So
the
king
and
Haman
came
in
to
Queen
Esthers
banquet
2
The
king
said
to
Esther
again
on
the
second
day
during
the
banquet
of
wine
What
is
your
petition
Queen
Esther
It
will
be
granted
you
And
what
is
your
request
Even
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
it
will
be
done
3
Queen
Esther
answered
If
I
have
found
favor
with
you
O
king
and
if
it
pleases
the
king
let
my
life
be
granted
as
my
petition
and
my
people
as
my
request
4
For
we
have
been
sold
I
and
my
people
to
be
annihilated
killed
and
destroyed
If
we
had
simply
been
sold
as
male
and
female
slaves
I
would
have
kept
silent
But
the
distress
is
not
proper
for
it
will
be
damaging
to
the
king
5
King
Ahasuerus
then
said
to
Queen
Esther
Who
is
this
and
where
is
the
man
who
has
dared
to
do
such
a
thing
6
Esther
said
The
adversary
and
enemy
is
this
evil
Haman
Haman
became
terrified
because
of
the
king
and
the
queen
7
The
king
rose
up
in
a
rage
from
the
banquet
of
wine
and
went
into
the
palace
garden
but
Haman
stood
up
to
plead
with
Queen
Esther
for
his
life
for
he
realized
that
the
king
was
determined
to
punish
him
8
The
king
returned
from
the
palace
garden
to
the
house
of
the
wine
banquet
and
saw
that
Haman
had
thrown
himself
on
the
couch
where
Esther
was
The
king
exclaimed
Is
he
also
going
to
rape
the
queen
in
my
own
house
As
soon
as
these
words
left
the
kings
mouth
they
covered
Hamans
face
9
Harbona
one
of
the
kings
court
officials
now
said
Haman
also
prepared
a
stake
for
Mordecai
whose
report
saved
the
king
It
is
standing
at
Hamans
house
50
cubits
high
At
that
the
king
said
Hang
him
on
it
10
So
they
hanged
Haman
on
the
stake
that
he
had
prepared
for
Mordecai
and
the
kings
rage
subsided
1
On
that
day
King
Ahasuerus
gave
the
house
of
Haman
the
enemy
of
the
Jews
to
Queen
Esther
and
Mordecai
came
in
before
the
king
because
Esther
had
revealed
how
he
was
related
to
her
2
Then
the
king
removed
his
signet
ring
that
he
had
taken
away
from
Haman
and
gave
it
to
Mordecai
And
Esther
put
Mordecai
in
charge
of
the
house
of
Haman
3
Moreover
Esther
spoke
again
to
the
king
She
fell
down
at
his
feet
and
wept
and
pleaded
with
him
to
undo
the
harm
done
by
Haman
the
Agagite
and
his
scheme
against
the
Jews
4
The
king
held
the
golden
scepter
out
to
Esther
at
which
Esther
rose
and
stood
before
the
king
5
She
said
If
it
pleases
the
king
and
if
I
have
his
favor
and
if
it
seems
proper
to
the
king
and
I
am
pleasing
in
his
eyes
let
an
order
be
written
to
annul
the
documents
of
that
schemer
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
Agagite
which
he
wrote
to
destroy
the
Jews
in
all
the
kings
provinces
6
For
how
can
I
bear
to
look
upon
the
disaster
that
will
come
upon
my
people
and
how
can
I
bear
to
see
the
destruction
of
my
relatives
7
So
King
Ahasuerus
said
to
Queen
Esther
and
to
Mordecai
the
Jew
Look
I
have
given
the
house
of
Haman
to
Esther
and
have
had
him
hanged
on
the
stake
because
of
his
plot
to
attack
the
Jews
8
You
may
now
write
in
the
kings
name
whatever
you
see
fit
in
behalf
of
the
Jews
and
seal
it
with
the
kings
signet
ring
for
a
decree
that
is
written
in
the
kings
name
and
sealed
with
the
kings
signet
ring
cannot
be
revoked
9
So
the
secretaries
of
the
king
were
summoned
at
that
time
in
the
third
month
that
is
the
month
of
Sivan
on
the
23rd
day
and
they
wrote
all
that
Mordecai
commanded
to
the
Jews
as
well
as
to
the
satraps
the
governors
and
the
princes
of
the
provinces
from
India
to
Ethiopia
127
provinces
to
each
province
in
its
own
script
and
to
each
people
in
its
own
language
and
to
the
Jews
in
their
own
script
and
language
10
He
wrote
it
in
the
name
of
King
Ahasuerus
and
sealed
it
with
the
kings
signet
ring
and
sent
the
written
documents
by
the
hand
of
couriers
on
horses
they
rode
on
swift
post-horses
bred
for
royal
service
11
In
these
documents
the
king
granted
permission
to
the
Jews
in
all
the
different
cities
to
gather
together
and
defend
their
lives
and
to
annihilate
kill
and
destroy
any
forces
of
any
people
or
province
that
might
attack
them
including
women
and
children
and
to
seize
their
possessions
12
This
was
to
occur
on
the
same
day
in
all
the
provinces
of
King
Ahasuerus
on
the
13th
day
of
the
12th
month
that
is
the
month
of
Adar
13
The
text
of
the
document
was
to
be
issued
as
law
throughout
all
the
provinces
It
was
to
be
proclaimed
to
all
the
peoples
so
that
the
Jews
would
be
ready
on
that
day
to
take
vengeance
on
their
enemies
14
The
couriers
riding
the
post-horses
used
in
the
royal
service
went
out
urgently
and
speedily
at
the
kings
order
The
law
was
also
issued
in
Shushan
the
citadel
15
Now
Mordecai
left
the
kings
presence
in
royal
apparel
of
blue
and
white
wearing
a
great
golden
crown
and
a
fine-fabric
cloak
of
purple
wool
And
the
city
of
Shushan
shouted
for
joy
16
For
the
Jews
there
was
relief
and
rejoicing
and
exultation
and
honor
17
And
in
all
the
provinces
and
all
the
cities
wherever
the
decree
of
the
king
and
his
law
reached
the
Jews
were
rejoicing
and
exulting
holding
banquets
and
celebrations
Many
of
the
peoples
of
the
land
were
declaring
themselves
Jews
for
the
dread
of
the
Jews
had
fallen
upon
them
1
On
the
13th
day
of
the
12th
month
that
is
the
month
of
Adar
when
the
kings
word
and
his
law
were
to
be
carried
out
on
the
day
when
the
enemies
of
the
Jews
hoped
to
overpower
them
the
opposite
happened
and
the
Jews
defeated
those
who
hated
them
2
The
Jews
gathered
together
in
their
cities
in
all
the
provinces
of
King
Ahasuerus
to
lay
hands
on
those
seeking
to
harm
them
and
not
a
man
could
stand
against
them
for
the
dread
of
them
had
fallen
upon
all
the
peoples
3
And
all
the
princes
of
the
provinces
the
satraps
the
governors
and
those
handling
the
business
of
the
king
were
supporting
the
Jews
for
they
were
in
fear
of
Mordecai
4
Mordecai
had
become
powerful
in
the
kings
house
and
his
fame
was
spreading
throughout
all
the
provinces
because
Mordecai
was
steadily
growing
more
powerful
5
The
Jews
struck
down
all
their
enemies
with
the
sword
killing
and
destroying
them
they
did
whatever
they
wanted
to
those
hating
them
6
In
Shushan
the
citadel
the
Jews
killed
and
destroyed
500
men
7
Also
they
killed
Parshandatha
Dalphon
Aspatha
8
Poratha
Adalia
Aridatha
9
Parmashta
Arisai
Aridai
and
Vaizatha
10
the
ten
sons
of
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
enemy
of
the
Jews
But
after
they
killed
them
they
did
not
seize
any
plunder
11
On
that
day
the
number
of
those
killed
in
Shushan
the
citadel
was
reported
to
the
king
12
The
king
said
to
Queen
Esther
In
Shushan
the
citadel
the
Jews
have
killed
and
destroyed
500
men
and
the
ten
sons
of
Haman
What
then
have
they
done
in
the
rest
of
the
kings
provinces
What
is
your
petition
now
It
will
be
granted
you
And
what
is
your
further
request
It
will
be
done
13
Esther
replied
If
it
pleases
the
king
let
the
Jews
who
are
in
Shushan
be
permitted
to
act
tomorrow
also
according
to
todays
law
and
let
the
ten
sons
of
Haman
be
hanged
on
the
stake
14
So
the
king
gave
orders
for
that
to
be
done
A
law
was
issued
in
Shushan
and
the
ten
sons
of
Haman
were
hanged
15
The
Jews
in
Shushan
gathered
together
again
on
the
14th
day
of
the
month
of
Adar
and
killed
300
men
in
Shushan
but
they
did
not
seize
any
plunder
16
The
rest
of
the
Jews
in
the
provinces
of
the
king
also
gathered
together
and
defended
their
lives
They
got
rid
of
their
enemies
killing
75000
of
those
who
hated
them
but
they
did
not
seize
any
plunder
17
That
was
on
the
13th
day
of
the
month
of
Adar
and
they
rested
on
the
14th
day
and
made
it
a
day
of
feasting
and
of
rejoicing
18
The
Jews
in
Shushan
gathered
together
on
the
13th
day
and
on
the
14th
day
and
they
rested
on
the
15th
day
and
made
it
a
day
of
feasting
and
rejoicing
19
That
is
why
the
rural
Jews
inhabiting
the
cities
of
the
outlying
districts
made
the
14th
day
of
the
month
of
Adar
a
day
of
rejoicing
and
feasting
a
day
of
celebration
and
a
time
to
send
portions
of
food
to
one
another
20
Mordecai
recorded
these
events
and
sent
official
letters
to
all
the
Jews
in
all
the
provinces
of
King
Ahasuerus
both
near
and
far
21
He
instructed
them
to
observe
the
14th
day
of
the
month
of
Adar
as
well
as
the
15th
day
each
and
every
year
22
because
on
those
days
the
Jews
rested
from
their
enemies
and
in
that
month
their
grief
was
changed
to
rejoicing
and
their
mourning
to
a
day
of
celebration
They
were
to
observe
them
as
days
of
feasting
and
rejoicing
and
as
a
time
to
send
portions
of
food
to
one
another
and
gifts
to
the
poor
23
And
the
Jews
agreed
to
continue
the
celebration
that
they
had
started
and
to
do
what
Mordecai
wrote
to
them
24
For
Haman
the
son
of
Hammedatha
the
Agagite
the
enemy
of
all
the
Jews
had
schemed
against
the
Jews
to
destroy
them
and
he
had
cast
Pur
that
is
the
Lot
to
throw
them
into
a
panic
and
to
destroy
them
25
But
when
Esther
came
in
before
the
king
he
gave
orders
in
writing
Let
his
evil
scheme
against
the
Jews
come
back
on
his
own
head
and
they
hanged
him
and
his
sons
on
the
stake
26
That
is
why
they
called
these
days
Purim
after
the
name
of
the
Pur
Therefore
because
of
all
that
was
written
in
this
letter
and
what
they
saw
concerning
this
matter
and
what
had
come
upon
them
27
the
Jews
obligated
themselves
and
their
descendants
and
all
those
joining
them
to
celebrate
these
two
days
without
fail
and
to
carry
out
what
was
written
concerning
them
at
the
appointed
time
each
and
every
year
28
These
days
were
to
be
remembered
and
observed
in
every
generation
by
each
family
each
province
and
each
city
and
these
days
of
Purim
should
not
cease
among
the
Jews
and
their
commemoration
should
not
come
to
an
end
among
their
descendants
29
Then
Queen
Esther
the
daughter
of
Abihail
and
Mordecai
the
Jew
wrote
with
full
authority
to
confirm
a
second
letter
about
Purim
30
He
sent
official
letters
to
all
the
Jews
in
the
127
provinces
the
realm
of
Ahasuerus
in
words
of
peace
and
truth
31
to
confirm
the
observance
of
the
days
of
Purim
at
their
appointed
times
just
as
Mordecai
the
Jew
and
Queen
Esther
had
instructed
them
to
do
and
just
as
they
had
obligated
themselves
and
their
descendants
to
carry
out
including
the
fasting
and
supplication
32
And
the
command
of
Esther
confirmed
these
matters
concerning
Purim
and
it
was
recorded
in
a
book
1
King
Ahasuerus
imposed
forced
labor
on
the
land
and
the
islands
of
the
sea
2
And
all
his
powerful
and
mighty
accomplishments
as
well
as
the
detailed
account
of
Mordecais
greatness
to
which
the
king
exalted
him
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
history
of
the
times
of
the
kings
of
Media
and
Persia
3
For
Mordecai
the
Jew
was
second
only
to
King
Ahasuerus
He
was
great
among
the
Jews
and
respected
by
the
multitude
of
his
brothers
working
for
the
good
of
his
people
and
advocating
the
welfare
of
all
their
descendants
1
There
was
a
man
in
the
land
of
Uz
whose
name
was
Job
He
was
an
upright
man
of
integrity
he
feared
God
and
shunned
what
was
bad
2
Seven
sons
and
three
daughters
were
born
to
him
3
His
livestock
amounted
to
7000
sheep
3000
camels
1000
cattle
and
500
donkeys
along
with
a
very
large
number
of
servants
so
that
he
became
the
greatest
of
all
the
people
of
the
East
4
Each
of
his
sons
would
hold
a
banquet
at
his
house
on
his
own
set
day
They
would
invite
their
three
sisters
to
eat
and
drink
with
them
5
After
a
series
of
banquet
days
was
complete
Job
would
send
for
them
in
order
to
sanctify
them
Then
he
would
get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
offer
up
burnt
sacrifices
for
each
of
them
For
Job
said
Maybe
my
sons
have
sinned
and
have
cursed
God
in
their
heart
That
is
what
Job
would
always
do
6
Now
the
day
came
when
the
sons
of
the
true
God
entered
to
take
their
station
before
Jehovah
and
Satan
also
entered
among
them
7
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Satan
Where
have
you
come
from
Satan
answered
Jehovah
From
roving
about
on
the
earth
and
from
walking
about
in
it
8
And
Jehovah
said
to
Satan
Have
you
taken
note
of
my
servant
Job
There
is
no
one
like
him
on
the
earth
He
is
an
upright
man
of
integrity
fearing
God
and
shunning
what
is
bad
9
At
that
Satan
answered
Jehovah
Is
it
for
nothing
that
Job
has
feared
God
10
Have
you
not
put
up
a
protective
hedge
around
him
and
his
house
and
everything
he
has
You
have
blessed
the
work
of
his
hands
and
his
livestock
has
spread
out
in
the
land
11
But
for
a
change
stretch
out
your
hand
and
strike
everything
he
has
and
he
will
surely
curse
you
to
your
very
face
12
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Satan
Look
Everything
that
he
has
is
in
your
hand
Only
do
not
lay
your
hand
on
the
man
himself
So
Satan
went
out
from
the
presence
of
Jehovah
13
Now
on
the
day
when
his
sons
and
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
in
their
oldest
brothers
house
14
a
messenger
came
to
Job
and
said
The
cattle
were
plowing
and
the
donkeys
were
grazing
beside
them
15
when
the
Sabeans
attacked
and
took
them
and
they
killed
the
servants
with
the
sword
I
am
the
only
one
who
escaped
to
tell
you
16
While
he
was
still
speaking
another
one
came
and
said
Fire
from
God
fell
from
the
heavens
and
blazed
among
the
sheep
and
the
servants
and
consumed
them
I
am
the
only
one
who
escaped
to
tell
you
17
While
he
was
still
speaking
another
one
came
and
said
The
Chaldeans
formed
three
bands
and
made
a
raid
on
the
camels
and
took
them
and
they
killed
the
servants
with
the
sword
I
am
the
only
one
who
escaped
to
tell
you
18
While
he
was
still
speaking
yet
another
one
came
and
said
Your
sons
and
your
daughters
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
in
their
oldest
brothers
house
19
Suddenly
a
great
wind
came
from
the
wilderness
and
it
struck
the
four
corners
of
the
house
so
that
it
fell
on
the
young
people
and
they
were
killed
I
am
the
only
one
who
escaped
to
tell
you
20
At
that
Job
got
up
and
ripped
apart
his
garment
and
cut
the
hair
off
his
head
then
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
bowed
down
21
and
said
Naked
I
came
out
of
my
mothers
womb
And
naked
I
will
return
Jehovah
has
given
and
Jehovah
has
taken
away
Let
the
name
of
Jehovah
continue
to
be
praised
22
In
all
of
this
Job
did
not
sin
or
accuse
God
of
doing
anything
wrong
1
Afterward
the
day
came
when
the
sons
of
the
true
God
entered
to
take
their
station
before
Jehovah
and
Satan
also
entered
among
them
to
take
his
station
before
Jehovah
2
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Satan
Where
have
you
come
from
Satan
answered
Jehovah
From
roving
about
on
the
earth
and
from
walking
about
in
it
3
And
Jehovah
said
to
Satan
Have
you
taken
note
of
my
servant
Job
There
is
no
one
like
him
on
the
earth
He
is
an
upright
man
of
integrity
fearing
God
and
shunning
what
is
bad
He
is
still
holding
firmly
to
his
integrity
even
though
you
try
to
incite
me
against
him
to
destroy
him
for
no
reason
4
But
Satan
answered
Jehovah
Skin
for
skin
A
man
will
give
everything
that
he
has
for
his
life
5
But
for
a
change
stretch
out
your
hand
and
strike
his
bone
and
flesh
and
he
will
surely
curse
you
to
your
very
face
6
Then
Jehovah
said
to
Satan
Look
He
is
in
your
hand
Only
do
not
take
his
life
7
So
Satan
went
out
from
the
presence
of
Jehovah
and
struck
Job
with
painful
boils
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
to
the
crown
of
his
head
8
And
Job
took
a
piece
of
broken
pottery
to
scrape
himself
and
he
was
sitting
among
the
ashes
9
Finally
his
wife
said
to
him
Are
you
still
holding
firmly
to
your
integrity
Curse
God
and
die
10
But
he
said
to
her
You
are
talking
like
one
of
the
senseless
women
Should
we
accept
only
what
is
good
from
the
true
God
and
not
accept
also
what
is
bad
In
all
of
this
Job
did
not
sin
with
his
lips
11
Three
companions
of
Job
heard
about
all
the
calamities
that
had
come
upon
him
and
each
came
from
his
own
place—Eliphaz
the
Temanite
Bildad
the
Shuhite
and
Zophar
the
Naamathite
So
they
agreed
to
meet
together
to
go
and
sympathize
with
Job
and
comfort
him
12
When
they
saw
him
from
a
distance
they
did
not
recognize
him
They
began
to
weep
loudly
and
to
rip
their
garments
apart
and
they
threw
dust
into
the
air
and
onto
their
heads
13
Then
they
sat
on
the
ground
with
him
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
No
one
said
a
word
to
him
for
they
saw
that
his
pain
was
very
great
1
It
was
after
this
that
Job
began
to
speak
and
to
curse
the
day
of
his
birth
2
Job
said

3
Let
the
day
perish
on
which
I
was
born
Also
the
night
when
someone
said
A
man
has
been
conceived

4
Let
that
day
be
darkness
Let
God
above
show
no
concern
for
it
Let
no
light
shine
upon
it

5
Let
the
deepest
darkness
reclaim
it
Let
a
rain
cloud
settle
over
it
Let
whatever
darkens
the
day
terrify
it

6
That
night—let
the
gloom
seize
it
Let
it
not
rejoice
among
the
days
of
a
year
And
let
it
not
enter
among
the
number
of
the
months

7
Indeed
Let
that
night
become
barren
Let
no
joyful
cry
be
heard
in
it

8
Let
those
who
curse
the
day
put
a
curse
on
it
Those
who
are
able
to
awaken
Leviathan

9
Let
the
stars
of
its
twilight
grow
dark
Let
it
wait
in
vain
for
daylight
And
let
it
not
see
the
rays
of
dawn
10
For
it
did
not
close
the
doors
of
my
mothers
womb
Nor
did
it
hide
trouble
from
my
eyes
11
Why
did
I
not
die
at
birth
Why
did
I
not
perish
when
I
came
from
the
womb
12
Why
were
there
knees
to
receive
meAnd
breasts
to
nurse
me
13
For
now
I
would
be
lying
down
undisturbed
I
would
be
sleeping
and
at
rest14
With
kings
of
the
earth
and
their
advisers
Who
built
for
themselves
places
that
are
now
in
ruins
15
Or
with
princes
who
possessed
gold
Whose
houses
were
filled
with
silver
16
Or
why
was
I
not
like
a
hidden
miscarriage
Like
children
who
have
never
seen
the
light
17
There
even
the
wicked
have
ceased
from
agitation
There
the
weary
are
at
rest
18
There
the
prisoners
are
at
ease
together
They
do
not
hear
the
voice
of
the
one
forcing
them
to
work
19
Small
and
great
are
the
same
there
And
the
slave
is
set
free
from
his
master
20
Why
does
he
give
light
to
one
who
is
sufferingAnd
life
to
those
in
bitter
distress
21
Why
do
they
long
for
death
but
it
does
not
come
They
dig
for
it
more
than
for
hidden
treasures
22
Those
who
are
rejoicing
greatly
Who
are
happy
when
they
find
the
grave
23
Why
does
he
give
light
to
a
man
who
has
lost
his
way
Whom
God
has
hedged
in
24
For
in
place
of
my
food
comes
my
sighing
And
my
groaning
pours
out
like
water
25
For
what
I
have
dreaded
has
come
upon
me
And
what
I
have
feared
has
befallen
me
26
I
have
had
no
peace
no
quiet
no
rest
But
trouble
keeps
coming
1
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
then
said
in
reply

2
If
someone
tries
to
speak
to
you
will
you
become
impatient
For
who
can
hold
back
from
speaking

3
True
you
have
corrected
many
And
you
used
to
strengthen
the
weak
hands

4
Your
words
would
raise
up
anyone
stumbling
And
you
would
strengthen
those
whose
knees
were
buckling

5
But
now
it
has
happened
to
you
and
you
are
overwhelmed
It
touches
you
and
you
are
dismayed

6
Does
your
reverence
for
God
not
give
you
confidence
Does
your
way
of
integrity
not
give
you
hope

7
Remember
please
What
innocent
person
has
ever
perished
When
have
the
upright
ever
been
destroyed

8
What
I
have
seen
is
that
those
who
plow
what
is
harmfulAnd
those
who
sow
trouble
will
reap
the
same

9
By
the
breath
of
God
they
perish
And
through
a
blast
of
his
anger
they
come
to
an
end
10
The
lion
roars
and
a
young
lion
growls
But
even
the
teeth
of
strong
lions
are
broken
11
A
lion
perishes
for
lack
of
prey
And
the
cubs
of
a
lion
are
scattered
12
Now
a
word
was
brought
to
me
in
secret
And
a
whisper
of
it
reached
my
ear
13
In
troubling
thoughts
during
visions
of
the
night
When
deep
sleep
falls
upon
men
14
A
terrible
trembling
came
upon
me
Filling
all
my
bones
with
dread
15
A
spirit
passed
over
my
face
The
hair
of
my
flesh
bristled
16
It
then
stood
still
But
I
did
not
recognize
its
appearance
A
form
was
in
front
of
my
eyes
There
was
a
calm
and
then
I
heard
a
voice
17
Can
a
mortal
man
be
more
righteous
than
God
Can
a
man
be
cleaner
than
his
own
Maker
18
Look
He
has
no
faith
in
his
servants
And
he
finds
fault
with
his
angels
19
How
much
more
so
with
those
dwelling
in
houses
of
clay
Whose
foundation
is
in
the
dust
Who
are
crushed
as
easily
as
a
moth
20
They
are
completely
crushed
from
morning
to
evening
They
perish
forever
and
no
one
takes
notice
21
Are
they
not
like
a
tent
whose
cord
is
pulled
out
They
die
without
wisdom
1
Call
please
Is
there
anyone
answering
you
To
which
of
the
holy
ones
will
you
turn

2
For
resentment
will
kill
the
foolish
one
And
envy
will
put
the
simpleminded
to
death

3
I
have
seen
the
foolish
one
taking
root
But
suddenly
his
dwelling
place
is
cursed

4
His
sons
are
far
from
safety
And
they
are
crushed
at
the
city
gate
with
no
one
to
save
them

5
The
hungry
one
eats
what
he
harvests
Taking
it
even
from
among
the
thorns
And
their
possessions
are
ensnared

6
For
harmful
things
do
not
sprout
from
the
dust
And
trouble
does
not
spring
from
the
ground

7
For
man
is
born
for
trouble
As
surely
as
sparks
fly
upward

8
But
I
would
appeal
to
God
And
to
God
I
would
submit
my
case
9
To
the
One
doing
great
and
unsearchable
things
Wonderful
things
without
number
10
He
gives
rain
to
the
earthAnd
sends
waters
upon
the
fields
11
He
raises
the
lowly
up
high
And
he
raises
up
the
dejected
one
to
salvation
12
He
frustrates
the
schemes
of
the
crafty
So
that
the
work
of
their
hands
does
not
succeed
13
He
catches
the
wise
in
their
own
cunning
So
that
the
plans
of
the
shrewd
are
thwarted
14
They
meet
with
darkness
during
the
day
And
they
grope
about
at
midday
as
if
it
were
night
15
He
saves
from
the
sword
of
their
mouth
Saving
the
poor
from
the
hand
of
the
strong
16
So
that
there
is
hope
for
the
lowly
But
the
mouth
of
unrighteousness
is
shut
17
Look
Happy
is
the
man
whom
God
reproves
So
do
not
reject
the
discipline
of
the
Almighty
18
For
he
causes
pain
but
binds
up
the
wound
He
breaks
apart
but
heals
with
his
own
hands
19
He
will
save
you
from
six
calamities
Even
the
seventh
will
not
harm
you
20
During
famine
he
will
redeem
you
from
death
And
from
the
power
of
a
sword
during
war
21
You
will
be
protected
from
the
lash
of
the
tongue
And
you
will
not
fear
devastation
when
it
comes
22
You
will
laugh
at
destruction
and
hunger
And
you
will
not
fear
the
wild
beasts
of
the
earth
23
For
the
stones
of
the
field
will
not
harm
you
And
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
will
be
at
peace
with
you
24
You
will
know
that
your
tent
is
secure
And
nothing
will
be
missing
when
you
inspect
your
pasture
25
You
will
enjoy
many
children
And
your
descendants
will
be
as
plentiful
as
the
vegetation
of
the
earth
26
You
will
still
be
strong
when
you
go
to
the
grave
Like
sheaves
of
grain
gathered
in
their
season
27
Look
We
have
investigated
this
and
it
is
so
Listen
and
accept
it
1
Job
then
said
in
reply

2
If
only
my
anguish
could
be
fully
weighedAnd
put
on
scales
together
with
my
calamity

3
For
now
it
is
heavier
than
the
sands
of
the
seas
That
is
why
my
words
have
been
wild
talk

4
For
the
arrows
of
the
Almighty
have
pierced
me
And
my
spirit
is
drinking
their
venom
The
terrors
from
God
are
lined
up
against
me

5
Will
a
wild
donkey
cry
out
when
it
has
grass
Or
will
a
bull
bellow
when
it
has
fodder

6
Is
tasteless
food
eaten
without
salt
Or
is
there
flavor
in
the
juice
of
a
mallow

7
I
have
refused
to
touch
such
things
They
are
like
contamination
in
my
food

8
O
that
my
request
would
be
realizedAnd
that
God
would
grant
my
desire

9
That
God
would
be
willing
to
crush
me
And
that
he
would
reach
out
his
hand
and
do
away
with
me
10
For
even
that
would
bring
me
comfort
I
would
leap
for
joy
despite
the
unrelenting
pain
For
I
have
not
denied
the
sayings
of
the
Holy
One
11
Do
I
have
the
strength
to
keep
waiting
And
what
end
awaits
me
that
I
should
continue
to
live
12
Is
my
strength
like
that
of
rock
Or
is
my
flesh
made
of
copper
13
Is
there
any
way
that
I
can
help
myselfWhen
all
my
means
of
support
has
been
driven
from
me
14
Anyone
who
withholds
loyal
love
from
his
fellow
manWill
forsake
the
fear
of
the
Almighty
15
My
own
brothers
have
been
as
treacherous
as
a
winter
stream
Like
the
water
of
winter
streams
that
dry
up
16
They
are
darkened
by
ice
And
in
them
the
melting
snow
is
hidden
17
But
in
due
season
they
become
waterless
and
come
to
an
end
When
it
becomes
hot
they
dry
up
18
Their
course
is
diverted
They
flow
into
the
desert
and
vanish
19
The
caravans
of
Tema
look
for
them
The
travelers
from
Sheba
wait
for
them
20
They
are
ashamed
because
of
their
misplaced
trust
They
come
there
only
to
be
disappointed
21
For
this
is
how
you
have
become
to
me
You
have
seen
the
terror
of
my
calamity
and
you
are
afraid
22
Have
I
said
Give
me
something

Or
requested
that
you
make
a
gift
for
me
from
your
wealth
23
Have
I
asked
to
be
rescued
from
the
hand
of
an
enemyOr
to
be
saved
from
oppressors
24
Instruct
me
and
I
will
be
silent
Help
me
to
understand
my
mistake
25
Honest
words
are
not
painful
But
what
benefit
can
be
found
in
your
reproof
26
Are
you
scheming
to
reprove
my
words
A
desperate
mans
sayings
which
the
wind
blows
away
27
You
would
also
cast
lots
over
an
orphanAnd
sell
your
own
friend
28
So
now
turn
and
look
at
me
For
I
would
not
lie
to
your
very
faces
29
Reconsider
please—do
not
misjudge
me—Yes
reconsider
for
my
righteousness
is
yet
intact
30
Is
my
tongue
speaking
unjustly
Does
my
palate
not
discern
that
something
is
wrong
1
Is
not
the
life
of
mortal
man
on
earth
like
compulsory
labor
And
are
not
his
days
like
those
of
a
hired
worker

2
Like
a
slave
he
longs
for
the
shadow
And
like
a
hired
worker
he
waits
for
his
wages

3
Thus
I
have
been
assigned
months
of
futilityAnd
nights
of
misery
have
been
counted
out
for
me

4
When
I
lie
down
I
ask
When
will
I
get
up
But
as
the
night
drags
on
I
toss
restlessly
until
the
dawning
of
the
day

5
My
flesh
is
covered
with
maggots
and
clods
of
dirt
My
skin
is
full
of
scabs
and
pus

6
My
days
go
by
more
quickly
than
a
weavers
shuttle
And
they
come
to
an
end
without
hope

7
Remember
that
my
life
is
wind
That
my
eye
will
never
again
see
happiness

8
The
eye
that
sees
me
now
will
see
me
no
more
Your
eyes
will
look
for
me
but
I
will
be
gone

9
Like
a
cloud
that
fades
and
vanishes
The
one
who
goes
down
to
the
Grave
does
not
come
back
up
10
He
will
not
return
again
to
his
house
And
his
place
will
acknowledge
him
no
more
11
Therefore
I
will
not
restrain
my
mouth
I
will
speak
in
the
anguish
of
my
spirit
I
will
complain
in
my
bitter
distress
12
Am
I
the
sea
or
a
sea
monster
That
you
should
set
a
guard
over
me
13
When
I
say
My
couch
will
comfort
me
My
bed
will
help
ease
my
misery

14
Then
you
terrify
me
with
dreamsAnd
frighten
me
with
visions
15
So
that
I
would
choose
suffocation
Yes
death
rather
than
this
body
of
mine
16
I
loathe
my
life
I
do
not
want
to
go
on
living
Leave
me
alone
for
my
days
are
like
a
breath
17
What
is
mortal
man
that
you
should
concern
yourself
with
himAnd
fix
your
attention
on
him
18
Why
do
you
inspect
him
every
morningAnd
test
him
every
moment
19
Will
you
not
look
away
from
meAnd
leave
me
alone
long
enough
to
swallow
my
saliva
20
If
I
have
sinned
how
could
I
harm
you
the
Observer
of
mankind
Why
have
you
made
me
your
target
Have
I
become
a
burden
to
you
21
Why
do
you
not
pardon
my
transgressionAnd
excuse
my
error
For
soon
I
will
lie
down
in
the
dust
And
you
will
look
for
me
but
I
will
be
gone
1
Bildad
the
Shuhite
then
said
in
reply

2
How
long
will
you
keep
speaking
like
this
The
words
of
your
mouth
are
but
a
mighty
wind

3
Will
God
pervert
justice
Or
will
the
Almighty
pervert
righteousness

4
If
your
sons
sinned
against
him
He
let
them
be
punished
for
their
revolt
5
But
if
you
would
just
look
to
GodAnd
plead
with
the
Almighty
for
favor
6
And
if
you
were
truly
pure
and
upright
He
would
pay
attention
to
youAnd
restore
you
to
your
rightful
place

7
And
though
your
beginning
was
small
Your
future
would
be
great

8
Ask
please
the
former
generation
And
pay
attention
to
the
things
their
fathers
found
out

9
For
we
were
born
only
yesterday
and
we
know
nothing
Because
our
days
on
earth
are
a
shadow
10
Will
they
not
instruct
youAnd
tell
you
what
they
know
11
Will
a
papyrus
plant
grow
tall
where
there
is
no
marsh
Will
a
reed
grow
tall
without
water
12
While
it
is
still
in
the
bud
not
yet
plucked
off
It
will
dry
up
before
any
other
plant
13
This
is
the
outcome
of
all
who
forget
God
For
the
hope
of
the
godless
will
perish
14
Whose
confidence
is
in
vainAnd
whose
trust
is
as
fragile
as
a
spiders
web
15
He
will
lean
against
his
house
but
it
will
not
keep
standing
He
will
try
to
hold
on
to
it
but
it
will
not
last
16
He
is
a
moist
plant
in
the
sunlight
And
his
shoots
spread
out
in
the
garden
17
In
a
heap
of
stones
his
roots
become
entwined
He
looks
for
a
house
among
the
stones
18
But
when
he
is
uprooted
from
his
place
That
place
will
deny
him
and
say
I
have
never
seen
you
19
Yes
that
is
how
he
will
disappear
Then
others
will
spring
up
from
the
dust
20
Surely
God
will
not
reject
those
who
keep
integrity
Nor
will
he
support
evil
men
21
For
he
will
yet
fill
your
mouth
with
laughterAnd
your
lips
with
shouts
of
joy
22
Those
hating
you
will
be
clothed
with
shame
And
the
tent
of
wicked
ones
will
be
no
more
1
Job
said
in
reply

2
For
a
fact
I
know
that
this
is
so
But
how
can
mortal
man
be
in
the
right
in
a
case
with
God

3
If
someone
wishes
to
argue
with
Him
That
one
could
not
answer
one
of
His
questions
in
a
thousand

4
He
is
wise
in
heart
and
mighty
in
power
Who
can
resist
him
and
come
off
uninjured

5
He
moves
mountains
without
anyone
knowing
it
He
overturns
them
in
his
anger

6
He
shakes
the
earth
out
of
its
place
So
that
its
pillars
tremble

7
He
commands
the
sun
not
to
shineAnd
seals
off
the
light
of
the
stars
8
He
spreads
out
the
heavens
by
himself
And
he
treads
upon
the
high
waves
of
the
sea

9
He
made
the
Ash
the
Kesil
and
the
Kimah
constellations
And
the
constellations
of
the
southern
sky
10
He
does
great
and
unsearchable
things
Wonderful
things
that
cannot
be
counted
11
He
passes
by
me
and
I
cannot
see
him
He
moves
past
me
but
I
do
not
discern
him
12
When
he
snatches
something
who
can
resist
him
Who
can
say
to
him
What
are
you
doing
13
God
will
not
restrain
his
anger
Even
the
helpers
of
Rahab
will
bow
down
to
him
14
How
much
more
when
I
answer
himMust
I
choose
my
words
carefully
to
argue
with
him
15
Even
if
I
were
in
the
right
I
would
not
answer
him
I
could
only
plead
for
mercy
from
my
judge
16
If
I
call
out
to
him
will
he
answer
me
I
do
not
believe
that
he
will
listen
to
my
voice
17
For
he
crushes
me
with
a
stormAnd
multiplies
my
wounds
for
no
reason
18
He
does
not
let
me
catch
my
breath
He
keeps
filling
me
with
bitter
things
19
If
it
is
a
matter
of
power
he
is
the
strong
one
If
it
is
a
matter
of
justice
he
says
Who
can
call
me
to
account
20
If
I
were
in
the
right
my
own
mouth
would
condemn
me
Even
if
I
keep
my
integrity
he
will
declare
me
guilty
21
Even
if
I
keep
my
integrity
I
am
not
confident
about
myself
I
reject
this
life
of
mine
22
It
is
all
the
same
That
is
why
I
say
He
destroys
the
innocent
and
the
wicked
alike
23
If
a
flash
flood
should
cause
sudden
death
He
would
mock
at
the
despair
of
the
innocent
24
The
earth
has
been
handed
over
to
the
wicked
He
covers
the
eyes
of
its
judges
If
it
is
not
he
then
who
is
it
25
Now
my
days
are
swifter
than
a
runner
They
run
away
without
seeing
good
26
They
glide
by
like
reed
boats
Like
eagles
that
swoop
down
on
their
prey
27
If
I
say
I
will
forget
my
complaint
I
will
change
my
expression
and
be
cheerful

28
I
would
still
be
afraid
because
of
all
my
pains
And
I
know
you
would
not
find
me
innocent
29
I
would
be
found
guilty
So
why
should
I
struggle
in
vain
30
If
I
wash
myself
in
water
from
melting
snow
And
I
cleanse
my
hands
in
lye
31
Then
you
would
dip
me
in
a
pit
So
that
even
my
own
garments
would
detest
me
32
For
he
is
not
a
man
like
me
that
I
may
answer
him
That
we
should
go
to
court
together
33
There
is
no
person
to
decide
between
us
Who
could
serve
as
our
judge
34
If
he
would
stop
beating
meAnd
not
let
his
terror
frighten
me
35
Then
I
would
speak
to
him
unafraid
For
it
is
not
in
me
to
speak
out
of
fear
1
I
loathe
my
life
I
will
give
vent
to
my
complaints
I
will
speak
out
in
my
bitter
distress

2
I
will
say
to
God
Do
not
pronounce
me
guilty
Tell
me
why
you
are
contending
with
me

3
Does
it
benefit
you
to
oppress
To
despise
the
work
of
your
handsWhile
you
favor
the
advice
of
the
wicked

4
Do
you
have
eyes
of
flesh
Or
do
you
see
as
mortal
man
does

5
Are
your
days
like
the
days
of
mortals
Or
are
your
years
like
those
of
a
man
6
That
you
should
search
out
my
errorAnd
keep
looking
for
my
sin

7
You
know
that
I
am
not
guilty
And
no
one
can
save
me
from
your
hand

8
Your
own
hands
have
shaped
me
and
made
me
But
now
you
would
completely
destroy
me

9
Remember
please
that
you
made
me
out
of
clay
But
now
you
make
me
return
to
dust
10
Did
you
not
pour
me
out
like
milkAnd
curdle
me
like
cheese
11
With
skin
and
flesh
you
clothed
me
And
with
bones
and
sinews
you
wove
me
together
12
You
have
given
me
life
and
loyal
love
You
have
guarded
my
spirit
with
your
care
13
But
you
secretly
intended
to
do
these
things
I
know
that
these
things
are
from
you
14
If
I
sinned
you
would
watch
me
And
you
would
not
acquit
me
of
my
error
15
If
I
am
guilty
too
bad
for
me
And
even
if
I
am
innocent
I
cannot
raise
my
head
For
I
am
filled
with
dishonor
and
affliction
16
If
I
raise
my
head
up
you
hunt
for
me
like
a
lionAnd
again
show
your
power
against
me
17
You
bring
new
witnesses
against
meAnd
increase
your
anger
against
me
As
hardship
after
hardship
comes
upon
me
18
So
why
did
you
bring
me
out
from
the
womb
I
should
have
died
before
any
eye
could
see
me
19
It
would
have
been
as
though
I
never
existed
I
would
have
been
taken
straight
from
the
womb
to
the
grave
20
Are
not
my
days
few
Let
him
leave
me
alone
Let
him
turn
his
eyes
away
from
me
so
that
I
may
find
some
relief21
Before
I
go
away—and
I
will
not
return—To
the
land
of
deepest
darkness
22
To
the
land
of
utter
gloom
A
land
of
deep
shadow
and
disorder
Where
even
the
light
is
like
the
gloom
1
Zophar
the
Naamathite
said
in
reply

2
Will
all
these
words
go
unanswered
Or
will
a
lot
of
talking
make
someone
right

3
Will
your
empty
talk
silence
people
Will
no
one
rebuke
you
for
your
mocking
words

4
For
you
say
My
teaching
is
pure
And
I
am
clean
in
your
eyes

5
But
if
only
God
would
speakAnd
open
his
lips
to
you

6
Then
he
would
reveal
to
you
the
secrets
of
wisdom
For
practical
wisdom
has
many
sides
Then
you
would
realize
that
God
allows
some
of
your
error
to
be
forgotten

7
Can
you
discover
the
deep
things
of
GodOr
discover
everything
about
the
Almighty

8
It
is
higher
than
heaven
What
can
you
accomplish
It
is
deeper
than
the
Grave
What
can
you
know

9
It
is
longer
than
the
earthAnd
broader
than
the
sea
10
If
he
passes
by
and
detains
someone
and
convenes
a
court
Who
can
resist
him
11
For
he
knows
when
men
are
deceitful
When
he
sees
what
is
evil
will
he
not
take
notice
12
But
an
empty-headed
man
will
understandOnly
when
a
wild
donkey
can
give
birth
to
a
man
13
If
only
you
would
prepare
your
heartAnd
stretch
out
your
hands
to
him
14
If
your
hand
is
doing
wrong
put
it
far
away
And
let
no
unrighteousness
dwell
in
your
tents
15
For
then
you
could
lift
up
your
face
with
no
defect
You
could
stand
firm
free
of
fear
16
For
then
you
will
forget
your
trouble
You
will
remember
it
as
waters
that
have
flowed
past
you
17
Your
life
will
become
brighter
than
midday
Even
its
darkness
will
be
like
the
morning
18
You
will
be
confident
because
there
is
hope
And
you
will
look
around
and
lie
down
in
security
19
You
will
lie
down
with
no
one
to
make
you
afraid
And
many
people
will
seek
your
favor
20
But
the
eyes
of
the
wicked
will
fail
And
they
will
find
no
place
to
escape
And
their
only
hope
will
be
death
1
Then
Job
said
in
reply

2
Surely
you
are
the
people
who
know
And
wisdom
will
die
out
with
you

3
But
I
too
have
understanding
I
am
not
inferior
to
you
Who
does
not
know
these
things

4
I
have
become
a
laughingstock
to
my
companions
One
calling
to
God
for
an
answer
A
righteous
and
blameless
man
is
a
laughingstock

5
The
carefree
person
has
contempt
for
calamity
Thinking
it
is
only
for
those
whose
feet
are
unsteady

6
The
tents
of
robbers
are
at
peace
And
those
who
provoke
God
are
secure
Those
who
have
their
god
in
their
hands

7
However
ask
please
the
animals
and
they
will
instruct
you
Also
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
they
will
tell
you

8
Or
give
consideration
to
the
earth
and
it
will
instruct
you
And
the
fish
of
the
sea
will
declare
it
to
you

9
Who
among
all
these
does
not
knowThat
the
hand
of
Jehovah
has
done
this
10
In
his
hand
is
the
life
of
every
living
thingAnd
the
spirit
of
every
human
11
Does
not
the
ear
test
out
wordsAs
the
tongue
tastes
food
12
Is
not
wisdom
found
among
the
aged
And
does
not
understanding
come
with
a
long
life
13
With
him
there
are
wisdom
and
mightiness
He
has
counsel
and
understanding
14
When
he
tears
something
down
it
cannot
be
rebuilt
What
he
has
shut
no
man
can
open
15
When
he
withholds
the
waters
everything
dries
up
When
he
sends
them
out
they
overwhelm
the
earth
16
With
him
there
are
strength
and
practical
wisdom
To
him
belong
the
one
going
astray
and
the
one
leading
astray
17
He
makes
counselors
go
barefoot
And
he
makes
fools
of
judges
18
He
loosens
the
bonds
imposed
by
kings
And
he
binds
a
belt
around
their
waist
19
He
makes
priests
walk
barefoot
And
he
overthrows
those
who
are
firmly
established
in
power
20
He
deprives
trusted
advisers
of
speechAnd
takes
away
the
sensibleness
of
old
men
21
He
pours
out
contempt
upon
nobles
And
he
makes
powerful
ones
weak
22
He
reveals
deep
things
from
the
darkness
And
he
brings
deep
darkness
into
the
light
23
He
makes
nations
grow
great
in
order
to
destroy
them
He
enlarges
nations
that
he
may
lead
them
into
exile
24
He
takes
away
the
understanding
of
the
leaders
of
the
peopleAnd
makes
them
wander
in
trackless
wastelands
25
They
grope
in
darkness
where
there
is
no
light
He
makes
them
wander
about
like
drunken
men
1
Yes
my
eye
has
seen
all
of
this
My
ear
has
heard
and
understood
it

2
What
you
know
I
also
know
I
am
not
inferior
to
you

3
For
my
part
I
would
rather
speak
to
the
Almighty
himself
I
desire
to
argue
my
case
with
God

4
But
you
are
smearing
me
with
lies
All
of
you
are
useless
physicians

5
If
only
you
would
keep
absolutely
silent
That
would
show
wisdom
on
your
part

6
Listen
please
to
my
arguments
And
pay
attention
to
the
pleadings
of
my
lips

7
Will
you
speak
unjustly
on
Gods
behalf
And
will
you
speak
deceitfully
for
him

8
Will
you
take
his
side
Will
you
try
to
plead
the
case
of
the
true
God

9
Would
it
turn
out
well
if
he
examined
you
Will
you
fool
him
as
you
would
a
mortal
man
10
He
will
surely
rebuke
youIf
you
secretly
try
to
show
favoritism
11
Will
not
his
very
dignity
terrify
youAnd
the
dread
of
him
fall
upon
you
12
Your
wise
sayings
are
proverbs
of
ashes
Your
defenses
are
as
fragile
as
defenses
of
clay
13
Keep
silent
before
me
so
that
I
may
speak
Then
let
whatever
may
come
upon
me
come
14
Why
do
I
put
myself
in
dangerAnd
take
my
life
in
my
hands
15
Though
he
may
slay
me
I
would
still
wait
I
would
argue
my
case
before
his
face
16
He
would
then
become
my
salvation
For
no
godless
person
may
come
in
before
him
17
Listen
closely
to
my
word
Pay
attention
to
my
declaration
18
See
now
I
have
prepared
my
legal
case
I
know
I
am
in
the
right
19
Who
will
contend
with
me
I
would
die
if
I
were
to
stay
silent
20
Only
grant
two
things
to
me
O
God
So
that
I
will
not
conceal
myself
from
before
you
21
Remove
your
heavy
hand
far
away
from
me
And
do
not
let
the
fear
of
you
terrify
me
22
Either
call
and
I
will
answer
Or
let
me
speak
and
you
answer
me
23
What
are
my
errors
and
sins
Reveal
to
me
my
transgression
and
my
sin
24
Why
do
you
hide
your
faceAnd
consider
me
your
enemy
25
Will
you
try
to
frighten
a
windblown
leafOr
chase
after
dry
stubble
26
For
you
keep
recording
bitter
accusations
against
me
And
you
make
me
answer
for
the
sins
of
my
youth
27
You
have
put
my
feet
in
stocks
You
scrutinize
all
my
paths
And
you
trace
out
each
of
my
footprints
28
So
man
decays
like
something
rotten
Like
a
garment
eaten
by
moths
1
Man
born
of
woman
Is
short-lived
and
filled
with
trouble

2
He
comes
up
like
a
blossom
and
then
withers
away
He
flees
like
a
shadow
and
disappears

3
Yes
you
have
fixed
your
eye
upon
him
And
you
bring
him
into
judgment
with
yourself

4
Who
can
produce
someone
clean
from
someone
unclean
No
one
can

5
If
his
days
are
decided
The
number
of
his
months
is
with
you
You
have
set
a
limit
for
him
that
he
may
not
go
beyond

6
Turn
your
gaze
away
from
him
so
that
he
may
rest
Until
like
a
hired
worker
he
finishes
out
his
day

7
For
there
is
hope
even
for
a
tree
If
it
is
cut
down
it
will
sprout
again
And
its
twigs
will
continue
to
grow

8
If
its
root
grows
old
in
the
groundAnd
its
stump
dies
in
the
soil
9
At
the
scent
of
water
it
will
sprout
And
it
will
produce
branches
like
a
new
plant
10
But
a
man
dies
and
lies
powerless
When
a
human
expires
where
is
he
11
Waters
disappear
from
the
sea
And
a
river
drains
away
and
dries
up
12
Man
also
lies
down
and
does
not
get
up
Until
heaven
is
no
more
they
will
not
wake
up
Nor
will
they
be
aroused
from
their
sleep
13
O
that
in
the
Grave
you
would
conceal
me
That
you
would
hide
me
until
your
anger
passes
by
That
you
would
set
a
time
limit
for
me
and
remember
me
14
If
a
man
dies
can
he
live
again
I
will
wait
all
the
days
of
my
compulsory
serviceUntil
my
relief
comes
15
You
will
call
and
I
will
answer
you
You
will
long
for
the
work
of
your
hands
16
But
for
now
you
keep
counting
my
every
step
You
watch
only
for
my
sin
17
My
transgression
is
sealed
up
in
a
bag
And
you
seal
up
my
error
with
glue
18
As
a
mountain
falls
and
crumbles
awayAnd
a
rock
is
dislodged
from
its
place
19
As
water
wears
away
stonesAnd
its
torrents
wash
away
earths
soil
So
you
have
destroyed
the
hope
of
mortal
man
20
You
keep
overpowering
him
until
he
perishes
You
change
his
appearance
and
you
send
him
away
21
His
sons
are
honored
but
he
does
not
know
it
They
become
insignificant
but
he
does
not
realize
it
22
He
feels
pain
only
while
he
is
still
in
his
flesh
He
mourns
only
while
he
is
still
alive
1
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
said
in
reply

2
Will
a
wise
person
answer
with
empty
arguments
Or
will
he
fill
his
belly
with
the
east
wind

3
Reproving
with
mere
words
is
useless
And
talk
alone
is
of
no
benefit

4
For
you
undermine
the
fear
of
God
And
you
diminish
any
concern
for
God

5
For
your
error
dictates
what
you
say
And
you
choose
crafty
speech

6
Your
own
mouth
condemns
you
and
not
I
Your
own
lips
testify
against
you

7
Were
you
the
first
man
ever
born
Or
was
your
birth
before
that
of
the
hills

8
Do
you
listen
to
the
confidential
talk
of
God
Or
do
you
limit
wisdom
to
yourself

9
What
do
you
know
that
we
do
not
know
What
do
you
understand
that
we
do
not
10
Both
the
gray-haired
and
the
aged
are
among
us
Men
much
older
than
your
father
11
Are
Gods
consolations
not
enough
for
you
Or
words
spoken
gently
to
you
12
Why
does
your
heart
carry
you
away
And
why
do
your
eyes
flash
with
anger
13
For
you
turn
your
spirit
against
God
himself
And
you
allow
such
words
to
go
out
of
your
own
mouth
14
What
is
mortal
man
that
he
should
be
pure
Or
anyone
born
of
a
woman
that
he
should
be
righteous
15
Look
He
has
no
faith
in
his
holy
ones
And
even
the
heavens
are
not
pure
in
his
eyes
16
How
much
less
so
when
a
person
is
detestable
and
corrupt
A
man
who
drinks
in
unrighteousness
just
like
water
17
I
will
inform
you
listen
to
me
I
will
relate
what
I
have
seen
18
What
wise
men
have
related
from
their
fathers
Things
they
have
not
hidden
19
To
them
alone
the
land
was
given
And
no
stranger
passed
among
them
20
A
wicked
person
suffers
torment
all
his
days
Throughout
all
the
years
reserved
for
the
tyrant
21
Terrifying
sounds
are
in
his
ears
In
a
time
of
peace
marauders
attack
him
22
He
does
not
believe
that
he
will
escape
from
darkness
He
is
reserved
for
a
sword
23
He
wanders
about
in
search
of
food—where
is
it
He
well
knows
that
the
day
of
darkness
is
at
hand
24
Distress
and
anguish
keep
terrifying
him
They
overpower
him
like
a
king
ready
to
launch
an
attack
25
For
he
raises
his
hand
against
God
himselfAnd
tries
to
defy
the
Almighty
26
He
stubbornly
rushes
against
Him
With
his
thick
strong
shield
27
His
face
is
covered
with
fat
And
his
hips
bulge
with
fat
28
He
resides
in
cities
that
will
be
brought
to
ruin
In
houses
where
no
one
will
dwell
Which
will
become
heaps
of
stones
29
He
will
not
grow
rich
and
his
wealth
will
not
accumulate
Nor
will
his
possessions
spread
over
the
land
30
He
will
not
escape
from
darkness
A
flame
will
dry
up
his
twig
And
he
will
pass
away
by
a
blast
of
Gods
mouth
31
He
should
not
go
astray
and
trust
in
what
is
worthless
For
what
he
gets
in
exchange
will
be
worthless
32
It
will
happen
before
his
day
And
his
branches
will
never
flourish
33
He
will
be
like
a
vine
that
shakes
off
its
unripe
grapes
And
like
an
olive
tree
that
casts
off
its
blossoms
34
For
the
assembly
of
godless
ones
is
sterile
And
fire
will
consume
the
tents
of
bribery
35
They
conceive
trouble
and
give
birth
to
what
is
wicked
And
their
womb
produces
deceit
1
Job
said
in
reply

2
I
have
heard
many
things
like
these
before
All
of
you
are
troublesome
comforters

3
Is
there
an
end
to
empty
words
What
provokes
you
to
answer
this
way

4
I
could
also
speak
as
you
do
If
you
were
in
my
place
I
could
make
persuasive
speeches
against
youAnd
shake
my
head
at
you

5
Instead
though
I
would
strengthen
you
with
the
words
of
my
mouth
And
the
consolation
of
my
lips
would
bring
relief

6
If
I
speak
my
own
pain
is
not
relieved
And
if
I
stop
speaking
how
much
is
my
pain
reduced

7
But
now
he
has
made
me
weary
He
has
devastated
my
whole
household

8
You
also
seize
me
and
it
has
become
a
witness
So
that
my
own
skinniness
rises
up
and
testifies
to
my
face

9
His
anger
has
torn
me
to
pieces
and
he
harbors
animosity
against
me
He
grinds
his
teeth
against
me
My
adversary
pierces
me
with
his
eyes
10
They
have
opened
their
mouth
wide
against
me
And
they
have
scornfully
struck
my
cheeks
In
large
numbers
they
gather
against
me
11
God
hands
me
over
to
young
boys
And
he
thrusts
me
into
the
hands
of
the
wicked
12
I
was
untroubled
but
he
shattered
me
He
grabbed
me
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
crushed
me
Then
he
set
me
up
as
his
target
13
His
archers
surround
me
He
pierces
my
kidneys
and
feels
no
compassion
He
pours
out
my
gall
on
the
earth
14
He
breaks
through
against
me
with
breach
after
breach
He
rushes
at
me
like
a
warrior
15
I
have
sewn
sackcloth
together
to
cover
my
skin
And
I
have
buried
my
dignity
in
the
dust
16
My
face
is
red
from
weeping
And
on
my
eyelids
is
deep
shadow
17
Although
my
hands
have
done
no
violenceAnd
my
prayer
is
pure
18
O
earth
do
not
cover
my
blood
And
let
there
be
no
resting-place
for
my
outcry
19
Even
now
my
witness
is
in
the
heavens
The
one
who
can
testify
for
me
is
in
the
heights
20
My
companions
ridicule
meAs
my
eye
sheds
tears
to
God
21
Let
someone
arbitrate
between
a
man
and
God
As
one
would
between
a
man
and
his
fellow
22
For
the
years
to
come
are
few
And
I
will
go
away
on
the
path
of
no
return
1
My
spirit
has
been
broken
my
days
have
been
extinguished
The
graveyard
awaits
me

2
Mockers
surround
me
And
my
eye
must
gaze
at
their
rebellious
behavior

3
Please
accept
my
security
and
keep
it
with
you
Who
else
will
shake
hands
with
me
and
pledge
in
my
behalf

4
For
you
have
concealed
discernment
from
their
heart
That
is
why
you
do
not
exalt
them

5
He
may
offer
to
share
with
his
friends
While
the
eyes
of
his
children
fail

6
He
has
made
me
an
object
of
scorn
among
the
peoples
So
that
I
became
one
in
whose
face
they
spit

7
From
anguish
my
eyes
grow
dim
And
all
my
limbs
are
but
a
shadow

8
Upright
people
stare
in
amazement
at
this
And
the
innocent
one
is
disturbed
over
the
godless

9
The
righteous
one
keeps
holding
fast
to
his
way
And
the
one
with
clean
hands
grows
stronger
10
However
you
may
all
come
and
resume
your
arguing
For
I
have
not
found
anyone
wise
among
you
11
My
days
are
finished
My
plans
the
desires
of
my
heart
have
been
shattered
12
They
keep
turning
night
into
day
Saying
Light
must
be
near
because
it
is
dark
13
If
I
wait
the
Grave
will
become
my
home
I
will
spread
out
my
bed
in
darkness
14
I
will
call
out
to
the
pit
You
are
my
father
To
the
maggot
My
mother
and
my
sister
15
Where
then
is
my
hope
Who
can
see
hope
for
me
16
It
will
go
down
to
the
barred
gates
of
the
GraveWhen
we
all
descend
together
into
the
dust
1
Bildad
the
Shuhite
said
in
reply

2
How
long
before
you
stop
making
such
speeches
Show
some
understanding
so
that
we
may
then
speak

3
Why
should
we
be
viewed
as
animalsAnd
be
considered
stupid
in
your
eyes

4
Even
if
you
tear
yourself
to
pieces
in
your
anger
Will
the
earth
be
abandoned
for
your
sake
Or
will
the
rock
move
away
from
its
place

5
Yes
the
light
of
the
wicked
will
be
extinguished
And
the
flame
of
his
fire
will
not
shine

6
The
light
in
his
tent
will
certainly
grow
dark
And
the
lamp
over
him
will
be
extinguished

7
His
vigorous
stride
is
shortened
And
his
own
counsel
will
make
him
fall

8
For
his
feet
will
lead
him
into
a
net
And
he
will
wander
onto
its
mesh

9
A
trap
will
seize
him
by
the
heel
A
snare
will
catch
him
10
A
rope
is
hidden
for
him
on
the
ground
And
a
trap
lies
in
his
path
11
Terrors
frighten
him
on
all
sidesAnd
chase
him
at
his
feet
12
His
strength
fails
him
And
disaster
will
make
him
stagger
13
His
skin
is
eaten
away
The
most
deadly
disease
consumes
his
limbs
14
He
is
torn
away
from
the
security
of
his
tentAnd
marched
to
the
king
of
terrors
15
Strangers
will
live
in
his
tent
Sulfur
will
be
scattered
on
his
home
16
His
roots
will
dry
up
beneath
him
And
his
branches
will
wither
above
him
17
The
memory
of
him
will
fade
from
the
earth
And
in
the
street
his
name
will
be
unknown
18
He
will
be
driven
from
the
light
into
the
darknessAnd
chased
away
from
the
productive
land
19
He
will
have
no
offspring
and
no
descendants
among
his
people
And
he
will
be
without
a
survivor
in
the
place
where
he
lives
20
When
his
day
comes
the
people
in
the
West
will
be
appalledAnd
the
people
in
the
East
will
be
seized
with
horror
21
This
is
what
happens
to
the
tents
of
a
wrongdoerAnd
to
the
place
of
the
one
who
has
not
known
God
1
Job
said
in
reply

2
How
long
will
you
keep
irritating
my
soul
Crushing
me
with
words

3
These
ten
times
you
have
rebuked
me
You
are
not
ashamed
to
deal
harshly
with
me

4
And
if
indeed
I
made
a
mistake
My
error
remains
with
me

5
If
you
insist
on
exalting
yourselves
over
me
Claiming
that
the
reproach
against
me
is
justified
6
Know
then
that
it
is
God
who
has
misled
me
And
he
has
caught
me
in
his
hunting
net

7
Look
I
keep
crying
out
Violence
but
I
get
no
answer
I
keep
crying
for
help
but
there
is
no
justice

8
My
path
he
has
blocked
with
a
stone
wall
and
I
cannot
pass
by
He
has
covered
my
roadways
with
darkness

9
He
has
stripped
me
of
my
gloryAnd
removed
the
crown
from
my
head
10
He
breaks
me
down
on
all
sides
until
I
perish
My
hope
he
uproots
like
a
tree
11
His
anger
burns
against
me
And
he
views
me
as
his
enemy
12
His
troops
come
together
and
besiege
me
And
they
camp
around
my
tent
13
My
own
brothers
he
has
driven
far
away
from
me
And
those
who
know
me
have
turned
away
from
me
14
My
close
companions
are
gone
And
those
whom
I
knew
well
have
forgotten
me
15
Guests
in
my
house
and
my
slave
girls
consider
me
a
stranger
I
am
a
foreigner
in
their
eyes
16
I
call
for
my
servant
but
he
does
not
respond
With
my
mouth
I
beg
him
for
compassion
17
My
very
breath
has
become
loathsome
to
my
wife
And
I
am
a
stench
to
my
own
brothers
18
Even
young
children
despise
me
When
I
rise
up
they
begin
jeering
at
me
19
All
my
close
friends
detest
me
And
those
whom
I
loved
have
turned
against
me
20
My
bones
stick
to
my
skin
and
my
flesh
And
I
escape
with
the
skin
of
my
teeth
21
Show
me
mercy
my
companions
show
me
mercy
For
Gods
own
hand
has
touched
me
22
Why
do
you
keep
persecuting
me
as
God
does
Attacking
me
without
letup
23
If
only
my
words
were
written
down
If
only
they
could
be
inscribed
in
a
book
24
O
that
they
were
carved
forever
in
the
rock
With
an
iron
stylus
and
lead
25
For
I
well
know
that
my
redeemer
is
alive
He
will
come
later
and
rise
up
over
the
earth
26
After
my
skin
has
thus
been
destroyed
While
yet
in
my
flesh
I
will
see
God
27
Whom
I
will
see
for
myself
Whom
my
own
eyes
will
see
not
someone
elses
But
deep
inside
I
feel
overwhelmed
28
For
you
say
In
what
way
are
we
persecuting
him
Since
the
root
of
the
problem
is
with
me
29
Be
in
fear
of
the
sword
yourselves
For
the
sword
brings
punishment
against
errors
You
should
know
that
there
is
a
judge

2
This
is
why
my
own
troubling
thoughts
urge
me
to
answerBecause
of
the
agitation
I
feel

3
I
have
heard
a
reproof
that
insults
me
And
my
understanding
impels
me
to
reply

4
Surely
you
must
have
always
known
this
For
it
has
been
so
since
man
was
put
on
the
earth
5
That
the
joyful
cry
of
the
wicked
is
briefAnd
the
rejoicing
of
the
godless
one
is
for
a
moment

6
Although
his
greatness
ascends
to
heavenAnd
his
head
reaches
to
the
clouds
7
He
will
perish
forever
like
his
own
dung
Those
who
used
to
see
him
will
say
Where
is
he

8
He
will
fly
off
like
a
dream
and
they
will
not
find
him
He
will
be
chased
away
like
a
vision
of
the
night

9
The
eye
that
once
saw
him
will
not
do
so
again
And
his
place
will
behold
him
no
more
10
His
own
children
will
seek
the
favor
of
the
poor
And
his
own
hands
will
give
back
his
wealth
11
His
bones
were
full
of
youthful
vigor
But
it
will
lie
down
with
him
in
mere
dust
12
If
what
is
bad
tastes
sweet
in
his
mouth
If
he
hides
it
under
his
tongue
13
If
he
savors
it
and
does
not
let
it
goBut
keeps
holding
it
in
his
mouth
14
His
food
will
turn
sour
inside
him
It
will
become
like
the
poison
of
cobras
within
him
15
He
has
swallowed
down
wealth
but
he
will
vomit
it
up
God
will
empty
it
out
of
his
belly
16
The
venom
of
cobras
he
will
suck
The
fangs
of
a
viper
will
kill
him
17
He
will
never
see
the
streams
of
water
The
torrents
of
honey
and
butter
18
He
will
give
back
his
goods
without
consuming
them
He
will
not
enjoy
the
wealth
from
his
trade
19
For
he
has
crushed
and
abandoned
the
poor
He
has
seized
a
house
that
he
did
not
build
20
But
he
will
feel
no
peace
within
himself
His
wealth
will
not
help
him
escape
21
There
is
nothing
left
for
him
to
devour
That
is
why
his
prosperity
will
not
last
22
When
his
wealth
reaches
its
peak
anxiety
will
overtake
him
The
full
force
of
misfortune
will
come
against
him
23
As
he
fills
his
belly
God
will
send
his
burning
anger
upon
him
Raining
it
down
upon
him
into
his
bowels
24
When
he
flees
from
weapons
of
iron
Arrows
from
a
copper
bow
will
pierce
him
25
He
pulls
an
arrow
from
his
back
A
glittering
weapon
from
his
gall
And
terror
seizes
him
26
Total
darkness
awaits
his
treasures
A
fire
that
no
one
fanned
will
consume
him
Calamity
awaits
any
survivors
in
his
tent
27
Heaven
will
uncover
his
error
The
earth
will
rise
up
against
him
28
A
flood
will
sweep
his
house
away
It
will
be
a
heavy
torrent
on
the
day
of
Gods
anger
29
This
is
the
wicked
mans
share
from
God
The
inheritance
that
God
has
decreed
for
him
1
Job

Listen
carefully
to
what
I
say
Let
this
be
the
consolation
you
give
me

3
Bear
with
me
while
I
speak
After
I
speak
you
may
then
mock
me

4
Is
my
complaint
directed
toward
a
man
If
it
were
would
I
not
lose
patience

5
Look
at
me
and
stare
in
amazement
Put
your
hand
over
your
mouth

6
When
I
think
about
it
I
am
disturbed
And
my
whole
body
shudders

7
Why
do
the
wicked
live
on
Grow
old
and
become
wealthy

8
Their
children
are
always
in
their
presence
And
they
get
to
see
their
descendants

9
Their
houses
are
secure
they
are
free
from
fear
And
God
does
not
punish
them
with
his
rod
10
Their
bulls
breed
without
failure
Their
cows
give
birth
and
do
not
miscarry
11
Their
boys
run
outside
just
like
a
flock
And
their
children
skip
about
12
They
sing
accompanied
by
tambourine
and
harpAnd
rejoice
at
the
sound
of
the
flute
13
They
spend
their
days
in
contentmentAnd
go
down
peacefully
to
the
Grave
14
But
they
say
to
the
true
God
Leave
us
alone
We
have
no
desire
to
know
your
ways
15
Who
is
the
Almighty
that
we
should
serve
him
What
would
we
gain
by
being
acquainted
with
him
16
But
I
know
that
they
do
not
control
their
own
prosperity
The
thinking
of
the
wicked
is
far
from
me
17
How
often
is
the
lamp
of
the
wicked
extinguished
How
often
does
disaster
come
upon
them
How
often
does
God
deal
out
destruction
to
them
in
his
anger
18
Do
they
ever
become
like
straw
before
the
windAnd
like
chaff
that
a
storm
wind
carries
away
19
God
will
store
up
a
mans
punishment
for
his
own
sons
But
may
God
repay
him
so
that
he
will
know
it
20
May
his
own
eyes
see
his
ruin
And
may
he
be
the
one
to
drink
from
the
rage
of
the
Almighty
21
For
what
does
he
care
about
what
happens
to
his
house
after
himIf
the
number
of
his
months
is
cut
short
22
Can
anyone
teach
knowledge
to
God
When
He
is
the
one
who
judges
even
the
highest
ones
23
One
man
dies
in
his
full
vigorWhen
he
is
completely
carefree
and
at
ease
24
When
his
thighs
are
padded
with
fatAnd
his
bones
are
strong
25
But
another
man
dies
deeply
distressed
Never
having
tasted
good
things
26
Together
they
will
lie
down
in
the
dust
And
maggots
will
cover
both
of
them
27
Look
I
know
exactly
what
you
are
thinkingAnd
the
schemes
you
devise
to
wrong
me
28
For
you
say
Where
is
the
house
of
the
prominent
man
And
where
is
the
tent
in
which
the
wicked
one
lived
29
Have
you
not
questioned
travelers
Do
you
not
carefully
study
their
observations
30
That
an
evil
person
is
spared
on
the
day
of
disasterAnd
rescued
on
the
day
of
fury
31
Who
will
confront
him
about
his
way
And
who
will
repay
him
for
what
he
has
done
32
When
he
is
carried
to
the
graveyard
A
vigil
will
be
kept
over
his
tomb
33
The
clods
of
earth
of
the
valley
will
be
sweet
to
him
And
all
mankind
follows
after
himLike
the
countless
number
before
him
34
So
why
offer
me
meaningless
comfort
There
is
nothing
but
deceit
in
your
answers
1
Eliphaz

Temanite
said

reply

2
Can
a
man
be
of
use
to
God
Can
anyone
with
insight
be
of
benefit
to
him

3
Does
the
Almighty
care
that
you
are
righteous
Or
does
he
gain
anything
because
you
follow
the
course
of
integrity

4
Will
he
punish
youAnd
enter
into
judgment
with
you
for
your
reverence

5
Is
it
not
because
your
own
wickedness
is
so
greatAnd
there
is
no
end
to
your
errors

6
For
you
seize
a
pledge
from
your
brothers
for
no
reason
And
you
strip
people
of
their
garments
leaving
them
naked

7
You
do
not
give
the
tired
one
a
drink
of
water
And
you
hold
back
food
from
the
hungry

8
The
land
belongs
to
the
powerful
man
And
the
favored
one
dwells
in
it

9
But
you
sent
away
widows
empty-handed
And
you
crushed
the
arms
of
fatherless
children
10
That
is
why
you
are
surrounded
by
traps
And
sudden
terrors
frighten
you
11
That
is
why
it
is
so
dark
that
you
cannot
see
And
a
flood
of
water
covers
you
12
Is
not
God
in
the
heights
of
heaven
And
see
how
high
all
the
stars
are
13
But
you
have
said
What
does
God
really
know
Can
he
judge
through
thick
gloom
14
Clouds
screen
him
off
so
that
he
does
not
seeAs
he
walks
about
on
the
vault
of
heaven
15
Will
you
follow
the
ancient
pathThat
wicked
men
have
walked
16
Men
who
have
been
snatched
away
before
their
time
Whose
foundation
was
washed
away
by
a
flood
17
They
were
saying
to
the
true
God
Leave
us
alone
And
What
can
the
Almighty
do
to
us
18
Yet
he
is
the
One
who
filled
their
houses
with
good
things
Such
wicked
thinking
is
far
from
my
own
19
The
righteous
will
see
this
and
rejoice
And
the
innocent
will
mock
them
and
say
20
Our
opponents
have
been
destroyed
And
a
fire
will
consume
what
is
left
of
them
21
Get
to
know
Him
and
you
will
be
at
peace
Then
good
things
will
come
your
way
22
Accept
the
law
from
his
mouth
And
keep
his
sayings
in
your
heart
23
If
you
return
to
the
Almighty
you
will
be
restored
If
you
remove
unrighteousness
from
your
tent
24
If
you
would
throw
your
gold
into
the
dustAnd
the
gold
of
Ophir
into
the
rocky
ravines
25
Then
the
Almighty
will
become
your
gold
And
he
will
be
your
choicest
silver
26
For
then
your
delight
will
be
in
the
Almighty
And
you
will
lift
up
your
face
to
God
27
You
will
entreat
him
and
he
will
hear
you
And
your
vows
you
will
pay
28
Whatever
you
decide
to
do
will
succeed
And
light
will
shine
upon
your
path
29
For
you
will
be
humiliated
when
you
speak
arrogantly
But
he
will
save
the
humble
30
He
will
rescue
those
who
are
innocent
So
if
your
hands
are
clean
you
will
certainly
be
rescued
1
Job
said
in
reply

2
Even
today
I
will
complain
stubbornly
My
strength
is
exhausted
because
of
my
sighing

3
If
only
I
knew
where
to
find
God
I
would
go
to
his
place
of
dwelling

4
I
would
present
my
case
before
himAnd
fill
my
mouth
with
arguments
5
I
would
learn
how
he
would
answer
meAnd
take
note
of
what
he
says
to
me

6
Would
he
contend
with
me
using
his
great
power
No
surely
he
would
give
me
a
hearing

7
There
the
upright
one
could
set
matters
straight
with
him
And
I
would
be
acquitted
once
and
for
all
by
my
Judge

8
But
if
I
go
east
he
is
not
there
And
I
return
and
I
cannot
find
him

9
When
he
is
working
on
the
left
I
cannot
look
upon
him
Then
he
turns
to
the
right
but
I
still
do
not
see
him
10
But
he
knows
the
path
I
have
taken
After
he
has
tested
me
I
will
come
out
as
pure
gold
11
My
feet
have
closely
followed
his
footsteps
I
have
kept
to
his
way
without
deviating
12
I
have
not
departed
from
the
commandment
of
his
lips
I
have
treasured
up
his
sayings
even
more
than
what
was
required
of
me
13
When
he
is
determined
who
can
resist
him
When
he
wants
to
do
something
he
does
it
14
For
he
will
carry
out
completely
what
has
been
determined
for
me
And
he
has
many
such
things
in
store
15
That
is
why
I
am
anxious
because
of
him
When
I
think
about
him
my
fear
grows
16
God
has
made
me
fainthearted
And
the
Almighty
has
made
me
afraid
17
But
I
have
not
yet
been
silenced
by
the
darknessNor
by
the
gloom
that
has
covered
my
face
1
Why
does
the
Almighty
not
set
a
time
Why
do
those
who
know
him
not
see
his
day

2
People
move
boundary
markers
They
carry
off
flocks
for
their
own
pasture

3
They
drive
away
the
donkey
of
fatherless
childrenAnd
seize
the
widows
bull
as
security
for
a
loan

4
They
force
the
poor
off
the
road
The
helpless
of
the
earth
must
hide
from
them

5
The
poor
forage
for
food
like
wild
donkeys
in
the
wilderness
They
seek
food
in
the
desert
for
their
children

6
They
must
harvest
in
anothers
fieldAnd
glean
from
the
vineyard
of
the
wicked

7
They
spend
the
night
naked
without
clothing
They
have
no
covering
for
the
cold

8
They
are
drenched
by
the
mountain
rains
They
cling
to
the
rocks
for
lack
of
shelter

9
The
fatherless
child
is
snatched
away
from
the
breast
And
the
garments
of
the
poor
are
taken
as
security
for
a
loan
10
Forcing
them
to
go
about
naked
without
clothing
And
hungry
as
they
carry
the
sheaves
of
grain
11
They
toil
among
the
terrace
walls
in
the
heat
of
the
day
They
tread
the
winepresses
yet
they
go
thirsty
12
The
dying
keep
groaning
in
the
city
The
fatally
wounded
cry
for
help
But
God
does
not
regard
this
as
improper
13
There
are
those
who
rebel
against
light
They
do
not
recognize
its
ways
And
they
do
not
follow
its
paths
14
The
murderer
rises
at
daybreak
He
slays
the
helpless
and
the
poor
While
at
night
he
engages
in
theft
15
The
eye
of
the
adulterer
waits
for
the
twilight
Saying
No
one
will
see
me
And
he
covers
his
face
16
In
the
darkness
they
break
into
houses
By
day
they
shut
themselves
in
They
are
strangers
to
the
light
17
For
morning
is
the
same
as
deep
darkness
for
them
They
are
familiar
with
the
terrors
of
deep
darkness
18
But
they
are
swiftly
carried
away
by
the
waters
Their
portion
of
the
land
will
be
cursed
They
will
not
return
to
their
vineyards
19
Just
as
drought
and
heat
take
away
the
melted
snow
The
Grave
takes
away
those
who
have
sinned
20
His
mother
will
forget
him
the
maggot
will
feast
on
him
He
will
be
remembered
no
more
And
unrighteousness
will
be
broken
just
like
a
tree
21
He
preys
on
the
barren
woman
And
mistreats
the
widow
22
God
will
use
his
strength
to
do
away
with
the
powerful
Though
they
may
rise
up
they
have
no
assurance
of
life
23
God
lets
them
become
confident
and
secure
But
his
eyes
are
on
everything
they
do
24
They
are
exalted
for
a
little
while
then
they
are
no
more
They
are
brought
low
and
gathered
like
everyone
else
They
are
cut
off
like
heads
of
grain
25
Now
who
can
prove
me
a
liarOr
refute
my
word
1
Bildad
the
Shuhite
said
in
reply

2
Rulership
and
fearsome
might
are
his
He
establishes
peace
in
heaven

3
Can
his
troops
be
numbered
Upon
whom
does
his
light
not
rise

4
So
how
can
mortal
man
be
righteous
before
God
Or
how
can
one
born
of
a
woman
be
innocent

5
Even
the
moon
is
not
brightAnd
the
stars
are
not
pure
in
his
eyes
6
How
much
less
so
mortal
man
who
is
a
maggot
And
a
son
of
man
who
is
a
worm
1
Job
said
in
reply

2
How
you
have
helped
the
one
with
no
power
How
you
have
saved
the
arm
that
has
no
strength

3
What
great
advice
you
have
given
to
the
one
lacking
wisdom
How
freely
you
have
revealed
your
practical
wisdom

4
To
whom
are
you
trying
to
speak
And
who
inspired
you
to
say
such
things

5
Those
who
are
powerless
in
death
tremble
They
are
even
lower
than
the
waters
and
their
inhabitants

6
The
Grave
is
naked
in
front
of
God
And
the
place
of
destruction
lies
uncovered

7
He
stretches
out
the
northern
sky
over
empty
space
Suspending
the
earth
upon
nothing
8
He
wraps
up
the
waters
in
his
clouds
So
that
the
clouds
do
not
burst
under
their
weight
9
He
shuts
off
the
view
of
his
throne
Spreading
out
his
cloud
over
it
10
He
marks
out
the
horizon
on
the
surface
of
the
waters
He
makes
a
boundary
between
light
and
darkness
11
The
very
pillars
of
heaven
shake
They
are
stunned
by
his
rebuke
12
He
stirs
up
the
sea
with
his
power
And
by
his
understanding
he
breaks
the
sea
monster
to
pieces
13
With
his
breath
he
makes
the
skies
clear
His
hand
pierces
the
elusive
serpent
14
Look
These
are
just
the
fringes
of
his
ways
Only
a
faint
whisper
has
been
heard
of
him
So
who
can
understand
his
mighty
thunder
1
Job
continued
his
discourse
saying

2
As
surely
as
God
lives
who
has
deprived
me
of
justice
As
the
Almighty
lives
who
has
made
me
bitter
3
As
long
as
my
breath
is
within
meAnd
spirit
from
God
is
in
my
nostrils
4
My
lips
will
not
speak
unrighteousness
Nor
will
my
tongue
mutter
deceit

5
It
is
unthinkable
for
me
to
declare
you
men
righteous
Until
I
die
I
will
not
renounce
my
integrity

6
I
will
maintain
my
righteousness
and
never
let
it
go
My
heart
will
not
condemn
me
as
long
as
I
live

7
May
my
enemy
become
like
the
wicked
Those
assaulting
me
like
the
unrighteous

8
For
what
hope
does
the
godless
man
have
when
he
is
destroyed
When
God
takes
away
his
life

9
Will
God
hear
his
outcryWhen
distress
comes
upon
him
10
Or
will
he
find
delight
in
the
Almighty
Will
he
call
on
God
at
all
times
11
I
will
teach
you
about
the
power
of
God
I
will
not
hide
anything
about
the
Almighty
12
Look
If
you
have
all
seen
visions
Why
are
your
speeches
completely
empty
13
This
is
the
wicked
mans
share
from
God
The
inheritance
that
tyrants
receive
from
the
Almighty
14
If
his
sons
become
many
they
will
fall
by
the
sword
And
his
descendants
will
not
have
enough
food
15
Those
who
survive
him
will
be
buried
by
the
plague
And
their
widows
will
not
weep
for
them
16
Even
if
he
piles
up
silver
like
the
dustAnd
stores
up
fine
clothing
like
the
clay
17
Though
he
may
gather
it
The
righteous
man
will
wear
it
And
the
innocent
will
divide
up
his
silver
18
The
house
he
builds
is
as
fragile
as
a
moths
cocoon
Like
a
shelter
made
by
a
watchman
19
He
will
go
to
bed
rich
but
will
gather
nothing
When
he
opens
his
eyes
nothing
will
be
there
20
Terror
overtakes
him
like
a
flood
A
storm
snatches
him
away
by
night
21
An
east
wind
will
carry
him
off
and
he
will
be
gone
It
sweeps
him
away
from
his
place
22
It
will
hurl
itself
at
him
without
pityAs
he
desperately
tries
to
flee
from
its
force
23
It
claps
its
hands
at
himAnd
whistles
at
him
from
its
place
1
There
is
a
place
to
mine
silverAnd
a
place
for
gold
that
they
refine
2
Iron
is
taken
from
the
ground
And
copper
is
smelted
from
rocks

3
Man
conquers
the
darkness
He
probes
to
the
limit
in
the
gloom
and
darkness
Searching
for
ore

4
He
sinks
a
shaft
far
from
where
people
reside
In
forgotten
places
far
from
where
people
walk
Some
men
descend
and
swing
suspended

5
Food
grows
on
top
of
the
earth
But
below
there
is
an
upheaval
as
if
by
fire

6
There
in
the
stones
is
sapphire
And
the
dust
contains
gold

7
No
bird
of
prey
knows
the
path
to
it
The
eye
of
a
black
kite
has
not
seen
it

8
No
majestic
beasts
have
trodden
on
it
The
young
lion
has
not
prowled
there

9
Man
strikes
the
flinty
rock
with
his
hand
He
overturns
the
mountains
at
their
foundation
10
He
cuts
water
channels
in
the
rock
His
eyes
spot
every
precious
thing
11
He
dams
up
the
sources
of
riversAnd
brings
what
was
hidden
to
the
light
12
But
wisdom—where
can
it
be
found
And
where
is
the
source
of
understanding
13
No
man
recognizes
its
value
And
it
cannot
be
found
in
the
land
of
the
living
14
The
deep
waters
say
It
is
not
in
me
And
the
sea
says
It
is
not
with
me
15
It
cannot
be
bought
with
pure
gold
Nor
can
silver
be
weighed
out
in
exchange
for
it
16
It
cannot
be
bought
with
gold
of
OphirNor
with
rare
onyx
and
sapphire
17
Gold
and
glass
cannot
be
compared
to
it
Nor
can
a
vessel
of
fine
gold
be
exchanged
for
it
18
Coral
and
crystal
are
not
worthy
of
mention
For
a
bagful
of
wisdom
is
worth
more
than
one
full
of
pearls
19
The
topaz
of
Cush
cannot
be
compared
to
it
It
cannot
be
purchased
even
with
pure
gold
20
But
from
where
does
wisdom
come
And
where
is
the
source
of
understanding
21
It
has
been
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
every
living
thingAnd
concealed
from
the
birds
of
the
heavens
22
Destruction
and
death
say
Our
ears
have
heard
only
a
report
of
it
23
God
understands
the
way
to
find
it
He
alone
knows
where
it
resides
24
For
he
looks
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
And
he
sees
everything
under
the
heavens
25
When
he
set
the
force
of
the
windAnd
measured
out
the
waters
26
When
he
made
a
regulation
for
the
rainAnd
a
path
for
the
thunderous
storm
cloud
27
Then
he
saw
wisdom
and
explained
it
He
established
and
tested
it
28
And
he
said
to
man
Look
The
fear
of
Jehovah—that
is
wisdom
And
to
turn
away
from
bad
is
understanding
1
Job
continued
his
discourse
saying

2
If
only
I
were
in
the
months
gone
by
In
the
days
when
God
was
watching
over
me
3
When
he
caused
his
lamp
to
shine
upon
my
head
When
I
walked
through
darkness
by
his
light
4
When
I
was
in
my
prime
When
Gods
friendship
was
felt
in
my
tent
5
When
the
Almighty
was
still
with
me
When
my
children
were
all
around
me
6
When
my
steps
were
awash
in
butter
And
the
rocks
poured
out
streams
of
oil
for
me

7
When
I
used
to
go
out
to
the
city
gateAnd
take
my
seat
in
the
public
square
8
The
young
men
would
see
me
and
step
aside
And
even
the
old
men
would
rise
and
remain
standing

9
Princes
refrained
from
speaking
They
would
put
their
hand
over
their
mouth
10
The
voices
of
the
prominent
men
were
silenced
Their
tongue
was
stuck
to
the
roof
of
their
mouth
11
Whoever
heard
me
would
speak
well
of
me
And
those
who
saw
me
would
testify
for
me
12
For
I
would
rescue
the
poor
who
cried
for
help
Along
with
the
fatherless
child
and
anyone
who
had
no
helper
13
The
one
about
to
perish
would
bless
me
And
I
made
the
heart
of
the
widow
rejoice
14
I
put
on
righteousness
as
my
clothing
My
justice
was
like
a
robe
and
a
turban
15
I
became
eyes
to
the
blindAnd
feet
to
the
lame
16
I
was
a
father
to
the
poor
I
would
investigate
the
legal
case
of
those
I
did
not
know
17
I
would
break
the
jaws
of
the
wrongdoerAnd
tear
the
prey
away
from
his
teeth
18
I
used
to
say
I
will
die
in
my
own
home
And
my
days
will
be
as
numerous
as
the
grains
of
sand
19
My
roots
will
spread
out
into
the
waters
And
dew
will
stay
all
night
on
my
branches
20
My
glory
is
constantly
renewed
And
the
bow
in
my
hand
will
keep
shooting
21
People
would
listen
expectantly
Waiting
in
silence
for
my
advice
22
After
I
had
spoken
they
had
nothing
more
to
say
My
words
would
fall
gently
on
their
ears
23
They
waited
for
me
as
for
the
rain
They
opened
their
mouth
wide
as
for
the
spring
rain
24
When
I
smiled
at
them
they
could
hardly
believe
it
The
light
of
my
face
would
reassure
them
25
I
gave
them
direction
as
their
head
And
I
lived
like
a
king
among
his
troops
Like
one
who
comforts
the
mourners
1
Now
they
laugh
at
me—Men
younger
than
I
am
Whose
fathers
I
would
have
refusedTo
put
with
the
dogs
that
guarded
my
flock

2
Of
what
use
was
the
power
of
their
hands
to
me
Their
vigor
has
perished

3
They
are
worn
out
from
want
and
hunger
They
gnaw
at
the
parched
groundThat
was
already
ruined
and
desolated

4
They
gather
the
salt
herb
from
the
bushes
Their
food
is
the
root
of
broom
trees

5
They
are
driven
out
of
the
community
People
shout
at
them
as
they
would
at
a
thief

6
They
live
on
the
slopes
of
ravines
In
holes
in
the
ground
and
in
the
rocks

7
From
the
bushes
they
cry
outAnd
huddle
together
among
the
nettles

8
As
sons
of
the
senseless
and
the
nameless
ones
They
have
been
driven
out
of
the
land

9
But
now
they
mock
me
even
in
their
songs
I
have
become
an
object
of
scorn
to
them
10
They
detest
me
and
keep
their
distance
from
me
They
do
not
hesitate
to
spit
in
my
face
11
Because
God
has
disarmed
me
and
humbled
me
They
throw
off
all
restraint
in
my
presence
12
On
my
right
they
rise
up
like
a
mob
They
put
me
to
flightAnd
put
up
barriers
of
destruction
in
my
path
13
They
tear
up
my
roadwaysAnd
make
my
calamity
worse
Without
anyone
to
stop
them
14
They
come
as
if
through
a
wide
breach
in
the
wall
They
roll
in
amid
the
devastation
15
Terror
overwhelms
me
My
dignity
is
driven
away
like
the
wind
And
my
salvation
vanishes
like
a
cloud
16
Now
my
life
ebbs
from
me
Days
of
affliction
take
hold
of
me
17
Aching
pierces
my
bones
at
night
The
gnawing
pain
never
stops
18
With
great
force
my
garment
is
disfigured
Like
the
collar
of
my
garment
it
chokes
me
19
God
has
thrown
me
down
into
the
mud
I
am
reduced
to
dust
and
ashes
20
I
cry
to
you
for
help
but
you
do
not
answer
me
I
stand
up
but
you
just
look
at
me
21
You
have
cruelly
turned
against
me
With
the
full
might
of
your
hand
you
assault
me
22
You
pick
me
up
and
carry
me
off
with
the
wind
Then
you
toss
me
about
in
the
storm
23
For
I
know
that
you
will
bring
me
down
to
death
To
the
house
where
everyone
living
will
meet
24
But
no
one
would
strike
at
a
broken
manAs
he
cries
for
help
during
his
time
of
disaster
25
Have
I
not
wept
for
those
who
have
fallen
on
hard
times
Have
I
not
grieved
for
the
poor
26
Although
I
hoped
for
good
bad
came
I
expected
the
light
but
darkness
came
27
The
churning
inside
me
did
not
stop
Days
of
affliction
confronted
me
28
I
walk
about
gloomy
there
is
no
sunlight
In
the
assembly
I
rise
and
cry
for
help
29
I
have
become
a
brother
to
jackalsAnd
a
companion
to
the
daughters
of
the
ostrich
30
My
skin
has
blackened
and
fallen
off
My
bones
burn
from
the
heat
31
My
harp
is
used
only
for
mourning
And
my
flute
for
the
sound
of
weeping
1
I
have
made
a
covenant
with
my
eyes
So
how
could
I
show
improper
attention
to
a
virgin

2
What
then
would
be
my
share
from
God
above
What
inheritance
from
the
Almighty
on
high

3
Does
not
disaster
await
the
wrongdoerAnd
calamity
those
doing
what
is
harmful

4
Does
he
not
see
my
waysAnd
count
all
my
steps

5
Have
I
ever
walked
in
untruth
Has
my
foot
hurried
to
deceive

6
Let
God
weigh
me
with
accurate
scales
Then
he
will
recognize
my
integrity

7
If
my
footsteps
deviate
from
the
wayOr
my
heart
has
followed
after
my
eyesOr
my
hands
have
been
defiled
8
Then
let
me
sow
seed
and
someone
else
eat
And
let
what
I
plant
be
uprooted

9
If
my
heart
has
been
enticed
by
a
womanAnd
I
have
lain
in
wait
at
my
neighbors
door
10
Then
let
my
wife
grind
grain
for
another
man
And
let
other
men
have
sexual
relations
with
her
11
For
that
would
be
shameful
conduct
An
error
deserving
punishment
by
the
judges
12
It
would
be
a
fire
that
would
devour
and
destroy
Consuming
even
the
roots
of
all
my
produce
13
If
I
denied
justice
to
my
male
or
female
servantsWhen
they
had
a
complaint
against
me
14
What
can
I
do
when
God
confronts
me
What
can
I
answer
him
when
he
calls
for
an
accounting
15
Did
not
the
One
who
made
me
in
the
womb
also
make
them
Was
it
not
the
same
One
who
formed
us
before
our
birth
16
If
I
refused
to
give
the
poor
what
they
desiredOr
saddened
the
eyes
of
the
widow
17
If
I
ate
my
portion
of
food
aloneWithout
sharing
it
with
the
orphans
18
For
from
my
youth
the
orphan
grew
up
with
me
as
though
I
were
his
father
And
I
have
been
a
guide
for
the
widow
from
childhood
19
If
I
saw
anyone
perishing
for
lack
of
clothingOr
a
poor
man
with
nothing
to
cover
himself
20
If
he
did
not
bless
meAs
he
warmed
himself
with
the
wool
of
my
sheep
21
If
I
shook
my
fist
against
the
orphanWhen
he
needed
my
assistance
in
the
city
gate
22
Then
let
my
arm
fall
from
my
shoulder
And
let
my
arm
be
broken
at
the
elbow
23
For
I
dreaded
disaster
from
God
And
I
could
not
stand
before
his
dignity
24
If
I
put
my
confidence
in
goldOr
said
to
fine
gold
You
are
my
security
25
If
I
found
my
joy
in
my
great
wealthBecause
of
the
many
possessions
I
acquired
26
If
I
saw
the
sun
shiningOr
the
moon
moving
in
its
splendor
27
And
my
heart
was
secretly
enticed
And
my
mouth
kissed
my
hand
in
worship
of
them
28
Then
that
would
be
an
error
deserving
punishment
by
the
judges
For
I
would
have
denied
the
true
God
above
29
Have
I
ever
rejoiced
over
the
destruction
of
my
enemyOr
gloated
because
evil
befell
him
30
I
never
allowed
my
mouth
to
sinBy
asking
for
his
life
in
an
oath
31
Have
the
men
of
my
tent
not
said
Who
can
find
anyone
who
has
not
been
satisfied
with
his
food
32
No
stranger
had
to
spend
the
night
outside
I
opened
my
doors
to
the
traveler
33
Have
I
ever
tried
to
cover
over
my
transgressions
like
other
men
By
hiding
my
error
in
the
pocket
of
my
garment
34
Have
I
been
in
fear
of
the
reaction
of
the
multitude
Or
have
I
been
terrified
by
the
contempt
of
other
families
Making
me
silent
and
afraid
to
go
outside
35
If
only
someone
would
listen
to
me
I
would
sign
my
name
to
what
I
have
said
Let
the
Almighty
answer
me
If
only
my
accuser
had
written
out
the
charges
in
a
document
36
I
would
carry
it
on
my
shoulder
And
I
would
bind
it
around
my
head
like
a
crown
37
I
would
give
him
an
accounting
for
every
step
I
took
I
would
approach
him
confidently
like
a
prince
38
If
my
own
ground
would
cry
out
against
meAnd
its
furrows
would
weep
together
39
If
I
have
eaten
its
fruitage
without
payment
Or
if
I
have
caused
its
owners
to
despair
40
Then
let
thorns
sprout
for
me
instead
of
wheatAnd
foul-smelling
weeds
instead
of
barley
The
words
of
Job
end
here
1
So
these
three
men
stopped
trying
to
answer
Job
because
he
was
convinced
of
his
own
righteousness
2
But
Elihu
the
son
of
Barachel
the
Buzite
of
the
family
of
Ram
had
become
very
angry
His
anger
blazed
against
Job
for
trying
to
prove
himself
right
rather
than
God
3
He
was
also
very
angry
with
Jobs
three
companions
because
they
could
not
find
an
answer
but
had
declared
God
wicked
4
Elihu
had
been
waiting
to
respond
to
Job
because
they
were
older
than
he
was
5
When
Elihu
saw
that
the
three
men
had
nothing
to
say
in
answer
his
anger
flared
up
6
So
Elihu
the
son
of
Barachel
the
Buzite
began
to
speak
saying
I
am
youngAnd
you
men
are
aged
So
I
respectfully
held
back
And
I
dared
not
tell
you
what
I
know

7
I
thought
Let
age
speak
And
let
a
multitude
of
years
declare
wisdom

8
But
it
is
the
spirit
in
people
The
breath
of
the
Almighty
that
gives
them
understanding

9
Age
alone
does
not
make
one
wise
Nor
is
it
only
old
men
who
understand
what
is
right
10
So
I
say
Listen
to
me
And
I
will
also
tell
you
what
I
know
11
Look
I
have
waited
for
your
words
I
kept
listening
to
your
reasoningAs
you
searched
for
things
to
say
12
I
paid
close
attention
to
you
But
none
of
you
could
prove
Job
wrongOr
answer
his
arguments
13
So
do
not
say
We
have
found
wisdom
It
is
God
who
refutes
him
not
a
man
14
He
did
not
direct
his
words
against
me
So
I
will
not
reply
to
him
with
your
arguments
15
They
are
dismayed
they
have
no
more
answers
They
have
nothing
left
to
say
16
I
have
waited
but
they
do
not
continue
speaking
They
just
stand
there
with
no
further
answer
17
So
I
too
will
give
an
answer
I
too
will
tell
what
I
know
18
For
I
am
full
of
words
The
spirit
within
me
compels
me
19
My
insides
are
like
wine
that
has
no
vent
Like
new
wineskins
ready
to
burst
20
Let
me
speak
so
that
I
can
find
relief
I
will
open
my
lips
and
give
an
answer
21
I
will
not
show
partiality
to
anyone
Nor
will
I
flatter
any
human
22
For
I
do
not
know
how
to
flatter
If
I
did
my
Maker
would
quickly
do
away
with
me
1
But
now
Job
please
hear
my
words
Listen
to
everything
I
say

2
Look
please
I
must
open
my
mouth
My
tongue
must
speak

3
My
words
declare
the
uprightness
of
my
heart
And
my
lips
sincerely
tell
what
I
know

4
Gods
own
spirit
made
me
And
the
Almightys
own
breath
brought
me
to
life

5
Reply
to
me
if
you
are
able
Present
your
arguments
before
me
take
your
position

6
Look
I
am
just
like
you
before
the
true
God
From
the
clay
I
too
was
shaped

7
So
no
fear
of
me
should
terrify
you
And
no
pressure
from
me
should
overwhelm
you

8
But
you
said
in
my
hearing
Yes
I
kept
hearing
these
words
9
I
am
pure
without
transgression
I
am
clean
without
error
10
But
God
finds
reasons
to
oppose
me
He
considers
me
his
enemy
11
He
puts
my
feet
in
stocks
He
scrutinizes
all
my
paths
12
But
you
are
not
right
in
saying
this
so
I
will
answer
you
God
is
far
greater
than
mortal
man
13
Why
do
you
complain
against
Him
Is
it
because
he
did
not
answer
all
your
words
14
For
God
speaks
once
and
a
second
time
But
no
one
pays
attention
15
In
a
dream
a
vision
of
the
night
When
deep
sleep
falls
upon
peopleWhile
they
sleep
in
their
beds
16
Then
he
uncovers
their
earsAnd
impresses
his
instruction
upon
them
17
To
turn
a
person
away
from
wrongdoingAnd
to
protect
a
man
from
pride
18
God
spares
his
soul
from
the
pit
His
life
from
perishing
by
the
sword
19
A
person
is
also
reproved
by
pain
on
his
bedAnd
by
the
constant
distress
of
his
bones
20
So
that
his
very
being
loathes
bread
And
he
rejects
even
fine
food
21
His
flesh
wastes
away
from
sight
And
his
bones
that
were
hidden
now
protrude
22
His
soul
draws
near
to
the
pit
His
life
to
those
who
bring
death
23
If
there
is
a
messenger
for
him
One
advocate
out
of
a
thousand
To
tell
to
man
what
is
upright
24
Then
God
shows
him
favor
and
says
Spare
him
from
going
down
into
the
pit
I
have
found
a
ransom
25
Let
his
flesh
become
fresher
than
in
youth
Let
him
return
to
the
days
of
his
youthful
vigor
26
He
will
entreat
God
who
will
accept
him
And
he
will
see
His
face
with
shouts
of
joy
And
He
will
restore
His
righteousness
to
mortal
man
27
That
person
will
declare
to
men
I
have
sinned
and
distorted
what
is
right
But
I
did
not
receive
what
I
deserved
28
He
has
redeemed
my
soul
from
going
into
the
pit
And
my
life
will
see
the
light
29
Indeed
God
does
all
these
thingsTwice
three
times
for
a
man
30
To
bring
him
back
from
the
pit
So
that
he
may
be
enlightened
with
the
light
of
life
31
Pay
attention
Job
Listen
to
me
Keep
silent
and
I
will
continue
speaking
32
If
you
have
something
to
say
reply
to
me
Speak
for
I
want
to
prove
you
right
33
If
you
have
nothing
to
say
you
should
listen
to
me
Keep
silent
and
I
will
teach
you
wisdom
1
So
Elihu
continued
to
say
in
reply

2
Listen
to
my
words
you
who
are
wise
Hear
me
you
who
know
so
much

3
For
the
ear
tests
wordsJust
as
the
tongue
tastes
food

4
Let
us
evaluate
for
ourselves
what
is
right
Let
us
decide
among
ourselves
what
is
good

5
For
Job
has
said
I
am
in
the
right
But
God
has
denied
me
justice

6
Would
I
lie
about
what
my
own
judgment
should
be
My
wound
is
incurable
though
there
is
no
transgression

7
What
other
man
is
like
Job
Who
drinks
up
derision
like
water

8
He
is
in
company
with
wrongdoersAnd
in
association
with
wicked
men

9
For
he
has
said
A
man
does
not
benefitFrom
trying
to
please
God
10
So
listen
to
me
you
men
of
understanding
It
is
unthinkable
for
the
true
God
to
act
wickedly
For
the
Almighty
to
do
wrong
11
For
he
will
reward
a
man
according
to
what
he
doesAnd
bring
upon
him
the
consequences
of
his
ways
12
For
a
certainty
God
does
not
act
wickedly
The
Almighty
does
not
pervert
justice
13
Who
put
him
in
charge
of
the
earth
And
who
appointed
him
over
the
whole
world
14
If
he
fixes
his
attention
on
them
If
he
gathers
their
spirit
and
breath
to
himself
15
All
humans
would
perish
together
And
mankind
would
return
to
the
dust
16
So
if
you
have
understanding
pay
attention
to
this
Listen
carefully
to
what
I
say
17
Should
someone
who
hates
justice
be
in
control
Or
would
you
condemn
a
powerful
one
who
is
righteous
18
Would
you
say
to
a
king
You
are
good
for
nothing

Or
to
nobles
You
are
wicked
19
There
is
One
who
does
not
show
partiality
to
princesAnd
who
does
not
favor
the
rich
over
the
poor
For
they
are
all
the
work
of
his
hands
20
They
may
die
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
night
They
shake
violently
and
pass
away
Even
the
powerful
are
removed
but
not
by
human
hands
21
For
Gods
eyes
are
upon
the
ways
of
a
man
And
He
sees
all
his
steps
22
There
is
no
darkness
or
deep
shadowWhere
wrongdoers
can
conceal
themselves
23
For
God
has
not
set
an
appointed
time
for
any
manTo
appear
before
him
in
judgment
24
He
breaks
the
powerful
without
needing
to
investigateAnd
sets
up
others
in
their
place
25
For
he
knows
what
they
are
doing
He
overthrows
them
during
the
night
and
they
are
crushed
26
He
strikes
them
for
their
wickedness
In
a
place
where
all
can
see
27
Because
they
have
turned
away
from
following
himAnd
have
no
regard
for
any
of
his
ways
28
They
cause
the
poor
to
cry
out
to
him
So
that
he
hears
the
outcry
of
the
helpless
29
When
God
remains
silent
who
can
condemn
him
When
he
hides
his
face
who
can
see
him
Whether
toward
a
nation
or
a
man
the
result
is
the
same
30
So
that
a
godless
person
may
not
ruleOr
lay
snares
for
the
people
31
For
will
anyone
say
to
God
I
have
been
punished
although
I
have
committed
no
offense
32
Teach
me
what
I
have
failed
to
see
If
I
have
done
anything
wrong
I
will
not
do
it
again
33
Should
he
reward
you
on
your
terms
when
you
reject
his
judgment
You
must
decide
not
I
So
tell
me
what
you
know
so
well
34
Men
of
understanding
will
say
to
me—Any
wise
man
who
hears
me—35
Job
speaks
without
knowledge
And
his
words
lack
insight
36
Let
Job
be
tested
to
the
limitBecause
his
replies
are
like
those
of
wicked
men
37
He
adds
rebellion
to
his
sin
He
scornfully
claps
his
hands
before
usAnd
multiplies
his
words
against
the
true
God
1
Elihu
continued
his
response

2
Are
you
so
convinced
that
you
are
right
that
you
would
say
I
am
more
righteous
than
God

3
For
you
say
What
does
it
matter
to
you
Am
I
better
off
than
if
I
had
sinned

4
I
will
reply
to
youAnd
to
your
companions
with
you

5
Look
up
to
heaven
and
see
Observe
the
clouds
which
are
high
above
you

6
If
you
sin
how
do
you
hurt
him
If
your
transgressions
multiply
what
do
you
do
to
him

7
If
you
are
righteous
what
do
you
give
him
What
does
he
receive
from
you

8
Your
wickedness
affects
only
a
human
like
yourself
And
your
righteousness
a
son
of
man

9
People
cry
out
when
under
great
oppression
They
cry
for
relief
from
the
domination
of
the
powerful
10
But
no
one
says
Where
is
God
my
Grand
Maker
The
one
causing
songs
to
be
sung
in
the
night
11
He
teaches
us
more
than
the
beasts
of
the
earth
And
he
makes
us
wiser
than
the
birds
of
the
heavens
12
People
cry
out
but
he
does
not
answer
Because
of
the
pride
of
the
wicked
13
Surely
God
does
not
hear
an
empty
cry
The
Almighty
does
not
pay
attention
to
it
14
How
much
less
then
when
you
complain
that
you
do
not
see
him
Your
legal
case
is
before
him
so
you
should
wait
anxiously
for
him
15
For
he
has
not
angrily
called
for
an
accounting
Nor
has
he
taken
note
of
your
extreme
rashness
16
Job
opens
his
mouth
wide
in
vain
He
multiplies
words
without
knowledge
1
Elihu
continued

2
Be
patient
with
me
a
little
longer
while
I
explain
For
I
still
have
words
to
speak
on
Gods
behalf

3
I
will
speak
comprehensively
about
what
I
know
And
I
will
ascribe
righteousness
to
my
Maker

4
Truly
my
words
are
not
false
The
One
perfect
in
knowledge
is
here
before
you

5
Indeed
God
is
mighty
and
rejects
no
one
He
is
great
in
his
power
of
understanding

6
He
will
not
preserve
the
lives
of
the
wicked
But
he
gives
justice
to
the
afflicted

7
He
does
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
righteous
He
enthrones
them
with
kings
and
they
are
exalted
forever

8
But
if
they
are
bound
in
shacklesAnd
caught
in
ropes
of
affliction
9
He
reveals
to
them
what
they
have
done
Their
transgressions
caused
by
their
pride
10
He
opens
their
ears
to
correctionAnd
tells
them
to
turn
away
from
wrongdoing
11
If
they
obey
and
serve
him
They
will
live
out
their
days
in
prosperity
And
their
years
will
be
pleasant
12
But
if
they
do
not
obey
they
will
perish
by
the
swordAnd
die
without
knowledge
13
The
godless
at
heart
will
harbor
resentment
They
do
not
cry
for
help
even
when
he
binds
them
14
They
die
while
still
young
Spending
their
life
among
male
temple
prostitutes
15
But
God
rescues
the
afflicted
during
their
affliction
He
opens
their
ear
when
they
are
oppressed
16
He
draws
you
away
from
the
brink
of
distressTo
a
broad
space
free
of
restriction
With
rich
food
on
your
table
as
consolation
17
Then
you
will
be
satisfied
with
the
judgment
on
the
wicked
When
judgment
is
rendered
and
justice
is
upheld
18
But
take
care
that
rage
does
not
lead
you
into
spitefulness
And
do
not
let
a
large
bribe
lead
you
astray
19
Would
your
cry
for
helpOr
any
of
your
strenuous
efforts
keep
you
from
distress
20
Do
not
long
for
the
night
When
people
vanish
from
their
place
21
Beware
that
you
do
not
turn
to
wrongdoing
Choosing
this
instead
of
affliction
22
Look
God
is
exalted
in
his
power
What
instructor
is
like
him
23
Who
has
directed
his
wayOr
said
to
him
What
you
have
done
is
wrong
24
Remember
to
magnify
his
activity
Of
which
men
have
sung
25
All
mankind
has
seen
it
Mortal
man
looks
on
from
a
distance
26
Yes
God
is
greater
than
we
can
know
The
number
of
his
years
is
beyond
comprehension
27
He
draws
up
the
drops
of
water
They
condense
into
rain
from
his
mist
28
Then
the
clouds
pour
it
down
They
shower
down
upon
mankind
29
Can
anyone
understand
the
layers
of
clouds
The
thundering
from
his
tent
30
See
how
he
spreads
his
lightning
over
itAnd
covers
the
depths
of
the
sea
31
By
these
he
sustains
the
peoples
He
gives
them
food
in
abundance
32
With
his
hands
he
covers
the
lightning
And
he
directs
it
against
its
target
33
His
thunder
tells
about
him
Even
the
livestock
tell
who
is
coming
1
At
this
my
heart
poundsAnd
leaps
from
its
place

2
Listen
carefully
to
the
rumbling
of
his
voiceAnd
the
thunder
that
comes
from
his
mouth

3
He
unleashes
it
under
the
entire
heavensAnd
sends
his
lightning
to
the
ends
of
the
earth

4
After
that
is
a
roaring
sound
He
thunders
with
a
majestic
voice
And
he
does
not
hold
it
back
when
his
voice
is
heard

5
God
thunders
with
his
voice
in
a
wonderful
way
He
does
great
things
that
are
beyond
our
understanding

6
For
he
says
to
the
snow
Fall
to
the
earth

And
to
the
downpour
of
rain
Pour
down
mightily

7
God
puts
a
stop
to
all
human
activitySo
that
every
mortal
man
will
know
His
work

8
The
wild
animals
go
into
their
densAnd
remain
in
their
lairs

9
The
storm
wind
blows
from
its
chamber
And
the
cold
comes
from
the
north
winds
10
By
the
breath
of
God
the
ice
is
produced
And
the
broad
waters
are
frozen
solid
11
Yes
he
weighs
down
the
clouds
with
moisture
He
scatters
his
lightning
in
the
clouds
12
They
swirl
around
where
he
directs
them
They
carry
out
whatever
he
commands
on
the
surface
of
the
inhabited
earth
13
Whether
it
is
for
punishment
or
for
the
sake
of
the
landOr
for
loyal
love
he
causes
it
to
happen
14
Listen
to
this
Job
Stop
and
consider
carefully
the
wonderful
works
of
God
15
Do
you
know
how
God
controls
the
cloudsAnd
how
he
causes
the
lightning
to
flash
from
his
cloud
16
Do
you
know
how
the
clouds
float
These
are
the
wonderful
works
of
the
One
perfect
in
knowledge
17
Why
does
your
clothing
become
hotWhen
the
earth
is
still
because
of
the
south
wind
18
Can
you
with
him
spread
out
the
skiesAs
solid
as
a
metal
mirror
19
Tell
us
what
we
should
say
to
him
We
cannot
answer
because
we
are
in
the
dark
20
Should
he
be
told
that
I
want
to
speak
Or
has
anyone
said
something
that
should
be
communicated
to
him
21
They
cannot
even
see
the
light
Though
it
is
bright
in
the
sky
Until
a
wind
passes
by
and
clears
away
the
clouds
22
Out
of
the
north
comes
golden
splendor
Gods
majesty
is
awe-inspiring
23
Understanding
the
Almighty
is
beyond
our
reach
He
is
great
in
power
And
he
never
violates
his
justice
and
abundant
righteousness
24
Therefore
people
should
fear
him
For
he
does
not
favor
any
who
think
that
they
are
wise
1
Then
Jehovah
answered
Job
out
of
the
windstorm

2
Who
is
this
who
is
obscuring
my
counselAnd
speaking
without
knowledge

3
Brace
yourself
please
like
a
man
I
will
question
you
and
you
inform
me

4
Where
were
you
when
I
founded
the
earth
Tell
me
if
you
think
you
understand

5
Who
set
its
measurements
in
case
you
know
Or
who
stretched
a
measuring
line
across
it

6
Into
what
were
its
pedestals
sunk
Or
who
laid
its
cornerstone
7
When
the
morning
stars
joyfully
cried
out
together
And
all
the
sons
of
God
began
shouting
in
applause

8
And
who
barricaded
the
sea
behind
doorsWhen
it
burst
out
from
the
womb
9
When
I
clothed
it
with
cloudsAnd
wrapped
it
in
thick
gloom
10
When
I
established
my
limit
for
itAnd
put
its
bars
and
doors
in
place
11
And
I
said
You
may
come
this
far
and
no
farther
Here
is
where
your
proud
waves
will
stop
12
Have
you
ever
commanded
the
morningOr
made
the
dawn
know
its
place
13
To
take
hold
of
the
ends
of
the
earthAnd
to
shake
the
wicked
out
of
it
14
It
is
transformed
like
clay
under
a
seal
And
its
features
stand
out
like
those
of
a
garment
15
But
the
light
of
the
wicked
is
held
back
from
them
And
their
uplifted
arm
is
broken
16
Have
you
gone
down
to
the
sources
of
the
seaOr
explored
the
deep
waters
17
Have
the
gates
of
death
been
revealed
to
you
Or
have
you
seen
the
gates
of
deep
darkness
18
Have
you
understood
the
vast
expanse
of
the
earth
Tell
me
if
you
know
all
of
this
19
In
which
direction
does
the
light
reside
And
where
is
the
place
of
darkness
20
That
you
should
take
it
to
its
territoryAnd
understand
the
paths
to
its
home
21
Do
you
know
this
because
you
were
already
bornAnd
the
number
of
your
years
is
great
22
Have
you
entered
the
storehouses
of
the
snow
Or
have
you
seen
the
storehouses
of
the
hail
23
Which
I
have
reserved
for
the
time
of
distress
For
the
day
of
battle
and
war
24
From
what
direction
is
light
dispersed
And
from
where
does
the
east
wind
blow
on
the
earth
25
Who
has
cut
a
channel
for
the
floodAnd
made
a
path
for
the
thunderous
storm
cloud
26
To
make
it
rain
where
no
man
lives
On
the
wilderness
where
there
are
no
humans
27
To
satisfy
devastated
wastelandsAnd
cause
the
grass
to
sprout
28
Does
the
rain
have
a
father
Or
who
fathered
the
dewdrops
29
From
whose
womb
did
the
ice
emerge
And
who
gave
birth
to
the
frost
of
heaven30
When
the
waters
are
covered
as
if
with
stone
And
the
surface
of
the
deep
waters
is
frozen
solid
31
Can
you
tie
the
ropes
of
the
Kimah
constellationOr
untie
the
cords
of
the
Kesil
constellation
32
Can
you
lead
out
a
constellation
in
its
seasonOr
guide
the
Ash
constellation
along
with
its
sons
33
Do
you
know
the
laws
governing
the
heavens
Or
can
you
impose
their
authority
on
the
earth
34
Can
you
raise
your
voice
to
the
cloudsTo
cause
a
flood
of
water
to
cover
you
35
Can
you
send
out
lightning
bolts
Will
they
come
and
say
to
you
Here
we
are
36
Who
put
wisdom
within
the
cloudsOr
gave
understanding
to
the
sky
phenomenon
37
Who
is
wise
enough
to
count
the
clouds
Or
who
can
tip
over
the
water
jars
of
heaven38
When
the
dust
pours
into
a
massAnd
the
clods
of
earth
stick
together
39
Can
you
hunt
prey
for
a
lionOr
satisfy
the
appetites
of
young
lions40
When
they
crouch
in
their
lairsOr
lie
in
ambush
in
their
dens
41
Who
prepares
food
for
the
ravenWhen
its
young
cry
to
God
for
helpAnd
wander
about
because
there
is
nothing
to
eat
1
Do
you
know
the
time
when
the
mountain
goats
give
birth
Have
you
watched
the
deer
give
birth
to
their
young

2
Do
you
count
the
months
that
they
must
complete
Do
you
know
the
time
when
they
give
birth

3
They
crouch
down
when
they
give
birth
to
their
young
And
their
labor
pains
end

4
Their
young
become
strong
and
grow
up
in
the
open
field
They
go
out
and
do
not
return
to
them

5
Who
set
the
wild
donkey
free
And
who
untied
the
ropes
of
the
wild
donkey

6
I
have
made
the
desert
plain
its
homeAnd
the
salt
land
its
dwelling

7
It
scorns
the
tumult
of
the
city
It
does
not
hear
the
shouts
of
the
driver

8
It
roams
the
hills
seeking
pasture
Looking
for
every
green
plant

9
Is
the
wild
bull
willing
to
serve
you
Will
it
spend
the
night
in
your
stable
10
Will
you
hold
a
wild
bull
to
the
furrow
with
a
rope
Or
will
it
follow
you
to
plow
the
valley
11
Will
you
trust
in
its
great
strengthAnd
let
it
do
your
heavy
work
12
Will
you
rely
on
it
to
bring
back
your
harvest
And
will
it
gather
it
to
your
threshing
floor
13
The
wings
of
the
ostrich
flap
joyfully
But
can
her
pinions
and
plumage
compare
with
the
storks
14
For
she
leaves
her
eggs
on
the
ground
And
she
keeps
them
warm
in
the
dust
15
She
forgets
that
some
foot
may
crush
themOr
that
a
wild
animal
may
trample
them
16
She
treats
her
sons
harshly
as
if
they
were
not
hers
She
has
no
fear
that
her
labor
may
be
in
vain
17
For
God
has
deprived
her
of
wisdomAnd
given
her
no
share
in
understanding
18
But
when
she
rises
up
and
flaps
her
wings
She
laughs
at
the
horse
and
at
its
rider
19
Are
you
the
one
who
gives
the
horse
its
strength
Do
you
clothe
its
neck
with
a
rustling
mane
20
Can
you
cause
it
to
leap
like
a
locust
Its
majestic
snorting
is
terrifying
21
It
paws
the
ground
in
the
valley
and
exults
mightily
It
charges
into
the
battle
22
It
laughs
at
fear
and
is
afraid
of
nothing
It
does
not
turn
back
because
of
the
sword
23
The
quiver
rattles
against
it
The
spear
and
the
javelin
flash
24
Trembling
with
excitement
it
surges
forward
It
cannot
stand
still
at
the
sound
of
the
horn
25
When
the
horn
blows
it
says
Aha
It
smells
the
battle
from
afarAnd
hears
the
shouting
of
commanders
and
the
battle
cry
26
Is
it
by
your
understanding
that
the
falcon
soars
Spreading
its
wings
to
the
south
27
Or
is
it
at
your
order
that
an
eagle
flies
upwardAnd
builds
its
nest
high
up
28
Spending
the
night
on
a
cliff
Dwelling
in
its
stronghold
on
a
rocky
crag
29
From
there
it
searches
for
food
Its
eyes
look
far
into
the
distance
30
Its
young
sip
up
blood
And
wherever
the
slain
are
there
it
is
1
Jehovah
continued
to
answer
Job

2
Should
a
faultfinder
contend
with
the
Almighty
Let
the
one
who
wants
to
reprove
God
answer

3
Job
said
in
answer
to
Jehovah

4
Look
I
am
unworthy
What
can
I
reply
to
you
I
put
my
hand
over
my
mouth

5
I
spoke
once
but
I
will
not
answer
again
Twice
but
I
will
say
no
more

6
Then
Jehovah
answered
Job
out
of
the
windstorm

7
Brace
yourself
please
like
a
man
I
will
question
you
and
you
inform
me

8
Will
you
call
into
question
my
justice
Will
you
condemn
me
so
that
you
may
be
right

9
Do
you
have
an
arm
as
powerful
as
the
true
Gods
Or
can
your
voice
thunder
like
his
10
Adorn
yourself
please
with
glory
and
majesty
Clothe
yourself
with
dignity
and
splendor
11
Release
the
fury
of
your
anger
Look
at
everyone
who
is
haughty
and
bring
him
low
12
Look
at
everyone
who
is
haughty
and
humble
him
And
tread
down
the
wicked
where
they
stand
13
Hide
them
all
in
the
dust
Bind
them
in
the
hidden
place
14
Then
even
I
would
acknowledge
to
youThat
your
right
hand
can
save
you
15
Here
now
is
Behemoth
which
I
made
as
I
made
you
It
eats
grass
like
a
bull
16
Look
at
the
strength
in
its
hipsAnd
the
power
in
the
muscles
of
its
belly
17
It
stiffens
its
tail
like
a
cedar
The
sinews
of
its
thighs
are
woven
together
18
Its
bones
are
tubes
of
copper
Its
limbs
are
like
wrought-iron
rods
19
It
ranks
first
among
the
works
of
God
Only
its
Maker
can
approach
it
with
his
sword
20
For
the
mountains
produce
food
for
it
Where
all
the
wild
animals
play
21
It
lies
down
under
the
lotus
trees
In
the
shelter
of
the
reeds
of
the
marsh
22
The
lotus
trees
cast
their
shadow
on
it
And
the
poplars
of
the
valley
surround
it
23
If
the
river
is
turbulent
it
does
not
panic
It
is
confident
although
the
Jordan
rushes
against
its
mouth
24
Can
anyone
capture
it
while
it
is
watching
Or
pierce
its
nose
with
a
hook
1
Can
you
catch
Leviathan
with
a
fishhookOr
hold
down
its
tongue
with
a
rope

2
Can
you
put
a
rope
through
its
nostrilsOr
pierce
its
jaws
with
a
hook

3
Will
it
make
many
pleas
to
you
Or
will
it
speak
gently
to
you

4
Will
it
make
a
covenant
with
you
So
that
you
may
make
it
your
slave
for
life

5
Will
you
play
with
it
as
with
a
birdOr
tie
it
on
a
leash
for
your
little
girls

6
Will
traders
barter
for
it
Will
they
divide
it
up
among
merchants

7
Will
you
fill
its
hide
with
harpoonsOr
its
head
with
fishing
spears

8
Lay
your
hand
on
it
You
will
remember
the
battle
and
never
do
it
again

9
Any
hope
of
subduing
it
is
futile
The
mere
sight
of
it
would
overwhelm
you
10
No
one
dares
to
stir
it
up
So
who
is
it
who
can
stand
up
to
me
11
Who
has
given
me
anything
first
that
I
should
repay
him
Whatever
is
under
the
heavens
is
mine
12
I
will
not
be
silent
about
its
limbs
About
its
mightiness
and
its
well-formed
body
13
Who
has
removed
its
outer
covering
Who
will
enter
its
open
jaws
14
Who
can
pry
open
the
doors
of
its
mouth
Its
teeth
all
around
are
fearsome
15
Its
back
has
rows
of
scalesTightly
sealed
together
16
Each
one
fits
so
closely
to
the
otherThat
no
air
can
come
between
them
17
They
are
stuck
to
one
another
They
cling
together
and
cannot
be
separated
18
Its
snorting
flashes
out
light
And
its
eyes
are
like
the
rays
of
dawn
19
Flashes
of
lightning
go
out
of
its
mouth
Fiery
sparks
escape
20
Smoke
pours
out
of
its
nostrils
Like
a
furnace
fueled
with
rushes
21
Its
breath
sets
coals
ablaze
And
a
flame
shoots
from
its
mouth
22
There
is
great
strength
in
its
neck
And
dismay
runs
before
it
23
The
folds
of
its
flesh
are
tightly
joined
together
They
are
firm
as
though
cast
upon
it
and
immovable
24
Its
heart
is
hard
as
stone
Yes
hard
as
a
lower
millstone
25
When
it
rises
up
even
the
mighty
are
frightened
Its
thrashing
causes
bewilderment
26
No
sword
that
reaches
it
will
prevail
Nor
will
spear
dart
or
arrowhead
27
It
regards
iron
as
straw
Copper
as
rotten
wood
28
An
arrow
does
not
make
it
flee
Slingstones
turn
into
stubble
against
it
29
It
regards
a
club
as
stubble
And
it
laughs
at
the
rattling
of
a
javelin
30
Underneath
it
is
like
sharp
fragments
of
pottery
It
spreads
itself
in
the
mud
like
a
threshing
sledge
31
It
makes
the
deep
boil
just
like
a
pot
It
stirs
up
the
sea
like
an
ointment
pot
32
It
leaves
a
glistening
wake
in
its
path
One
would
think
that
the
deep
had
white
hair
33
There
is
nothing
like
it
on
the
earth
A
creature
made
to
have
no
fear
34
It
glares
at
everything
that
is
haughty
It
is
king
over
all
the
majestic
wild
beasts
1
Then
Job
said
in
reply
to
Jehovah

2
Now
I
know
that
you
are
able
to
do
all
thingsAnd
that
nothing
you
have
in
mind
to
do
is
impossible
for
you

3
You
said
Who
is
this
who
is
obscuring
my
counsel
without
knowledge
Therefore
I
spoke
but
without
understandingAbout
things
too
wonderful
for
me
which
I
do
not
know

4
You
said
Please
listen
and
I
will
speak
I
will
question
you
and
you
inform
me

5
My
ears
have
heard
about
you
But
now
I
do
see
you
with
my
eyes

6
That
is
why
I
take
back
what
I
said
And
I
repent
in
dust
and
ashes
7
After
Jehovah
had
spoken
these
words
to
Job
Jehovah
said
to
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
My
anger
burns
against
you
and
your
two
companions
for
you
have
not
spoken
the
truth
about
me
as
my
servant
Job
has
8
Now
take
seven
bulls
and
seven
rams
and
go
to
my
servant
Job
and
offer
up
a
burnt
sacrifice
for
yourselves
And
my
servant
Job
will
pray
for
you
I
will
surely
accept
his
request
not
to
deal
with
you
according
to
your
foolishness
for
you
have
not
spoken
the
truth
about
me
as
my
servant
Job
has
9
So
Eliphaz
the
Temanite
Bildad
the
Shuhite
and
Zophar
the
Naamathite
went
and
did
what
Jehovah
had
told
them
to
do
And
Jehovah
accepted
Jobs
prayer
10
After
Job
had
prayed
for
his
companions
Jehovah
removed
Jobs
tribulation
and
restored
his
prosperity
Jehovah
gave
him
double
what
he
had
before
11
All
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
all
his
former
friends
came
to
him
and
ate
a
meal
with
him
in
his
house
They
sympathized
with
him
and
comforted
him
over
all
the
calamity
that
Jehovah
had
allowed
to
come
upon
him
Each
of
them
gave
him
a
piece
of
money
and
a
gold
ring
12
So
Jehovah
blessed
the
last
part
of
Jobs
life
more
than
the
beginning
and
Job
came
to
have
14000
sheep
6000
camels
1000
pairs
of
cattle
and
1000
female
donkeys
13
He
also
came
to
have
seven
more
sons
and
three
more
daughters
14
He
named
the
first
daughter
Jemimah
the
second
Keziah
and
the
third
Keren-happuch
15
No
women
in
all
the
land
were
as
beautiful
as
Jobs
daughters
and
their
father
gave
them
an
inheritance
along
with
their
brothers
16
After
this
Job
lived
for
140
years
and
he
saw
his
children
and
his
grandchildren—four
generations
17
Finally
Job
died
after
a
long
and
satisfying
life
1
Happy
is
the
man
who
does
not
walk
according
to
the
advice
of
the
wickedAnd
does
not
stand
on
the
path
of
sinnersAnd
does
not
sit
in
the
seat
of
scoffers

2
But
his
delight
is
in
the
law
of
Jehovah
And
he
reads
His
law
in
an
undertone
day
and
night

3
He
will
be
like
a
tree
planted
by
streams
of
water
A
tree
that
produces
fruit
in
its
season
The
foliage
of
which
does
not
wither
And
everything
he
does
will
succeed

4
The
wicked
are
not
like
that
They
are
like
the
chaff
that
the
wind
blows
away

5
That
is
why
the
wicked
will
not
remain
standing
in
the
judgment
Nor
will
sinners
remain
standing
in
the
assembly
of
the
righteous

6
For
Jehovah
is
aware
of
the
way
of
the
righteous
But
the
way
of
the
wicked
will
perish
1
Why
are
the
nations
agitatedAnd
the
peoples
muttering
an
empty
thing

2
The
kings
of
the
earth
take
their
standAnd
high
officials
gather
together
as
oneAgainst
Jehovah
and
against
his
anointed
one

3
They
say
Let
us
tear
off
their
shacklesAnd
throw
off
their
ropes

4
The
One
enthroned
in
the
heavens
will
laugh
Jehovah
will
scoff
at
them

5
At
that
time
he
will
speak
to
them
in
his
angerAnd
terrify
them
in
his
burning
anger
6
Saying
I
myself
have
installed
my
kingOn
Zion
my
holy
mountain

7
Let
me
proclaim
the
decree
of
Jehovah
He
said
to
me
You
are
my
son
Today
I
have
become
your
father

8
Ask
of
me
and
I
will
give
nations
as
your
inheritanceAnd
the
ends
of
the
earth
as
your
possession

9
You
will
break
them
with
an
iron
scepter
And
you
will
smash
them
like
a
piece
of
pottery
10
So
now
you
kings
show
insight
Accept
correction
you
judges
of
the
earth
11
Serve
Jehovah
with
fear
And
rejoice
with
trembling
12
Honor
the
son
or
God
will
become
indignantAnd
you
will
perish
from
the
way
For
His
anger
flares
up
quickly
Happy
are
all
those
taking
refuge
in
Him
A
melody
of
David
when
he
was
fleeing
from
his
son
Absalom
3
O
Jehovah
why
have
my
adversaries
become
so
numerous
Why
are
so
many
rising
up
against
me

2
Many
are
saying
about
me
God
will
not
save
him
Selah

3
But
you
O
Jehovah
are
a
shield
around
me
My
glory
and
the
One
who
lifts
up
my
head

4
I
will
call
aloud
to
Jehovah
And
he
will
answer
me
from
his
holy
mountain
Selah

5
I
will
lie
down
and
sleep
And
I
will
wake
up
in
safety
For
Jehovah
continues
to
support
me

6
I
am
not
afraid
of
the
tens
of
thousandsLined
up
against
me
on
every
side

7
Rise
up
O
Jehovah
Save
me
O
my
God
For
you
will
strike
all
my
enemies
on
the
jaw
You
will
break
the
teeth
of
the
wicked

8
Salvation
belongs
to
Jehovah
Your
blessing
is
upon
your
people
Selah
To
the
director

instruments
A

4
When
I
call
answer
me
O
my
righteous
God
Make
a
way
of
escape
for
me
in
my
distress
Show
me
favor
and
hear
my
prayer

2
You
sons
of
men
how
long
will
you
turn
my
honor
into
humiliation
How
long
will
you
love
what
is
worthless
and
search
for
what
is
false
Selah

3
Know
that
Jehovah
will
treat
his
loyal
one
in
a
special
way
Jehovah
will
hear
when
I
call
to
him

4
Be
agitated
but
do
not
sin
Have
your
say
in
your
heart
upon
your
bed
and
keep
silent
Selah

5
Offer
the
sacrifices
of
righteousness
And
trust
in
Jehovah

6
There
are
many
saying
Who
will
show
us
anything
good
Let
the
light
of
your
face
shine
upon
us
O
Jehovah

7
You
have
filled
my
heart
with
greater
rejoicingThan
those
who
have
an
abundant
harvest
of
grain
and
new
wine

8
I
will
lie
down
and
sleep
in
peace
For
you
alone
O
Jehovah
make
me
dwell
in
security
To
the
director
for
Nehiloth
A
melody
of
David
5
Listen
to
my
words
O
Jehovah
Be
attentive
to
my
sighing

2
Pay
attention
to
my
cry
for
help
O
my
King
and
my
God
because
to
you
I
pray

3
O
Jehovah
you
will
hear
my
voice
in
the
morning
In
the
morning
I
will
express
my
concern
to
you
and
wait
expectantly

4
For
you
are
not
a
God
who
takes
pleasure
in
wickedness
No
one
bad
may
remain
with
you

5
No
arrogant
person
may
stand
in
your
presence
You
hate
all
those
who
behave
wickedly
6
You
will
destroy
those
who
speak
lies
Jehovah
detests
violent
and
deceptive
people

7
But
I
will
come
into
your
house
because
of
your
great
loyal
love
I
will
bow
down
toward
your
holy
temple
in
reverential
fear
of
you

8
Lead
me
O
Jehovah
in
your
righteousness
because
of
my
foes
Make
your
way
clear
for
me

9
For
nothing
they
say
can
be
trusted
Within
them
is
nothing
but
malice
Their
throat
is
an
open
grave
They
flatter
with
their
tongue
10
But
God
will
declare
them
guilty
Their
own
schemes
will
cause
their
downfall
May
they
be
driven
away
because
of
their
many
transgressions
For
they
have
rebelled
against
you
11
But
all
those
who
take
refuge
in
you
will
rejoice
They
will
always
shout
joyfully
You
will
block
approach
to
them
And
those
loving
your
name
will
rejoice
in
you
12
For
you
will
bless
anyone
righteous
O
Jehovah
You
will
surround
them
with
approval
as
with
a
large
shield
To
the
director
to
be
accompanied
with
stringed
instruments
tuned

Sheminith
A

David
6
O
Jehovah
do
not
reprove
me
in
your
anger
And
do
not
correct
me
in
your
rage

2
Show
me
favor
O
Jehovah
for
I
am
growing
weak
Heal
me
O
Jehovah
for
my
bones
are
shaking

3
Yes
I
am
greatly
disturbed
And
I
ask
you
O
Jehovah—how
long
will
it
be

4
Return
O
Jehovah
and
rescue
me
Save
me
for
the
sake
of
your
loyal
love

5
For
in
death
there
is
no
mention
of
you
In
the
Grave
who
will
praise
you

6
I
have
grown
weary
with
my
sighing
All
night
long
I
soak
my
bed
with
tears
I
flood
my
couch
with
weeping

7
My
eye
is
weak
from
my
grief
It
has
dimmed
because
of
all
those
harassing
me

8
Get
away
from
me
all
you
who
behave
wickedly
For
Jehovah
will
hear
the
sound
of
my
weeping

9
Jehovah
will
hear
my
request
for
favor
Jehovah
will
accept
my
prayer
10
All
my
enemies
will
be
put
to
shame
and
dismayed
They
will
fall
back
in
sudden
disgrace
A
dirge
of
David
that
he
sang
to
Jehovah
regarding
the
words
of
Cush
the
Benjaminite
7
O
Jehovah
my
God
in
you
I
have
taken
refuge
Save
me
from
all
those
persecuting
me
and
rescue
me

2
Otherwise
they
will
tear
me
to
pieces
as
a
lion
does
Carrying
me
off
with
no
one
to
rescue
me

3
O
Jehovah
my
God
if
I
am
at
fault
in
this
If
I
have
acted
unjustly
4
If
I
have
wronged
the
one
doing
good
to
me
Or
if
I
have
plundered
my
enemy
without
cause
5
Then
let
an
enemy
pursue
and
overtake
me
Let
him
trample
my
life
down
to
the
earthAnd
cause
my
glory
to
perish
in
the
dust
Selah

6
Rise
up
in
your
anger
O
Jehovah
Stand
up
against
the
fury
of
my
enemies
Awake
for
me
and
demand
that
justice
be
done

7
Let
the
nations
surround
you
And
you
will
act
against
them
from
on
high

8
Jehovah
will
pass
sentence
on
the
peoples
Judge
me
O
Jehovah
according
to
my
righteousnessAnd
according
to
my
integrity

9
Please
put
an
end
to
the
evil
deeds
of
the
wicked
But
establish
the
righteous
Since
you
are
the
righteous
God
who
examines
the
hearts
and
the
deepest
emotions
10
God
is
my
shield
the
Savior
of
those
upright
in
heart
11
God
is
a
righteous
Judge
And
God
proclaims
his
judgments
every
day
12
If
anyone
will
not
repent
He
sharpens
his
sword
He
bends
his
bow
and
makes
it
ready
13
He
prepares
his
deadly
weapons
He
makes
ready
his
flaming
arrows
14
Look
at
the
one
who
is
pregnant
with
wickedness
He
conceives
trouble
and
gives
birth
to
lies
15
He
excavates
a
pit
and
digs
it
deep
But
he
falls
into
the
very
hole
he
made
16
The
trouble
he
causes
will
return
on
his
own
head
His
violence
will
fall
on
the
crown
of
his
head
17
I
will
praise
Jehovah
for
his
justice
I
will
sing
praises
to
the
name
of
Jehovah
the
Most
High
To
the
director
upon
the
Gittith
A
melody
of
David
8
O
Jehovah
our
Lord
how
majestic
your
name
is
throughout
the
earth
You
have
set
your
splendor
even
higher
than
the
heavens

2
Out
of
the
mouth
of
children
and
infants
you
have
established
strengthOn
account
of
your
adversaries
To
silence
the
enemy
and
the
avenger

3
When
I
see
your
heavens
the
works
of
your
fingers
The
moon
and
the
stars
that
you
have
prepared
4
What
is
mortal
man
that
you
keep
him
in
mind
And
a
son
of
man
that
you
take
care
of
him

5
You
made
him
a
little
lower
than
godlike
ones
And
you
crowned
him
with
glory
and
splendor

6
You
gave
him
dominion
over
the
works
of
your
hands
You
have
put
everything
under
his
feet

7
All
the
flocks
and
cattle
As
well
as
the
wild
animals
8
The
birds
of
the
heavens
and
the
fish
of
the
sea
Whatever
passes
through
the
paths
of
the
seas

O
Jehovah
our
Lord
how
majestic
your
name
is
throughout
the
earth
To
the
director
upon
Muth-labben
A
melody

9
I
will
praise
you
O
Jehovah
with
all
my
heart
I
will
tell
about
all
your
wonderful
works

2
I
will
rejoice
and
exult
in
you
I
will
sing
praises
to
your
name
O
Most
High

3
When
my
enemies
retreat
They
will
stumble
and
perish
from
before
you

4
For
you
defend
my
just
cause
You
sit
on
your
throne
judging
with
righteousness

5
You
have
rebuked
nations
and
destroyed
the
wicked
Blotting
out
their
name
forever
and
ever

6
The
enemy
has
been
ruined
forever
You
uprooted
their
cities
And
all
memory
of
them
will
perish

7
But
Jehovah
is
enthroned
forever
He
has
firmly
established
his
throne
for
justice

8
He
will
judge
the
inhabited
earth
in
righteousness
He
will
render
righteous
legal
decisions
for
the
nations

9
Jehovah
will
become
a
secure
refuge
for
the
oppressed
A
secure
refuge
in
times
of
distress
10
Those
knowing
your
name
will
trust
in
you
You
will
never
abandon
those
seeking
you
O
Jehovah
11
Sing
praises
to
Jehovah
who
is
dwelling
in
Zion
Make
his
deeds
known
among
the
peoples
12
For
the
One
who
avenges
their
blood
remembers
them
He
will
not
forget
the
cry
of
the
afflicted
13
Show
me
favor
O
Jehovah
see
my
affliction
by
those
hating
me
You
who
raise
me
from
the
gates
of
death
14
So
that
I
may
declare
your
praiseworthy
deeds
in
the
gates
of
the
daughter
of
Zion
And
rejoice
in
your
acts
of
salvation
15
The
nations
have
sunk
down
into
the
pit
they
made
Their
own
foot
has
been
caught
in
the
net
they
hid
16
Jehovah
is
known
by
the
judgment
he
executes
The
wicked
one
has
been
ensnared
in
the
work
of
his
own
hands
Higgaion
Selah
17
The
wicked
will
retreat
toward
the
Grave
All
the
nations
who
forget
God
18
But
the
poor
will
not
always
be
forgotten
Nor
will
the
hope
of
the
meek
ever
perish
19
Rise
up
O
Jehovah
Do
not
let
mortal
man
prevail
May
the
nations
be
judged
in
your
presence
20
Strike
them
with
fear
O
Jehovah
Let
the
nations
know
that
they
are
only
mortal
men
Selah
1
Why
O
Jehovah
do
you
stand
at
a
distance
Why
do
you
hide
yourself
in
times
of
distress

2
The
wicked
one
arrogantly
pursues
the
helpless
one
But
he
will
be
caught
in
the
schemes
he
devises

3
For
the
wicked
one
boasts
about
his
selfish
desiresAnd
blesses
the
greedy
one
He
disrespects
Jehovah

4
In
his
haughtiness
the
wicked
man
makes
no
investigation
All
his
thoughts
are
There
is
no
God

5
His
ways
keep
prospering
But
your
judgments
are
beyond
his
understanding
He
scoffs
at
all
his
adversaries

6
He
says
in
his
heart
I
will
never
be
shaken
For
generation
after
generationI
will
never
see
calamity

7
His
mouth
is
full
of
curses
lies
and
threats
Under
his
tongue
are
trouble
and
injury

8
He
waits
in
ambush
near
the
settlements
From
his
hiding
place
he
kills
an
innocent
one
His
eyes
are
watching
for
an
unfortunate
victim

9
He
waits
in
his
hiding
place
like
a
lion
in
its
lair
He
waits
to
seize
the
helpless
one
He
seizes
the
helpless
one
when
he
pulls
his
net
shut
10
The
victim
is
crushed
and
brought
down
The
unfortunate
ones
fall
into
his
clutches
11
He
says
in
his
heart
God
has
forgotten
He
has
turned
away
his
face
He
never
notices
12
Rise
up
O
Jehovah
O
God
lift
up
your
hand
Do
not
forget
the
helpless
ones
13
Why
has
the
wicked
one
disrespected
God
He
says
in
his
heart
You
will
not
hold
me
accountable
14
But
you
do
see
trouble
and
distress
You
look
on
and
take
matters
in
hand
To
you
the
unfortunate
victim
turns
You
are
the
helper
for
the
fatherless
child
15
Break
the
arm
of
the
wicked
and
evil
man
So
that
when
you
search
for
his
wickedness
You
will
find
it
no
more
16
Jehovah
is
King
forever
and
ever
The
nations
have
perished
from
the
earth
17
But
you
will
hear
the
request
of
the
meek
O
Jehovah
You
will
make
their
hearts
firm
and
pay
close
attention
to
them
18
You
will
render
justice
to
the
fatherless
and
to
those
who
are
crushed
So
that
mortal
man
of
the
earth
may
no
longer
make
them
afraid
To
the
director
Of
David
11
In
Jehovah
I
have
taken
refuge
So
how
can
you
say
to
me
Flee
like
a
bird
to
your
mountain

2
See
how
the
wicked
bend
the
bow
They
set
their
arrow
on
the
bowstring
To
shoot
from
the
darkness
those
upright
in
heart

3
When
the
foundations
are
torn
down
What
can
the
righteous
do

4
Jehovah
is
in
his
holy
temple
Jehovahs
throne
is
in
the
heavens
His
own
eyes
see
his
watchful
eyes
examine
the
sons
of
men

5
Jehovah
examines
the
righteous
one
as
well
as
the
wicked
one
He
hates
anyone
who
loves
violence

6
Upon
the
wicked
he
will
rain
down
snares
Fire
and
sulfur
and
a
scorching
wind
will
be
the
portion
of
their
cup

7
For
Jehovah
is
righteous
he
loves
righteous
acts
The
upright
will
see
his
face
To
the
director
tuned
to
Sheminith
A
melody
of
David
12
Save
me
O
Jehovah
for
the
loyal
one
is
no
more
Faithful
people
have
vanished
from
among
men

2
They
speak
lies
to
one
another
They
flatter
with
their
lips
and
speak
with
deceitful
hearts

3
Jehovah
will
cut
off
all
flattering
lipsAnd
the
tongue
that
makes
great
boasts
4
Those
who
say
We
will
prevail
with
our
tongues
We
use
our
lips
as
we
please
Who
will
be
our
master

5
Because
the
afflicted
are
oppressed
Because
of
the
sighing
of
the
poor
I
will
rise
up
to
act

says
Jehovah
I
will
save
them
from
those
who
treat
them
with
contempt

6
The
sayings
of
Jehovah
are
pure
They
are
like
silver
refined
in
an
earthen
furnace
purified
seven
times

7
You
will
guard
them
O
Jehovah
You
will
protect
each
one
of
them
from
this
generation
forever

8
The
wicked
walk
around
unrestrainedBecause
the
sons
of
men
promote
depravity
To
the
director
A
melody
of
David
13
How
long
O
Jehovah
will
you
forget
me
Forever
How
long
will
you
hide
your
face
from
me

2
How
long
will
I
have
anxious
concern
With
grief
in
my
heart
each
day
How
long
will
my
enemy
triumph
over
me

3
Look
upon
me
and
answer
me
O
Jehovah
my
God
Give
light
to
my
eyes
so
that
I
may
not
fall
asleep
in
death
4
So
that
my
enemy
will
not
say
I
have
defeated
him
Do
not
let
my
opponents
rejoice
over
my
downfall

5
As
for
me
I
trust
in
your
loyal
love
My
heart
will
rejoice
in
your
acts
of
salvation

6
I
will
sing
to
Jehovah
for
he
has
richly
rewarded
me
To
the
director
Of
David
14
The
foolish
one
says
in
his
heart
There
is
no
Jehovah
Their
actions
are
corrupt
and
their
dealings
are
detestable
No
one
is
doing
good

2
But
Jehovah
looks
down
from
heaven
on
the
sons
of
menTo
see
whether
anyone
has
insight
whether
anyone
is
seeking
Jehovah

3
They
have
all
turned
aside
They
are
all
alike
corrupt
No
one
is
doing
good
Not
even
one

4
Do
none
of
the
wrongdoers
understand
They
devour
my
people
as
if
they
were
eating
bread
They
do
not
call
on
Jehovah

5
But
they
will
be
filled
with
great
terror
For
Jehovah
is
with
the
generation
of
the
righteous

6
You
wrongdoers
try
to
frustrate
the
plans
of
the
lowly
one
But
Jehovah
is
his
refuge

7
O
that
Israels
salvation
may
come
from
Zion
When
Jehovah
gathers
back
his
captive
people
Let
Jacob
be
joyful
let
Israel
rejoice
A
melody
of
David
15
O
Jehovah
who
may
be
a
guest
in
your
tent
Who
may
reside
in
your
holy
mountain

2
The
one
who
is
walking
faultlessly
Practicing
what
is
rightAnd
speaking
the
truth
in
his
heart

3
He
does
not
slander
with
his
tongue
He
does
nothing
bad
to
his
neighbor
And
he
does
not
defame
his
friends

4
He
rejects
anyone
who
is
contemptible
But
he
honors
those
fearing
Jehovah
He
does
not
go
back
on
his
promise
even
when
it
is
bad
for
him

5
He
does
not
lend
his
money
on
interest
And
he
does
not
accept
a
bribe
against
the
innocent
Whoever
does
these
things
will
never
be
shaken
A
miktam
of
David
16
Protect
me
O
God
for
I
have
taken
refuge
in
you

2
I
have
said
to
Jehovah
You
are
Jehovah
my
Source
of
goodness

3
And
the
holy
ones
in
the
earth
The
majestic
ones
bring
me
great
delight

4
Those
who
pursue
other
gods
multiply
their
sorrows
I
will
never
pour
out
their
drink
offerings
of
blood
Nor
will
my
lips
mention
their
names

5
Jehovah
is
my
portion
my
allotted
share
and
my
cup
You
safeguard
my
inheritance

6
Pleasant
places
have
been
measured
out
to
me
Yes
I
am
content
with
my
inheritance

7
I
will
praise
Jehovah
who
has
given
me
advice
Even
during
the
night
my
innermost
thoughts
correct
me

8
I
keep
Jehovah
before
me
constantly
Because
he
is
at
my
right
hand
I
will
never
be
shaken

9
So
my
heart
rejoices
my
whole
being
is
joyful
And
I
reside
in
security
10
For
you
will
not
leave
me
in
the
Grave
You
will
not
allow
your
loyal
one
to
see
the
pit
11
You
make
known
to
me
the
path
of
life
In
your
presence
is
abundant
joy
There
is
happiness
at
your
right
hand
forever
A
prayer
of
David
17
Hear
my
plea
for
justice
O
Jehovah
Pay
attention
to
my
cry
for
help
Listen
to
my
prayer
spoken
without
deceit

2
May
you
make
a
just
decision
in
my
behalf
May
your
eyes
see
what
is
right

3
You
have
examined
my
heart
you
have
inspected
me
by
night
You
have
refined
me
You
will
find
that
I
have
not
schemed
anything
bad
And
my
mouth
has
not
transgressed

4
As
for
the
activities
of
men
In
accord
with
the
word
of
your
lips
I
avoid
the
paths
of
the
robber

5
Let
my
steps
stay
on
your
tracksSo
that
my
feet
will
not
stumble

6
I
do
call
on
you
because
you
will
answer
me
O
God
Incline
your
ear
to
me
Hear
my
words

7
Show
your
loyal
love
in
a
wonderful
way
O
Savior
of
those
seeking
refuge
at
your
right
handFrom
those
who
rebel
against
you

8
Guard
me
like
the
pupil
of
your
eye
Conceal
me
in
the
shadow
of
your
wings

9
Guard
me
from
the
wicked
who
attack
me
From
my
mortal
enemies
who
surround
me
10
They
have
become
insensitive
With
their
mouth
they
speak
arrogantly
11
Now
they
hem
us
in
They
watch
for
the
chance
to
cause
our
downfall
12
He
is
like
a
lion
eager
to
tear
its
prey
to
pieces
Like
a
young
lion
crouching
in
ambush
13
Rise
up
O
Jehovah
to
confront
him
and
bring
him
down
Rescue
me
from
the
wicked
with
your
sword
14
Rescue
me
with
your
hand
O
Jehovah
From
men
of
this
world
whose
share
is
in
this
life
Those
whom
you
fill
with
the
good
things
you
provideAnd
who
leave
an
inheritance
to
their
many
sons
15
But
as
for
me
in
righteousness
I
will
see
your
face
I
am
satisfied
to
awaken
in
your
presence
To
the
director
By
Jehovahs
servant
David
who
addressed
the
words
of
this
song
to
Jehovah
in
the
day
that
Jehovah
rescued
him
from
the
hand
of
all
his
enemies
and
from
the
hand
of
Saul
He
said
18
I
have
affection
for
you
O
Jehovah
my
strength

2
Jehovah
is
my
crag
and
my
stronghold
and
the
One
who
rescues
me
My
God
is
my
rock
in
whom
I
take
refuge
My
shield
and
my
horn
of
salvation
my
secure
refuge

3
I
call
on
Jehovah
who
is
worthy
of
praise
And
I
will
be
saved
from
my
enemies

4
The
ropes
of
death
encircled
me
Flash
floods
of
worthless
men
terrified
me

5
The
ropes
of
the
Grave
surrounded
me
The
snares
of
death
confronted
me

6
In
my
distress
I
called
on
Jehovah
To
my
God
I
kept
crying
for
help
From
his
temple
he
heard
my
voice
And
my
cry
to
him
for
help
reached
his
ears

7
Then
the
earth
began
to
shake
and
rock
The
foundations
of
the
mountains
trembledAnd
shook
back
and
forth
because
he
had
been
angered

8
Smoke
ascended
from
his
nostrils
And
a
consuming
fire
came
from
his
mouth
Glowing
coals
blazed
from
him

9
He
made
the
heavens
bend
as
he
descended
And
thick
gloom
was
beneath
his
feet
10
He
rode
on
a
cherub
and
came
flying
He
swooped
down
on
the
wings
of
a
spirit
11
He
then
covered
himself
in
darkness
All
around
him
as
a
shelter
Dark
waters
and
thick
clouds
12
From
the
brightness
before
himHail
and
fiery
coals
broke
through
the
clouds
13
Then
Jehovah
began
to
thunder
in
the
heavens
The
Most
High
made
his
voice
heardWith
hailstones
and
fiery
coals
14
He
shot
his
arrows
and
scattered
them
He
hurled
his
lightning
and
threw
them
into
confusion
15
The
streambeds
became
visible
The
foundations
of
the
land
were
exposed
by
your
rebuke
O
Jehovah
By
the
blast
of
the
breath
from
your
nostrils
16
He
reached
down
from
on
high
He
took
hold
of
me
and
pulled
me
from
deep
waters
17
He
rescued
me
from
my
strong
enemy
From
those
hating
me
who
were
stronger
than
I
was
18
They
confronted
me
on
the
day
of
my
disaster
But
Jehovah
was
my
support
19
He
brought
me
out
into
a
place
of
safety
He
rescued
me
because
he
was
pleased
with
me
20
Jehovah
rewards
me
according
to
my
righteousness
He
repays
me
according
to
the
innocence
of
my
hands
21
For
I
have
kept
the
ways
of
Jehovah
And
I
have
not
wickedly
abandoned
my
God
22
All
his
judgments
are
before
me
I
will
not
disregard
his
statutes
23
I
will
remain
blameless
before
him
And
I
will
keep
myself
from
error
24
May
Jehovah
repay
me
according
to
my
righteousness
According
to
the
innocence
of
my
hands
before
him
25
With
someone
loyal
you
act
in
loyalty
With
the
blameless
man
you
deal
blamelessly
26
With
the
pure
you
show
yourself
pure
But
with
the
crooked
you
show
yourself
shrewd
27
For
you
save
those
who
are
lowlyBut
you
abase
the
haughty
28
For
it
is
you
who
light
my
lamp
O
Jehovah
My
God
who
lights
up
my
darkness
29
With
your
help
I
can
charge
against
a
marauder
band
By
Gods
power
I
can
scale
a
wall
30
The
way
of
the
true
God
is
perfect
The
saying
of
Jehovah
is
refined
He
is
a
shield
to
all
those
taking
refuge
in
him
31
For
who
is
a
God
besides
Jehovah
And
who
is
a
rock
except
our
God
32
The
true
God
is
the
one
who
clothes
me
with
strength
And
he
will
make
my
way
perfect
33
He
makes
my
feet
like
those
of
a
deer
He
makes
me
stand
on
high
places
34
He
trains
my
hands
for
warfare
My
arms
can
bend
a
bow
of
copper
35
You
give
me
your
shield
of
salvation
Your
right
hand
supports
me
And
your
humility
makes
me
great
36
You
widen
the
path
for
my
footsteps
My
feet
will
not
slip
37
I
will
pursue
my
enemies
and
overtake
them
I
will
not
return
until
they
are
wiped
out
38
I
will
crush
them
so
that
they
cannot
rise
up
They
will
fall
under
my
feet
39
You
will
equip
me
with
strength
for
the
battle
You
will
make
my
foes
collapse
under
me
40
You
will
make
my
enemies
retreat
from
me
And
I
will
put
an
end
to
those
who
hate
me
41
They
cry
for
help
but
there
is
no
one
to
save
them
They
even
cry
to
Jehovah
but
he
does
not
answer
them
42
I
will
pound
them
as
fine
as
dust
in
the
wind
I
will
throw
them
out
like
mud
in
the
streets
43
You
will
rescue
me
from
the
faultfinding
of
the
people
You
will
appoint
me
the
head
of
nations
A
people
whom
I
have
not
known
will
serve
me
44
At
a
mere
report
they
will
obey
me
Foreigners
will
come
cringing
before
me
45
Foreigners
will
lose
courage
They
will
come
trembling
from
their
strongholds
46
Jehovah
is
alive
Praised
be
my
Rock
Let
the
God
of
my
salvation
be
exalted
47
The
true
God
executes
vengeance
for
me
He
subdues
the
peoples
under
me
48
He
rescues
me
from
my
angry
enemies
You
lift
me
high
above
those
who
attack
me
You
save
me
from
the
man
of
violence
49
That
is
why
I
will
glorify
you
among
the
nations
O
Jehovah
And
to
your
name
I
will
sing
praises
50
He
performs
great
acts
of
salvation
for
his
king
He
displays
loyal
love
to
his
anointed
one
To
David
and
his
offspring
forever
To
the
director
A
melody
of
David
19
The
heavens
are
declaring
the
glory
of
God
The
skies
above
proclaim
the
work
of
his
hands

2
Day
after
day
their
speech
bubbles
forth
And
night
after
night
they
reveal
knowledge

3
There
is
no
speech
and
there
are
no
words
Their
voice
is
not
heard

4
But
into
all
the
earth
their
sound
has
gone
out
And
to
the
ends
of
the
inhabited
earth
their
message
In
the
heavens
he
has
pitched
a
tent
for
the
sun
5
It
is
like
a
bridegroom
emerging
from
the
bridal
chamber
It
rejoices
like
a
mighty
man
running
his
course

6
It
emerges
from
one
end
of
the
heavens
And
it
circles
to
their
other
end
And
nothing
is
concealed
from
its
heat

7
The
law
of
Jehovah
is
perfect
restoring
strength
The
reminder
of
Jehovah
is
trustworthy
making
the
inexperienced
one
wise

8
The
orders
from
Jehovah
are
righteous
causing
the
heart
to
rejoice
The
commandment
of
Jehovah
is
clean
making
the
eyes
shine

9
The
fear
of
Jehovah
is
pure
lasting
forever
The
judgments
of
Jehovah
are
true
altogether

They
are
more
desirable
than
gold
Than
much
fine
gold
And
sweeter
than
honey
the
honey
that
drips
from
the
combs
11
By
them
your
servant
has
been
warned
In
keeping
them
there
is
a
large
reward
12
Who
can
discern
mistakes
Pronounce
me
innocent
from
sins
I
am
unaware
of
13
And
hold
your
servant
back
from
presumptuous
acts
Do
not
let
them
dominate
me
Then
I
will
be
complete
And
innocent
of
blatant
sins
14
May
the
words
of
my
mouth
and
the
meditation
of
my
heartBe
pleasing
to
you
O
Jehovah
my
Rock
and
my
Redeemer
To

A

of
David
20
May
Jehovah
answer
you
in
the
day
of
distress
May
the
name
of
the
God
of
Jacob
protect
you

2
May
he
send
you
help
from
the
holy
placeAnd
sustain
you
from
Zion

3
May
he
remember
all
your
gift
offerings
May
he
accept
with
favor
your
burnt
offering
Selah

4
May
he
grant
you
the
desires
of
your
heartAnd
give
success
to
all
your
plans

5
We
will
shout
joyfully
over
your
acts
of
salvation
We
will
lift
our
banners
in
the
name
of
our
God
May
Jehovah
fulfill
all
your
requests

6
Now
I
do
know
that
Jehovah
saves
his
anointed
one
He
answers
him
from
his
holy
heavensWith
great
salvation
by
his
right
hand

7
Some
rely
on
chariots
and
others
on
horses
But
we
call
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
our
God

8
They
have
collapsed
and
fallen
But
we
have
risen
up
and
been
restored

9
O
Jehovah
save
the
king
He
will
answer
us
in
the
day
we
call
for
help
To
the
director
A
melody
of
David
21
O
Jehovah
in
your
strength
the
king
rejoices
How
greatly
he
rejoices
in
your
acts
of
salvation

2
You
have
granted
him
the
desire
of
his
heart
And
you
have
not
withheld
the
request
of
his
lips
Selah

3
For
you
meet
him
with
rich
blessings
You
place
a
crown
of
fine
gold
on
his
head

4
He
asked
you
for
life
and
you
gave
it
to
him
A
long
life
forever
and
ever

5
Your
acts
of
salvation
bring
him
great
glory
Dignity
and
splendor
you
bestow
on
him

6
You
make
him
blessed
forever
You
make
him
glad
with
the
joy
of
your
presence

7
For
the
king
trusts
in
Jehovah
Because
of
the
loyal
love
of
the
Most
High
he
will
never
be
shaken

8
Your
hand
will
find
all
your
enemies
Your
right
hand
will
find
those
hating
you

9
You
will
make
them
like
a
fiery
furnace
at
the
appointed
time
when
you
give
them
attention
Jehovah
will
swallow
them
up
in
his
anger
and
fire
will
consume
them
10
Their
descendants
you
will
destroy
from
the
earth
And
their
offspring
from
the
sons
of
men
11
For
they
intended
to
do
what
is
bad
against
you
They
have
devised
schemes
that
will
not
succeed
12
For
you
will
make
them
retreatBy
aiming
your
bow
at
them
13
Rise
up
O
Jehovah
in
your
strength
We
will
sing
praises
to
your
mightiness
To
the
director
set
to
The
Doe
of
the
Dawn
A
melody
of
David
22
My
God
my
God
why
have
you
forsaken
me
Why
are
you
far
from
saving
me
Far
from
my
cries
of
anguish

2
My
God
I
keep
calling
by
day
and
you
do
not
answer
And
by
night
there
is
no
silence
on
my
part

3
But
you
are
holy
Surrounded
by
the
praises
of
Israel

4
In
you
our
fathers
put
their
trust
They
trusted
and
you
kept
rescuing
them

5
To
you
they
cried
out
and
they
were
saved
They
trusted
in
you
and
they
were
not
disappointed

6
But
I
am
a
worm
and
not
a
man
Scorned
by
men
and
despised
by
the
people

7
All
those
seeing
me
mock
me
They
sneer
and
shake
their
heads
in
derision

8
He
entrusted
himself
to
Jehovah
Let
Him
rescue
him
Let
Him
save
him
for
he
is
so
dear
to
Him

9
You
were
the
One
who
brought
me
out
of
the
womb
The
One
who
made
me
feel
secure
on
my
mothers
breasts
10
I
have
been
entrusted
to
your
care
from
birth
From
my
mothers
womb
you
have
been
my
God
11
Do
not
stay
far
off
from
me
for
trouble
is
nearAnd
I
have
no
other
helper
12
Many
young
bulls
surround
me
Powerful
bulls
of
Bashan
encircle
me
13
They
open
their
mouth
wide
against
me
Like
a
roaring
lion
that
tears
its
prey
to
pieces
14
I
am
poured
out
like
water
All
my
bones
are
out
of
joint
My
heart
has
become
like
wax
It
melts
deep
within
me
15
My
strength
has
dried
up
like
a
piece
of
pottery
My
tongue
sticks
to
my
gums
You
are
bringing
me
down
to
the
dust
of
death
16
For
dogs
surround
me
They
close
in
on
me
like
a
pack
of
evildoers
Like
a
lion
they
are
at
my
hands
and
feet
17
I
can
count
all
my
bones
They
look
on
and
stare
at
me
18
They
divide
my
garments
among
themselves
And
they
cast
lots
for
my
clothing
19
But
you
O
Jehovah
do
not
remain
far
away
You
are
my
strength
hurry
to
help
me
20
Save
me
from
the
sword
My
precious
life
from
the
paws
of
dogs
21
Save
me
from
the
mouth
of
the
lion
and
the
horns
of
wild
bulls
Answer
and
save
me
22
I
will
declare
your
name
to
my
brothers
In
the
midst
of
the
congregation
I
will
praise
you
23
You
who
fear
Jehovah
praise
him
All
you
offspring
of
Jacob
glorify
him
Stand
in
awe
of
him
all
you
offspring
of
Israel
24
For
he
has
not
despised
nor
loathed
the
suffering
of
the
oppressed
one
He
has
not
hidden
his
face
from
him
When
he
cried
to
him
for
help
he
heard
25
I
will
praise
you
in
the
large
congregation
I
will
pay
my
vows
before
those
who
fear
him
26
The
meek
will
eat
and
be
satisfied
Those
seeking
Jehovah
will
praise
him
May
you
enjoy
life
forever
27
All
the
ends
of
the
earth
will
remember
and
turn
to
Jehovah
All
the
families
of
the
nations
will
bow
down
before
you
28
For
the
kingship
belongs
to
Jehovah
He
rules
over
the
nations
29
All
the
prosperous
ones
of
the
earth
will
eat
and
will
bow
down
All
those
going
down
to
the
dust
will
kneel
before
him
None
of
them
can
preserve
their
lives
30
Their
descendants
will
serve
him
The
generation
to
come
will
be
told
about
Jehovah
31
They
will
come
and
tell
of
his
righteousness
They
will
tell
the
people
yet
to
be
born
what
he
has
done
A
melody
of
David
23
Jehovah
is
my
Shepherd
I
will
lack
nothing

2
In
grassy
pastures
he
makes
me
lie
down
He
leads
me
to
well-watered
resting-places

3
He
refreshes
me
He
leads
me
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
for
the
sake
of
his
name

4
Though
I
walk
in
the
valley
of
deep
shadow
I
fear
no
harm
For
you
are
with
me
Your
rod
and
your
staff
reassure
me

5
You
prepare
a
table
for
me
before
my
enemies
You
refresh
my
head
with
oil
My
cup
is
well-filled

6
Surely
goodness
and
loyal
love
will
pursue
me
all
the
days
of
my
life
And
I
will
dwell
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
for
all
my
days
Of
David
A
melody
24
To
Jehovah
belong
the
earth
and
everything
in
it
The
productive
land
and
those
dwelling
on
it

2
For
he
has
solidly
fixed
it
on
the
seasAnd
firmly
established
it
on
the
rivers

3
Who
may
ascend
to
the
mountain
of
Jehovah
And
who
may
stand
up
in
his
holy
place

4
Anyone
with
innocent
hands
and
a
pure
heart
Who
has
not
sworn
a
false
oath
by
My
life
Nor
taken
an
oath
deceitfully

5
He
will
receive
blessings
from
JehovahAnd
righteousness
from
his
God
of
salvation

6
This
is
the
generation
of
those
seeking
him
Of
those
seeking
your
face
O
God
of
Jacob

7
Lift
up
your
heads
you

Open
up
you
ancient
doorways
That

25
To
you
O
Jehovah
I
turn

2
My
God
I
trust
in
you
Do
not
let
me
be
put
to
shame
Do
not
let
my
enemies
gloat
over
me

3
Surely
none
who
hope
in
you
will
be
put
to
shame
But
shame
awaits
those
who
are
treacherous
without
cause

4
Make
me
know
your
ways
O
Jehovah
Teach
me
your
paths

5
Cause
me
to
walk
in
your
truth
and
teach
me
For
you
are
my
God
of
salvation
In
you
I
hope
all
day
long

6
Remember
your
mercy
O
Jehovah
and
your
loyal
love
Which
you
have
always
shown

7
Do
not
remember
the
sins
of
my
youth
and
my
transgressions
Remember
me
according
to
your
loyal
love
For
the
sake
of
your
goodness
O
Jehovah

8
Good
and
upright
is
Jehovah
That
is
why
he
instructs
sinners
in
the
way
to
live

9
He
will
guide
the
meek
in
what
is
right
And
he
will
teach
the
meek
ones
his
way
10
All
the
paths
of
Jehovah
are
loyal
love
and
faithfulnessFor
those
observing
his
covenant
and
his
reminders
11
For
the
sake
of
your
name
O
Jehovah
Forgive
my
error
though
it
is
great
12
Who
is
the
man
fearing
Jehovah
He
will
instruct
him
about
the
way
he
should
choose
13
He
will
experience
what
is
good
And
his
descendants
will
take
possession
of
the
earth
14
Close
friendship
with
Jehovah
belongs
to
those
who
fear
him
And
he
makes
his
covenant
known
to
them
15
My
eyes
are
always
toward
Jehovah
For
he
will
free
my
feet
from
the
net
16
Turn
your
face
to
me
and
show
me
favor
For
I
am
alone
and
helpless
17
The
distresses
of
my
heart
have
multiplied
Free
me
from
my
anguish
18
See
my
affliction
and
my
trouble
And
pardon
all
my
sins
19
See
how
numerous
my
enemies
areAnd
how
violent
their
hatred
is
for
me
20
Guard
my
life
and
save
me
Do
not
let
me
be
put
to
shame
for
I
have
taken
refuge
in
you
21
May
integrity
and
uprightness
safeguard
me
For
my
hope
is
in
you
22
O
God
rescue
Israel
out
of
all
his
distresses
Of
David
26
Judge
me
O
Jehovah
for
I
have
walked
in
my
integrity
In
Jehovah
I
have
trusted
without
wavering

2
Examine
me
O
Jehovah
and
put
me
to
the
test
Refine
my
innermost
thoughts
and
my
heart

3
For
your
loyal
love
is
always
in
front
of
me
And
I
walk
in
your
truth

4
I
do
not
associate
with
deceitful
men
And
I
avoid
those
who
hide
what
they
are

5
I
hate
the
company
of
evil
men
And
I
refuse
to
associate
with
the
wicked

6
I
will
wash
my
hands
in
innocence
And
I
will
march
around
your
altar
O
Jehovah
7
To
cause
the
sound
of
thanksgiving
to
be
heardAnd
to
declare
all
your
wonderful
works

8
Jehovah
I
love
the
house
where
you
dwell
The
place
where
your
glory
resides

9
Do
not
sweep
me
away
with
sinnersNor
take
my
life
away
with
violent
men
10
Whose
hands
engage
in
shameful
conduct
And
whose
right
hand
is
full
of
bribes
11
But
as
for
me
I
will
walk
in
my
integrity
Rescue
me
and
show
me
favor
12
My
foot
is
standing
on
level
ground
In
the
great
congregation
I
will
praise
Jehovah
Of
David
27
Jehovah
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
Whom
should
I
fear
Jehovah
is
the
stronghold
of
my
life
Whom
should
I
dread

2
When
evil
men
attacked
me
to
devour
my
flesh
My
adversaries
and
my
enemies
were
the
ones
who
stumbled
and
fell

3
Though
an
army
should
set
up
camp
against
me
My
heart
will
not
fear
Though
war
should
break
out
against
me
Even
then
I
will
remain
confident

4
One
thing
I
have
asked
from
Jehovah—It
is
what
I
will
look
for—That
I
may
dwell
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
all
the
days
of
my
life
To
gaze
upon
the
pleasantness
of
JehovahAnd
to
look
with
appreciation
upon
his
temple

5
For
he
will
hide
me
in
his
shelter
on
the
day
of
calamity
He
will
conceal
me
in
the
secret
place
of
his
tent
High
on
a
rock
he
will
place
me

6
Now
my
head
is
high
above
my
enemies
who
surround
me
I
will
offer
sacrifices
at
his
tent
with
joyful
shouting
I
will
sing
praises
to
Jehovah

7
Hear
me
O
Jehovah
when
I
cry
out
Show
me
favor
and
answer
me

8
Speaking
for
you
my
heart
has
said
Seek
to
find
my
face
Your
face
O
Jehovah
I
will
seek
to
find

9
Do
not
hide
your
face
from
me
Do
not
turn
your
servant
away
in
your
anger
You
are
my
helper
Do
not
forsake
me
or
leave
me
my
God
of
salvation
10
Even
if
my
own
father
and
mother
abandon
me
Jehovah
himself
will
take
me
in
11
Instruct
me
in
your
way
O
Jehovah
Lead
me
in
the
path
of
uprightness
because
of
my
foes
12
Do
not
hand
me
over
to
my
adversaries
For
false
witnesses
have
risen
up
against
me
And
they
threaten
me
with
violence
13
Where
would
I
be
if
I
did
not
have
faithThat
I
would
see
Jehovahs
goodness
in
the
land
of
the
living
14
Hope
in
Jehovah
Be
courageous
and
strong
of
heart
Yes
hope
in
Jehovah
Of
David
28
To
you
I
keep
calling
O
Jehovah
my
Rock
Do
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
me
If
you
keep
silent
toward
me
I
will
become
like
those
going
down
to
the
pit

2
Hear
my
pleas
when
I
cry
to
you
for
helpAs
I
lift
up
my
hands
toward
the
innermost
room
of
your
sanctuary

3
Do
not
drag
me
away
with
the
wicked
with
those
practicing
what
is
hurtful
Those
who
are
speaking
words
of
peace
with
their
fellow
man
while
evil
is
in
their
hearts

4
Pay
them
back
for
their
deeds
According
to
their
evil
practices
Repay
them
for
the
work
of
their
hands
According
to
what
they
have
done

5
For
they
pay
no
attention
to
the
activities
of
Jehovah
Nor
to
the
work
of
his
hands
He
will
tear
them
down
and
not
build
them
up

6
May
Jehovah
be
praised
For
he
has
heard
my
pleas
for
help

7
Jehovah
is
my
strength
and
my
shield
In
him
my
heart
trusts
I
have
received
his
help
and
my
heart
rejoices
So
I
will
praise
him
with
my
song

8
Jehovah
is
a
strength
for
his
people
He
is
a
stronghold
bringing
grand
salvation
to
his
anointed
one

9
Save
your
people
and
bless
your
inheritance
Shepherd
them
and
carry
them
in
your
arms
forever
A

his
due

ones
Give

due

his
glory
and
strength

Give
Jehovah
the
glory

his
name
Bow

The
voice
of
Jehovah
is
heard
over
the
waters
The
glorious

thunders
Jehovah
is
over
many
waters

4
The
voice
of
Jehovah
is
powerful
The
voice
of
Jehovah
is
splendid

5
The
voice
of
Jehovah
is
breaking
the
cedars
Yes
Jehovah
shatters
the
cedars
of
Lebanon

6
He
makes
Lebanon
skip
like
a
calf
And
Sirion
like
a
young
wild
bull

7
The
voice
of
Jehovah
strikes
with
flames
of
fire
8
The
voice
of
Jehovah
makes
the
wilderness
shudder
Jehovah
makes
the
wilderness
of
Kadesh
shudder

9
The
voice
of
Jehovah
makes
the
deer
shudder
and
give
birthAnd
strips
bare
the
forests
And
all
in
his
temple
say
Glory
10
Jehovah
sits
enthroned
above
the
flooding
waters
Jehovah
sits
enthroned
as
King
forever
11
Jehovah
will
give
strength
to
his
people
Jehovah
will
bless
his
people
with
peace
A
melody
A
song
of
inauguration
of
the
house
Of
David
30
I
will
exalt
you
O
Jehovah
for
you
have
lifted
me
up
You
did
not
let
my
enemies
rejoice
over
me

2
O
Jehovah
my
God
I
cried
to
you
for
help
and
you
healed
me

3
O
Jehovah
you
have
lifted
me
up
from
the
Grave
You
kept
me
alive
you
spared
me
from
sinking
into
the
pit

4
Sing
praises
to
Jehovah
you
his
loyal
ones
Give
thanks
to
his
holy
name
5
Because
being
under
his
anger
is
only
for
a
moment
But
being
in
his
favor
is
for
a
lifetime
Weeping
may
come
in
the
evening
but
in
the
morning
there
is
a
joyful
cry

6
When
I
was
untroubled
I
said
I
will
never
be
shaken

7
O
Jehovah
while
I
was
in
your
favor
you
made
me
as
strong
as
a
mountain
But
when
you
hid
your
face
I
became
terrified

8
To
you
O
Jehovah
I
kept
calling
And
to
Jehovah
I
kept
pleading
for
favor

9
What
profit
is
there
in
my
death
in
my
going
down
to
the
pit
Will
the
dust
praise
you
Will
it
tell
of
your
faithfulness
10
Hear
O
Jehovah
and
show
me
favor
O
Jehovah
become
my
helper
11
You
have
changed
my
mourning
into
dancing
You
have
removed
my
sackcloth
and
you
clothe
me
with
rejoicing
12
So
that
I
may
sing
your
praise
and
not
keep
silent
O
Jehovah
my
God
I
will
praise
you
forever
To
the
director
A
melody
of
David
31
In
you
O
Jehovah
I
have
taken
refuge
May
I
never
be
put
to
shame
Rescue
me
because
of
your
righteousness

2
Incline
your
ear
to
me
Come
quickly
to
my
rescue
Become
for
me
a
mountain
stronghold
A
fortified
place
to
save
me

3
For
you
are
my
crag
and
my
stronghold
For
the
sake
of
your
name
you
will
lead
me
and
guide
me

4
You
will
free
me
from
the
net
that
they
have
secretly
laid
for
me
For
you
are
my
fortress

5
Into
your
hand
I
entrust
my
spirit
You
have
redeemed
me
O
Jehovah
the
God
of
truth

6
I
hate
those
who
are
devoted
to
worthless
vain
idols
But
as
for
me
I
trust
in
Jehovah

7
I
will
rejoice
greatly
in
your
loyal
love
For
you
have
seen
my
affliction
You
are
aware
of
my
deep
distress

8
You
have
not
handed
me
over
to
the
enemy
But
you
make
me
stand
in
a
place
of
safety

9
Show
me
favor
O
Jehovah
for
I
am
in
distress
Anguish
has
made
my
eyes
weak
my
whole
body
as
well
10
My
life
is
consumed
with
griefAnd
my
years
with
groaning
My
strength
is
waning
because
of
my
error
My
bones
grow
weak
11
I
am
scorned
by
all
my
adversaries
Especially
my
neighbors
And
I
am
dreaded
by
my
acquaintances
When
they
see
me
in
public
they
flee
from
me
12
I
am
put
out
of
their
heart
and
forgotten
as
if
I
were
dead
I
am
like
a
broken
jar
13
I
have
heard
many
evil
rumors
Terror
surrounds
me
When
they
gather
together
as
one
against
me
They
scheme
to
take
away
my
life
14
But
I
trust
in
you
O
Jehovah
I
declare
You
are
my
God
15
My
days
are
in
your
hand
Rescue
me
from
the
hand
of
my
enemies
and
from
those
persecuting
me
16
Make
your
face
shine
upon
your
servant
Save
me
by
your
loyal
love
17
O
Jehovah
may
I
not
be
put
to
shame
when
I
call
on
you
May
the
wicked
be
put
to
shame
May
they
be
silenced
in
the
Grave
18
May
lying
lips
become
speechless
Lips
that
speak
arrogantly
against
the
righteous
with
haughtiness
and
contempt
19
How
abundant
your
goodness
is
You
have
stored
it
up
for
those
who
fear
you
And
you
have
shown
it
before
all
men
in
behalf
of
those
taking
refuge
in
you
20
You
will
conceal
them
in
the
secret
place
of
your
presenceFrom
the
schemes
of
men
You
will
hide
them
in
your
shelterFrom
malicious
attacks
21
May
Jehovah
be
praised
For
in
a
wonderful
way
he
has
shown
his
loyal
love
to
me
in
a
besieged
city
22
As
for
me
I
panicked
and
said
I
will
perish
from
before
you
But
you
heard
my
pleas
for
help
when
I
cried
out
to
you
23
Love
Jehovah
all
you
who
are
loyal
to
him
Jehovah
protects
the
faithful
But
he
repays
exceedingly
anyone
showing
haughtiness
24
Be
courageous
and
may
your
heart
be
strong
All
you
who
are
waiting
for
Jehovah
Of
David
Maskil
32
Happy
is
the
one
whose
transgression
is
pardoned
whose
sin
is
covered

2
Happy
is
the
man
whom
Jehovah
does
not
charge
with
guilt
In
whose
spirit
there
is
no
deceit

3
When
I
kept
silent
my
bones
wasted
away
because
of
my
groaning
all
day
long

4
For
day
and
night
your
hand
was
heavy
upon
me
My
strength
evaporated
like
water
in
the
dry
summer
heat
Selah

5
Finally
I
confessed
my
sin
to
you
I
did
not
cover
my
error
I
said
I
will
confess
my
transgressions
to
Jehovah
And
you
pardoned
the
error
of
my
sins
Selah

6
This
is
why
every
loyal
one
will
pray
to
youWhile
you
may
yet
be
found
Then
even
the
floodwaters
will
not
reach
him

7
You
are
a
hiding
place
for
me
You
will
safeguard
me
from
distress
You
will
surround
me
with
joyful
shouts
of
deliverance
Selah

8
I
will
give
you
insight
and
instruct
you
in
the
way
you
should
go
I
will
give
you
advice
with
my
eye
upon
you

9
Do
not
become
like
a
horse
or
a
mule
without
understanding
Whose
spiritedness
must
be
controlled
with
a
bridle
or
a
halterBefore
it
will
come
near
to
you
10
Many
are
the
pains
of
the
wicked
But
the
one
trusting
in
Jehovah
is
surrounded
by
His
loyal
love
11
Rejoice
in
Jehovah
and
be
joyful
you
righteous
ones
Shout
joyfully
all
you
who
are
upright
in
heart
1
Shout
joyfully
you
righteous
ones
because
of
Jehovah
It
is
fitting
for
the
upright
to
praise
him

2
Give
thanks
to
Jehovah
with
the
harp
Sing
praises
to
him
with
a
ten-stringed
instrument

3
Sing
to
him
a
new
song
Play
skillfully
on
the
strings
along
with
shouts
of
joy

4
For
the
word
of
Jehovah
is
upright
And
everything
he
does
is
trustworthy

5
He
loves
righteousness
and
justice
The
earth
is
filled
with
Jehovahs
loyal
love

6
By
the
word
of
Jehovah
the
heavens
were
made
And
by
the
spirit
of
his
mouth
everything
in
them

7
He
gathers
the
seawaters
like
a
dam
He
puts
the
surging
waters
in
storehouses

8
Let
the
whole
earth
fear
Jehovah
Let
the
inhabitants
of
the
productive
land
be
in
awe
of
him

9
For
he
spoke
and
it
came
to
be
He
commanded
and
it
stood
firm
10
Jehovah
has
frustrated
the
schemes
of
the
nations
He
has
thwarted
the
plans
of
the
peoples
11
But
the
decisions
of
Jehovah
will
stand
forever
The
thoughts
of
his
heart
are
from
generation
to
generation
12
Happy
is
the
nation
whose
God
is
Jehovah
The
people
he
has
chosen
as
his
own
possession
13
Jehovah
looks
down
from
heaven
He
sees
all
the
sons
of
men
14
From
his
place
of
residence
He
gazes
on
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
15
He
is
the
one
forming
the
hearts
of
all
He
examines
all
their
works
16
No
king
is
saved
by
a
large
army
A
mighty
man
is
not
saved
by
his
great
power
17
The
horse
is
a
false
hope
for
salvation
Its
great
strength
does
not
ensure
escape
18
Look
The
eye
of
Jehovah
watches
over
those
fearing
him
Those
waiting
for
his
loyal
love
19
To
rescue
them
from
deathAnd
to
keep
them
alive
during
famine
20
We
are
in
expectation
of
Jehovah
He
is
our
helper
and
our
shield
21
Our
hearts
rejoice
in
him
For
we
trust
in
his
holy
name
22
May
your
loyal
love
rest
upon
us
O
Jehovah
While
we
keep
waiting
for
you
Of
David
when
he
disguised
his
sanity
before
Abimelech
who
drove
him
away
and
he
left
34
I
will
praise
Jehovah
at
all
times
His
praise
will
be
on
my
lips
constantly

2
I
will
boast
in
Jehovah
The
meek
will
hear
and
rejoice

3
Magnify
Jehovah
along
with
me
Let
us
exalt
his
name
together

4
I
inquired
of
Jehovah
and
he
answered
me
He
rescued
me
from
all
my
fears

5
Those
who
looked
to
him
became
radiant
Their
faces
could
not
be
put
to
shame

6
This
lowly
one
called
and
Jehovah
heard
He
saved
him
from
all
his
distresses

7
The
angel
of
Jehovah
camps
all
around
those
fearing
Him
And
he
rescues
them

8
Taste
and
see
that
Jehovah
is
good
Happy
is
the
man
who
takes
refuge
in
him

9
Fear
Jehovah
all
you
his
holy
ones
For
those
who
fear
him
lack
nothing
10
Even
strong
young
lions
have
been
reduced
to
hunger
But
those
seeking
Jehovah
will
lack
nothing
good
11
Come
my
sons
listen
to
me
I
will
teach
you
the
fear
of
Jehovah
12
Who
among
you
takes
pleasure
in
lifeAnd
would
love
to
see
many
good
days
13
Then
guard
your
tongue
from
what
is
bad
Your
lips
from
speaking
deception
14
Turn
away
from
what
is
bad
and
do
what
is
good
Seek
peace
and
pursue
it
15
The
eyes
of
Jehovah
are
on
the
righteous
And
his
ears
listen
to
their
cry
for
help
16
But
the
face
of
Jehovah
is
against
those
doing
what
is
bad
To
erase
all
memory
of
them
from
the
earth
17
They
cried
out
and
Jehovah
heard
He
rescued
them
from
all
their
distresses
18
Jehovah
is
close
to
the
brokenhearted
He
saves
those
who
are
crushed
in
spirit
19
Many
are
the
hardships
of
the
righteous
one
But
Jehovah
rescues
him
from
them
all
20
He
is
guarding
all
his
bones
Not
one
of
them
has
been
broken
21
Disaster
will
put
the
wicked
to
death
Those
hating
the
righteous
will
be
found
guilty
22
Jehovah
is
redeeming
the
life
of
his
servants
None
of
those
taking
refuge
in
him
will
be
found
guilty
Of
David
35
O
Jehovah
defend
my
case
against
my
opposers
Fight
against
those
who
fight
against
me

2
Take
up
your
buckler
and
large
shield
And
rise
up
to
my
defense

3
Lift
up
your
spear
and
battle-ax
against
my
pursuers
Say
to
me
I
am
your
salvation

4
May
those
who
are
hunting
for
my
life
be
put
to
shame
and
humiliated
May
those
who
are
plotting
to
destroy
me
retreat
in
disgrace

5
May
they
become
like
chaff
in
the
wind
May
Jehovahs
angel
drive
them
away

6
May
their
path
be
dark
and
slipperyAs
Jehovahs
angel
pursues
them

7
For
without
cause
they
have
hidden
a
net
to
trap
me
Without
cause
they
have
dug
a
pit
for
me

8
May
disaster
come
upon
him
by
surprise
May
the
net
that
he
hid
catch
him
May
he
fall
into
it
and
be
destroyed

9
But
I
will
rejoice
in
Jehovah
I
will
be
joyful
in
his
acts
of
salvation
10
All
my
bones
will
say
O
Jehovah
who
is
like
you
You
rescue
the
helpless
from
those
who
are
stronger
The
helpless
and
the
poor
from
those
who
rob
them
11
Malicious
witnesses
come
forward
Asking
me
things
I
know
nothing
about
12
They
repay
me
with
bad
for
good
Making
me
feel
bereaved
13
But
when
they
were
ill
I
clothed
myself
with
sackcloth
I
afflicted
myself
by
fasting
And
when
my
prayer
would
return
unanswered
14
I
walked
about
mourning
as
for
a
friend
or
a
brother
of
mine
I
bowed
down
in
sorrow
like
one
mourning
for
his
mother
15
But
when
I
stumbled
they
rejoiced
and
gathered
together
They
gathered
together
to
strike
me
down
in
ambush
They
tore
me
to
pieces
and
did
not
keep
silent
16
The
ungodly
scornfully
mock
me
They
grind
their
teeth
against
me
17
O
Jehovah
how
long
will
you
just
look
on
Rescue
me
from
their
attacks
My
precious
life
from
the
young
lions
18
Then
I
will
give
thanks
to
you
in
the
great
congregation
I
will
praise
you
among
the
throngs
of
people
19
Do
not
let
those
who
for
no
reason
are
my
enemies
gloat
over
me
Do
not
let
those
hating
me
without
cause
wink
their
eyes
maliciously
20
For
they
do
not
speak
words
of
peace
But
they
deceptively
scheme
against
the
peaceful
ones
of
the
land
21
They
open
their
mouth
wide
to
accuse
me
Saying
Aha
Aha
Our
eyes
have
seen
it
22
You
have
seen
this
O
Jehovah
Do
not
remain
silent
O
Jehovah
do
not
stay
far
from
me
23
Awake
and
rise
to
my
defense
My
God
Jehovah
defend
me
in
my
legal
case
24
Judge
me
according
to
your
righteousness
O
Jehovah
my
God
Do
not
let
them
gloat
over
me
25
May
they
never
say
to
themselves
Aha
We
got
what
we
wanted
May
they
never
say
We
have
swallowed
him
up
26
Let
all
of
them
be
put
to
shame
and
disgraced
Those
who
gloat
over
my
calamity
Let
those
who
exalt
themselves
over
me
be
clothed
with
shame
and
humiliation
27
But
let
those
who
take
pleasure
in
my
righteousness
shout
joyfully
May
they
constantly
say
May
Jehovah
be
magnified
who
takes
pleasure
in
the
peace
of
his
servant
28
Then
my
tongue
will
recount
your
righteousnessAnd
praise
you
all
day
long
To
the
director
Of
Jehovahs
servant
David
36
Transgression
speaks
to
the
wicked
one
deep
within
his
heart
There
is
no
fear
of
God
before
his
eyes

2
For
in
his
own
eyes
he
flatters
himself
too
muchTo
detect
and
hate
his
error

3
The
words
of
his
mouth
are
hurtful
and
deceptive
He
shows
no
insight
for
doing
what
is
good

4
He
plots
hurtful
schemes
even
on
his
bed
He
is
set
on
a
path
that
is
not
good
He
does
not
reject
what
is
bad

5
O
Jehovah
your
loyal
love
reaches
to
the
heavens
Your
faithfulness
up
to
the
clouds

6
Your
righteousness
is
like
majestic
mountains
Your
judgments
are
like
vast
deep
waters
Man
and
beast
you
preserve
O
Jehovah

7
How
precious
your
loyal
love
is
O
God
In
the
shadow
of
your
wings
The
sons
of
men
take
refuge

8
They
drink
their
fill
of
the
rich
bounty
of
your
house
And
you
cause
them
to
drink
of
the
torrent
of
your
delights

9
With
you
is
the
source
of
life
By
your
light
we
can
see
light
10
Continue
showing
your
loyal
love
to
those
who
know
you
And
your
righteousness
to
the
upright
in
heart
11
Do
not
let
the
foot
of
the
haughty
tread
on
meOr
the
hand
of
the
wicked
drive
me
away
12
There
the
wrongdoers
have
fallen
They
have
been
knocked
down
and
cannot
get
up
Of
David
37
Do
not
be
upset
because
of
evil
menOr
envious
of
wrongdoers

2
They
will
quickly
wither
like
grassAnd
shrivel
like
green
new
grass

3
Trust
in
Jehovah
and
do
what
is
good
Reside
in
the
earth
and
act
with
faithfulness

4
Find
exquisite
delight
in
Jehovah
And
he
will
grant
you
the
desires
of
your
heart

5
Commit
your
way
to
Jehovah
Rely
on
him
and
he
will
act
in
your
behalf

6
He
will
make
your
righteousness
shine
like
daybreak
And
your
justice
like
the
midday
sun

7
Keep
silent
before
JehovahAnd
wait
expectantly
for
him
Do
not
be
upset
by
the
manWho
succeeds
in
carrying
out
his
schemes

8
Let
go
of
anger
and
abandon
rage
Do
not
become
upset
and
turn
to
doing
evil

9
For
evil
men
will
be
done
away
with
But
those
hoping
in
Jehovah
will
possess
the
earth
10
Just
a
little
while
longer
and
the
wicked
will
be
no
more
You
will
look
at
where
they
were
And
they
will
not
be
there
11
But
the
meek
will
possess
the
earth
And
they
will
find
exquisite
delight
in
the
abundance
of
peace
12
The
wicked
man
plots
against
the
righteous
He
grinds
his
teeth
at
him
13
But
Jehovah
will
laugh
at
him
For
He
knows
that
his
day
will
come
14
The
wicked
draw
their
swords
and
bend
their
bowsTo
bring
down
the
oppressed
and
the
poor
To
slaughter
those
whose
way
is
upright
15
But
their
sword
will
pierce
their
own
heart
Their
bows
will
be
broken
16
Better
is
the
little
of
the
righteous
oneThan
the
abundance
of
many
wicked
ones
17
For
the
arms
of
the
wicked
will
be
broken
But
Jehovah
will
support
the
righteous
18
Jehovah
is
aware
of
what
the
blameless
go
through
And
their
inheritance
will
last
forever
19
They
will
not
be
put
to
shame
in
the
time
of
disaster
In
the
time
of
famine
they
will
have
plenty
20
But
the
wicked
will
perish
The
enemies
of
Jehovah
will
vanish
like
glorious
pastures
They
will
vanish
like
smoke
21
The
wicked
one
borrows
and
does
not
repay
But
the
righteous
one
is
generous
and
giving
22
Those
blessed
by
Him
will
possess
the
earth
But
those
cursed
by
Him
will
be
done
away
with
23
Jehovah
guides
the
steps
of
a
manWhen
He
finds
pleasure
in
his
way
24
Although
he
may
fall
he
will
not
be
hurled
down
For
Jehovah
supports
him
by
the
hand
25
I
was
once
young
and
now
I
am
old
But
I
have
not
seen
anyone
righteous
abandoned
Nor
his
children
looking
for
bread
26
He
always
lends
freely
And
his
children
are
in
line
for
a
blessing
27
Turn
away
from
bad
and
do
what
is
good
And
you
will
remain
forever
28
For
Jehovah
loves
justice
And
he
will
not
abandon
his
loyal
ones
They
will
always
be
guarded
But
the
descendants
of
the
wicked
will
be
done
away
with
29
The
righteous
will
possess
the
earth
And
they
will
live
forever
on
it
30
The
mouth
of
the
righteous
one
imparts
wisdom
And
his
tongue
speaks
about
justice
31
The
law
of
his
God
is
in
his
heart
His
steps
will
not
falter
32
The
wicked
watches
the
righteous
Seeking
to
put
him
to
death
33
But
Jehovah
will
not
abandon
him
to
the
hand
of
that
oneOr
find
him
guilty
when
he
is
judged
34
Hope
in
Jehovah
and
follow
his
way
And
he
will
exalt
you
to
take
possession
of
the
earth
When
the
wicked
are
done
away
with
you
will
see
it
35
I
have
seen
the
ruthless
evil
manSpreading
out
like
a
luxuriant
tree
in
its
native
soil
36
But
he
suddenly
passed
away
and
was
gone
I
kept
searching
for
him
and
he
could
not
be
found
37
Take
note
of
the
blameless
one
And
keep
the
upright
one
in
sight
For
the
future
of
that
man
will
be
peaceful
38
But
all
the
transgressors
will
be
destroyed
The
future
of
wicked
people
will
be
cut
off
39
The
salvation
of
the
righteous
is
from
Jehovah
He
is
their
fortress
in
the
time
of
distress
40
Jehovah
will
help
them
and
rescue
them
He
will
rescue
them
from
the
wicked
and
save
them
Because
they
take
refuge
in
him
A
melody
of
David
to
serve
as
a
reminder
38
O
Jehovah
do
not
reprove
me
in
your
anger
Nor
correct
me
in
your
wrath

2
For
your
arrows
have
pierced
deep
into
me
And
your
hand
presses
down
on
me

3
My
whole
body
is
sick
because
of
your
indignation
There
is
no
peace
within
my
bones
because
of
my
sin

4
For
my
errors
loom
over
my
head
Like
a
heavy
burden
they
are
too
much
for
me
to
bear

5
My
wounds
stink
and
festerBecause
of
my
foolishness

6
I
am
distressed
and
extremely
downcast
I
walk
around
sad
all
day
long

7
There
is
a
burning
within
me
My
whole
body
is
sick

8
I
have
grown
numb
and
become
completely
crushed
My
anguished
heart
makes
me
groan
aloud

9
O
Jehovah
all
my
desires
are
before
you
And
my
sighing
is
not
hidden
from
you
10
My
heart
pounds
my
strength
is
gone
And
the
light
of
my
eyes
has
left
me
11
My
friends
and
my
companions
avoid
me
because
of
my
plague
And
my
close
acquaintances
keep
their
distance
12
Those
seeking
my
life
set
traps
Those
trying
to
harm
me
speak
of
ruin
They
mutter
deception
all
day
long
13
But
like
someone
deaf
I
would
not
listen
Like
someone
speechless
I
would
not
open
my
mouth
14
I
have
become
like
a
man
who
cannot
hear
Whose
mouth
has
nothing
to
say
in
defense
15
For
on
you
O
Jehovah
I
waited
And
you
answered
me
O
Jehovah
my
God
16
For
I
said
May
they
not
gloat
over
meOr
exalt
themselves
over
me
if
my
foot
slips
17
For
I
was
ready
to
collapse
And
my
pain
was
always
with
me
18
I
confessed
my
error
I
was
troubled
by
my
sin
19
But
my
enemies
are
vigorous
and
mighty
Those
hating
me
for
no
reason
have
become
numerous
20
They
repaid
me
with
bad
for
good
They
were
resisting
me
for
pursuing
what
is
good
21
Do
not
abandon
me
O
Jehovah
O
God
do
not
remain
far
away
from
me
22
Do
hurry
to
help
me
O
Jehovah
my
salvation
To
the
director
of
Jeduthun
A
melody
of
David
39
I
said
I
will
guard
my
stepTo
avoid
sinning
with
my
tongue
I
will
guard
my
mouth
with
a
muzzleAs
long
as
anyone
wicked
is
in
my
presence

2
I
was
speechless
and
silent
I
kept
quiet
even
about
what
is
good
But
my
pain
was
intense

3
My
heart
smoldered
inside
me
As
I
pondered
the
fire
kept
burning
Then
my
tongue
spoke

4
O
Jehovah
help
me
to
know
what
my
end
will
be
And
the
measure
of
my
days
So
that
I
may
know
how
short
my
life
is

5
Indeed
you
have
made
my
days
just
a
few
And
my
life
span
is
as
nothing
before
you
Surely
every
man
though
he
seems
secure
is
nothing
but
a
mere
breath
Selah

6
Surely
every
man
walks
about
like
a
shadow
He
rushes
around
for
nothing
He
piles
up
wealth
not
knowing
who
will
enjoy
it

7
What
then
can
I
hope
for
O
Jehovah
You
are
my
only
hope

8
Save
me
from
all
my
transgressions
Do
not
let
the
foolish
one
make
me
an
object
of
contempt

9
I
remained
speechless
I
could
not
open
my
mouth
Because
this
was
your
doing
10
Remove
your
plague
from
me
I
am
worn
down
because
your
hand
strikes
me
11
You
correct
man
with
punishment
for
his
error
You
consume
the
things
he
treasures
just
as
a
moth
does
Surely
every
man
is
but
a
mere
breath
Selah
12
Hear
my
prayer
O
Jehovah
Listen
to
my
cry
for
help
Do
not
ignore
my
tears
For
I
am
but
a
foreign
resident
to
you
A
traveler
passing
through
just
like
all
my
forefathers
13
Turn
your
harsh
gaze
away
from
me
so
that
I
may
cheer
upBefore
I
pass
away
and
I
am
gone
To
the
director
Of
David
A
melody
40
I
earnestly
hoped
in
Jehovah
And
he
inclined
his
ear
to
me
and
heard
my
cry
for
help

2
He
brought
me
up
out
of
a
roaring
pit
Out
of
the
slimy
mire
And
he
set
my
feet
upon
a
crag
He
made
my
footing
secure

3
Then
he
put
a
new
song
in
my
mouth
Praise
to
our
God
Many
will
look
on
in
aweAnd
put
their
trust
in
Jehovah

4
Happy
is
the
man
who
trusts
in
JehovahAnd
who
does
not
look
to
the
defiant
or
to
those
who
are
false

5
How
many
things
you
have
done
O
Jehovah
my
God
Your
wonderful
works
and
your
thoughts
toward
us
None
can
compare
to
you
If
I
were
to
try
to
tell
and
speak
of
them
They
would
be
too
numerous
to
recount

6
Sacrifice
and
offering
you
did
not
desire
But
you
opened
up
my
ears
to
hear
You
did
not
ask
for
burnt
offerings
and
sin
offerings

7
Then
I
said
Look
I
have
come
In
the
scroll
it
is
written
about
me

8
To
do
your
will
O
my
God
is
my
delight
And
your
law
is
deep
within
me

9
I
proclaim
the
good
news
of
righteousness
in
the
great
congregation
Look
I
do
not
restrain
my
lips
O
Jehovah
as
you
well
know
10
I
do
not
cover
over
your
righteousness
in
my
heart
I
declare
your
faithfulness
and
salvation
I
do
not
hide
your
loyal
love
and
your
truth
in
the
great
congregation
11
O
Jehovah
do
not
withhold
your
mercy
from
me
May
your
loyal
love
and
your
truth
constantly
safeguard
me
12
The
calamities
surrounding
me
are
too
many
to
count
So
many
of
my
errors
overwhelm
me
that
I
cannot
see
my
way
They
are
more
numerous
than
the
hairs
of
my
head
And
I
have
lost
heart
13
Please
be
willing
O
Jehovah
to
save
me
O
Jehovah
hurry
to
help
me
14
May
all
those
seeking
to
take
my
lifeBe
put
to
shame
and
disgraced
May
those
who
delight
in
my
calamityRetreat
in
humiliation
15
May
those
who
are
saying
to
me
Aha
Aha
Be
appalled
because
of
their
own
shame
16
But
let
those
seeking
youExult
and
rejoice
in
you
May
those
who
love
your
acts
of
salvation
always
say
May
Jehovah
be
magnified
17
But
I
am
helpless
and
poor
May
Jehovah
pay
attention
to
me
You
are
my
helper
and
my
rescuer
My
God
do
not
delay
To
the
director
A
melody
of
David
41
Happy
is
anyone
who
shows
consideration
to
the
lowly
one
Jehovah
will
rescue
him
in
the
day
of
calamity

2
Jehovah
will
guard
him
and
keep
him
alive
He
will
be
pronounced
happy
in
the
earth
You
will
never
turn
him
over
to
the
will
of
his
enemies

3
Jehovah
will
sustain
him
on
his
sickbed
During
his
sickness
you
will
completely
change
his
bed

4
For
I
said
O
Jehovah
show
me
favor
Heal
me
for
I
have
sinned
against
you

5
But
my
enemies
speak
evil
about
me
When
will
he
die
and
his
name
perish

6
If
one
of
them
comes
to
see
me
his
heart
speaks
falsely
He
gathers
something
harmful
to
say
Then
he
goes
out
and
spreads
it
abroad

7
All
those
who
hate
me
whisper
to
one
another
They
are
scheming
something
bad
against
me

8
A
dreadful
thing
has
overtaken
him
Now
that
he
is
down
he
will
not
rise
again

9
Even
the
man
at
peace
with
me
one
whom
I
trusted
Who
was
eating
my
bread
has
lifted
his
heel
against
me
10
But
you
O
Jehovah
show
me
favor
and
raise
me
up
So
that
I
may
repay
them
11
By
this
I
will
know
that
you
are
pleased
with
me
When
my
enemy
cannot
shout
in
triumph
over
me
12
As
for
me
you
uphold
me
because
of
my
integrity
You
will
keep
me
in
your
presence
forever
13
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
be
praisedThroughout
all
eternity
Amen
and
Amen
To
the
director
Maskil
of
the
sons
of
Korah
42
As
a
deer
that
longs
for
streams
of
water
So
I
long
for
you
O
God

2
I
do
thirst
for
God
for
the
living
God
When
may
I
come
and
appear
before
God

3
My
tears
are
my
food
day
and
night
All
day
long
people
taunt
me
Where
is
your
God

4
These
things
I
remember
and
I
pour
out
my
soul
For
I
once
walked
along
with
the
multitude
I
used
to
walk
solemnly
before
them
to
the
house
of
God
With
sounds
of
rejoicing
and
thanksgiving
Those
of
a
crowd
celebrating
a
festival

5
Why
am
I
in
despair
Why
is
this
turmoil
within
me
Wait
for
God
For
I
will
yet
praise
him
as
my
Grand
Savior

6
My
God
I
am
in
despair
That
is
why
I
remember
you
From
the
land
of
Jordan
and
the
peaks
of
Hermon
From
Mount
Mizar

7
Deep
waters
call
to
deep
watersAt
the
sound
of
your
waterfalls
All
your
surging
waves
have
overwhelmed
me

8
By
day
Jehovah
will
grant
me
his
loyal
love
And
by
night
his
song
will
be
with
me—a
prayer
to
the
God
of
my
life

9
I
will
say
to
God
my
crag
Why
have
you
forgotten
me
Why
should
I
walk
about
sad
because
of
the
oppression
by
my
enemy
10
With
murderous
hostility
my
enemies
taunt
me
All
day
long
they
taunt
me
Where
is
your
God
11
Why
am
I
in
despair
Why
is
this
turmoil
within
me
Wait
for
God
For
I
will
yet
praise
him
as
my
Grand
Savior
and
my
God
1
Judge
me
O
God
Defend
my
legal
case
against
a
disloyal
nation
Rescue
me
from
the
man
of
deception
and
unrighteousness

2
For
you
are
my
God
my
fortress
Why
have
you
cast
me
off
Why
must
I
walk
about
sad
because
of
the
oppression
by
my
enemy

3
Send
out
your
light
and
your
truth
May
these
lead
me
May
they
guide
me
to
your
holy
mountain
and
to
your
grand
tabernacle

4
Then
I
will
come
to
the
altar
of
God
To
God
my
exceeding
joy
And
I
will
praise
you
with
the
harp
O
God
my
God

5
Why
am
I
in
despair
Why
is
this
turmoil
within
me
Wait
for
God
For
I
will
yet
praise
him
as
my
Grand
Savior
and
my
God
To
the
director
Of
the
sons
of
Korah
Maskil
44
O
God
we
have
heard
with
our
own
ears
Our
forefathers
have
recounted
to
us
The
deeds
you
accomplished
in
their
days
In
the
days
of
long
ago

2
With
your
hand
you
drove
away
nationsAnd
settled
our
forefathers
there
You
crushed
nations
and
drove
them
out

3
It
was
not
by
their
own
sword
that
they
took
possession
of
the
land
And
their
own
arm
did
not
bring
them
victory
Rather
it
was
by
your
right
hand
and
your
arm
and
the
light
of
your
face
For
you
took
pleasure
in
them

4
You
are
my
King
O
God
Command
complete
victory
for
Jacob

5
By
your
power
we
will
drive
back
our
adversaries
In
your
name
we
will
trample
down
those
who
rise
up
against
us

6
For
I
do
not
trust
in
my
bow
And
my
sword
cannot
save
me

7
It
was
you
who
saved
us
from
our
adversaries
You
who
humiliated
those
who
hate
us

8
To
God
we
will
offer
praise
all
day
long
And
we
will
give
thanks
to
your
name
forever
Selah

9
But
now
you
have
cast
us
off
and
humiliated
us
And
you
do
not
go
out
with
our
armies
10
You
keep
making
us
retreat
from
our
adversary
Those
who
hate
us
take
whatever
they
want
11
You
hand
us
over
to
be
devoured
like
sheep
You
have
scattered
us
among
the
nations
12
You
sell
your
people
for
next
to
nothing
You
make
no
profit
from
the
sale
13
You
make
us
a
reproach
to
our
neighbors
An
object
of
ridicule
and
jeering
to
those
all
around
us
14
You
make
us
an
object
of
scorn
among
the
nations
Something
for
the
peoples
to
shake
their
heads
at
15
I
feel
humiliated
all
day
long
And
I
am
overwhelmed
by
my
shame
16
On
account
of
the
sound
of
their
taunts
and
insults
Because
of
our
enemy
who
is
taking
revenge
17
All
of
this
has
come
upon
us
yet
we
have
not
forgotten
you
And
we
have
not
violated
your
covenant
18
Our
heart
has
not
deviated
Our
footsteps
do
not
stray
from
your
path
19
But
you
have
crushed
us
where
the
jackals
dwell
You
have
covered
us
with
deep
shadow
20
If
we
have
forgotten
the
name
of
our
GodOr
if
we
spread
out
our
hands
in
prayer
to
a
foreign
god
21
Will
not
God
discover
this
He
is
aware
of
the
secrets
of
the
heart
22
For
your
sake
we
are
being
put
to
death
all
day
long
We
have
been
accounted
as
sheep
for
slaughtering
23
Rouse
yourself
Why
do
you
keep
sleeping
O
Jehovah
Awake
Do
not
keep
casting
us
off
forever
24
Why
do
you
hide
your
face
Why
do
you
forget
our
affliction
and
our
oppression
25
For
we
have
been
brought
down
to
the
dust
Our
bodies
are
pressed
to
the
ground
26
Rise
up
as
our
helper
Rescue
us
because
of
your
loyal
love
To
the
director

to
The
Lilies
Of
the

Korah
Maskil
A
song
of
love
45
My
heart
is
stirred
by
something
good
I
say
My
song
is
about
a
king
May
my
tongue
be
the
stylus
of
a
skilled
copyist

2
You
are
the
most
handsome
of
the
sons
of
men
Gracious
speech
flows
from
your
lips
That
is
why
God
has
blessed
you
forever

3
Strap
your
sword
on
your
side
O
mighty
one
In
your
dignity
and
your
splendor

4
And
in
your
splendor
go
on
to
victory
Ride
in
the
cause
of
truth
and
humility
and
righteousness
And
your
right
hand
will
accomplish
awe-inspiring
things

5
Your
arrows
are
sharp
making
peoples
fall
before
you
They
pierce
the
hearts
of
the
kings
enemies

6
God
is
your
throne
forever
and
ever
The
scepter
of
your
kingdom
is
a
scepter
of
uprightness

7
You
loved
righteousness
and
you
hated
wickedness
That
is
why
God
your
God
has
anointed
you
with
the
oil
of
exultation
more
than
your
companions

8
All
your
garments
are
scented
with
myrrh
and
aloeswood
and
cassia
From
the
grand
ivory
palace
stringed
instruments
make
you
rejoice

9
The
daughters
of
kings
are
among
your
ladies
of
honor
The
royal
consort
has
taken
her
stand
at
your
right
hand
adorned
in
gold
of
Ophir
10
Listen
O
daughter
pay
attention
and
incline
your
ear
Forget
your
people
and
your
fathers
house
11
And
the
king
will
long
for
your
beauty
For
he
is
your
lord
So
bow
down
to
him
12
The
daughter
of
Tyre
will
come
with
a
gift
The
wealthiest
of
men
will
seek
your
favor
13
Inside
the
palace
the
kings
daughter
is
absolutely
magnificent
Her
clothing
is
adorned
with
gold
14
She
will
be
brought
to
the
king
in
richly
woven
garments
The
virgin
companions
following
her
are
brought
in
before
you
15
They
will
be
brought
with
rejoicing
and
joy
They
will
enter
into
the
kings
palace
16
Your
sons
will
take
the
place
of
your
forefathers
You
will
appoint
them
as
princes
in
all
the
earth
17
I
will
make
your
name
known
throughout
all
generations
to
come
That
is
why
peoples
will
praise
you
forever
and
ever

God
is

A
help
that
is
readily
found
in
times
of
distress

2
That
is
why
we
will
not
fear
though
the
earth
undergoes
change
Though
the
mountains
topple
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
3
Though
its
waters
roar
and
foam
over
Though
the
mountains
rock
on
account
of
its
turbulence
Selah

There
is
a
river
the
streams

which
make
the

God
rejoice
The
holy
grand

5
God
is
in
the
city
it
cannot
be
overthrown
God
will
come
to
its
aid
at
the
break
of
dawn

6
The
nations
were
in
an
uproar
the
kingdoms
were
overthrown
He
raised
his
voice
and
the
earth
melted

7
Jehovah
of
armies
is
with
us
The
God
of
Jacob
is
our
secure
refuge
Selah

8
Come
and
witness
the
activities
of
Jehovah
How
he
has
done
astonishing
things
on
the
earth

9
He
is
bringing
an
end
to
wars
throughout
the
earth
He
breaks
the
bow
and
shatters
the
spear
He
burns
the
military
wagons
with
fire
10
Give
in
and
know
that
I
am
God
I
will
be
exalted
among
the
nations
I
will
be
exalted
in
the

For

He

The
pride

48
Jehovah
is
great
and
most
worthy
of
praiseIn
the
city
of
our
God
in
his
holy
mountain

2
Beautiful
in
its
loftiness
the
joy
of
the
whole
earth
Is
Mount
Zion
in
the
far
north
The
city
of
the
Grand
King

3
In
her
fortified
towers
God
has
made
known
that
he
is
a
secure
refuge

4
For
look
kings
have
assembled
Together
they
have
advanced

5
When
they
saw
it
they
were
amazed
They
panicked
and
fled
in
terror

6
Trembling
seized
them
there
Anguish
like
that
of
a
woman
giving
birth

7
With
an
east
wind
you
wreck
the

Tarshish

What
we
heard
about
we
have
now
seen
for
ourselvesIn
the
city
of
Jehovah
of

in
the
city
of
our
God
God
will
firmly
establish
it
forever
Selah

9
We
ponder
your
loyal
love
O
God
Within
your
temple
10
Like
your
name
O
God
your
praiseReaches
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
Your
right
hand
is
filled
with
righteousness
11
May
Mount
Zion
rejoice
May
the
towns
of
Judah
be
joyful
because
of
your
judgments
12
March
around
Zion
go
all
around
it
Count
its
towers
13
Set
your
hearts
upon
its
ramparts
Inspect
its
fortified
towers
So
that
you
may
tell
about
it
to
future
generations
14
For
this
God
is
our
God
forever
and
ever
He
will
guide
us
forevermore
To
the
director
Of
the
sons
of
Korah
A
melody
49
Hear
this
all
you
peoples
Pay
attention
all
you
inhabitants
of
the
world
2
Both
small
and
great
Rich
and
poor
alike

3
My
own
mouth
will
speak
wisdom
And
the
meditation
of
my
heart
will
show
understanding

4
I
will
pay
attention
to
a
proverb
I
will
expound
my
riddle
with
the
harp

5
Why
should
I
fear
during
times
of
trouble
When
I
am
surrounded
by
the
evil
of
those
trying
to
overthrow
me

6
Those
who
are
trusting
in
their
wealthAnd
who
boast
about
their
great
riches
7
None
of
them
can
ever
redeem
a
brotherOr
give
to
God
a
ransom
for
him
8
The
ransom
price
for
their
life
is
so
preciousThat
it
is
always
beyond
their
reach
9
That
he
should
live
forever
and
not
see
the
pit
10
He
sees
that
even
wise
people
die
The
stupid
and
the
unreasoning
perish
together
And
they
must
leave
their
wealth
to
others
11
Their
inner
wish
is
that
their
houses
will
last
forever
Their
tents
to
generation
after
generation
They
have
named
their
estates
after
themselves
12
But
man
although
honored
will
not
remain
He
is
no
better
than
the
beasts
that
perish
13
This
is
the
way
of
the
stupid
onesAnd
of
those
who
follow
them
who
take
pleasure
in
their
empty
words
Selah
14
They
are
assigned
like
sheep
to
the
Grave
Death
will
shepherd
them
The
upright
will
rule
over
them
in
the
morning
Every
trace
of
them
will
fade
away
The
Grave
rather
than
a
palace
will
be
their
home
15
But
God
will
redeem
me
from
the
power
of
the
Grave
For
he
will
take
hold
of
me
Selah
16
Do
not
be
afraid
because
a
man
becomes
rich
Because
the
splendor
of
his
house
increases
17
For
when
he
dies
he
can
take
nothing
with
him
His
splendor
will
not
go
down
with
him
18
For
during
his
lifetime
he
congratulates
himself
People
praise
you
when
you
prosper
19
But
he
finally
joins
the
generation
of
his
forefathers
They
will
never
again
see
the
light
20
A
man
who
does
not
understand
this
although
honored
Is
no
better
than
the
beasts
that
perish
A
melody
of
Asaph
50
The
God
of
gods
Jehovah
has
spoken
He
summons
the
earthFrom
the
rising
of
the
sun
until
its
setting

2
Out
of
Zion
the
perfection
of
beauty
God
shines
forth

3
Our
God
will
come
and
cannot
remain
silent
Before
him
is
a
consuming
fire
And
a
great
storm
rages
all
around
him

4
He
summons
the
heavens
above
and
the
earth
So
as
to
judge
his
people

5
Gather
to
me
my
loyal
ones
Those
making
a
covenant
with
me
over
sacrifice

6
The
heavens
proclaim
his
righteousness
For
God
himself
is
Judge
Selah

7
Listen
O
my
people
and
I
will
speak
Israel
I
will
bear
witness
against
you
I
am
God
your
God

8
I
do
not
reprove
you
because
of
your
sacrifices
Nor
because
of
your
whole
burnt
offerings
that
are
constantly
before
me

9
I
do
not
need
to
take
a
bull
from
your
house
Nor
goats
from
your
pens
10
For
every
wild
animal
of
the
forest
is
mine
Even
the
beasts
upon
a
thousand
mountains
11
I
know
every
bird
of
the
mountains
The
countless
animals
of
the
field
are
mine
12
If
I
were
hungry
I
would
not
tell
you
For
the
productive
land
and
everything
in
it
is
mine
13
Will
I
eat
the
flesh
of
bullsAnd
drink
the
blood
of
goats
14
Offer
thanksgiving
as
your
sacrifice
to
God
And
pay
your
vows
to
the
Most
High
15
Call
on
me
in
the
time
of
distress
I
will
rescue
you
and
you
will
glorify
me
16
But
God
will
say
to
the
wicked
What
right
do
you
have
to
relate
my
regulationsOr
to
speak
about
my
covenant
17
For
you
hate
discipline
And
you
keep
turning
your
back
on
my
words
18
When
you
see
a
thief
you
approve
of
him
And
you
keep
company
with
adulterers
19
You
use
your
mouth
to
spread
what
is
bad
And
deception
is
attached
to
your
tongue
20
You
sit
and
speak
against
your
own
brother
You
reveal
the
faults
of
your
own
mothers
son
21
When
you
did
these
things
I
remained
silent
So
you
thought
that
I
would
be
just
like
you
But
now
I
will
reprove
you
And
I
will
state
my
case
against
you
22
Please
consider
this
you
who
forget
God
So
that
I
may
not
tear
you
to
pieces
with
no
one
to
rescue
you
23
The
one
who
offers
thanksgiving
as
his
sacrifice
glorifies
me
And
as
for
the
one
who
follows
a
set
course
I
will
cause
him
to
see
salvation
by
God
To
the
director
A
melody
of
David
when
Nathan
the
prophet
came
in
to
him
after
David
had
relations
with
Bath-sheba
51
Show
me
favor
O
God
according
to
your
loyal
love
Blot
out
my
transgressions
according
to
your
great
mercy

2
Thoroughly
wash
me
from
my
error
And
cleanse
me
from
my
sin

3
For
I
am
well-aware
of
my
transgressions
And
my
sin
is
always
before
me

4
Against
you—you
above
all—I
have
sinned
What
is
bad
in
your
eyes
I
have
done
Therefore
you
are
righteous
when
you
speak
You
are
right
in
your
judgment

5
Look
I
was
born
guilty
of
error
And
my
mother
conceived
me
in
sin

6
Look
You
find
pleasure
in
truth
in
the
inner
person
Teach
my
innermost
self
true
wisdom

7
Purify
me
from
my
sin
with
hyssop
so
that
I
will
be
clean
Wash
me
so
that
I
will
be
whiter
than
snow

8
Let
me
hear
sounds
of
joy
and
rejoicing
So
that
the
bones
you
crushed
will
rejoice

9
Turn
your
face
away
from
my
sins
And
wipe
away
all
my
errors
10
Create
in
me
a
pure
heart
O
God
And
put
within
me
a
new
spirit
a
steadfast
one
11
Do
not
cast
me
out
from
your
presence
And
do
not
take
your
holy
spirit
away
from
me
12
Restore
to
me
the
joy
of
your
salvation
Stir
within
me
a
willingness
to
obey
you
13
I
will
teach
transgressors
your
ways
So
that
sinners
will
return
to
you
14
Save
me
from
bloodguilt
O
God
the
God
of
my
salvation
So
that
my
tongue
may
joyfully
declare
your
righteousness
15
O
Jehovah
open
my
lips
So
that
my
mouth
may
declare
your
praise
16
For
you
do
not
want
a
sacrifice—otherwise
I
would
give
it
You
do
not
find
delight
in
a
whole
burnt
offering
17
The
sacrifices
pleasing
to
God
are
a
broken
spirit
A
heart
broken
and
crushed
O
God
you
will
not
reject
18
In
your
goodwill
do
what
is
good
for
Zion
Build
up
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
19
Then
you
will
take
delight
in
the
sacrifices
of
righteousness
The
burnt
sacrifices
and
the
whole
offerings
Then
bulls
will
be
offered
up
on
your
altar
To

Maskil
Of
David

Doeg
the

came
and

52
Why
do
you
boast
about
your
evil
acts
you
mighty
one
The
loyal
love
of
God
lasts
all
day
long

2
Your
tongue
as
sharp
as
a

Schemes
harm
and
works
deceitfully

3
You
love
evil
more
than
what
is
good
Lying
more
than
speaking
what
is
right
Selah

4
You
love
every
harmful
word
O
you
deceitful
tongue

5
That
is
why
God
will
pull
you
down
once
and
for
all
He
will
snatch
you
up
and
tear
you
away
from
your
tent
He
will
uproot
you
from
the
land
of
the
living
Selah

6
The
righteous
ones
will
see
it
and
be
filled
with
awe
And
they
will
laugh
at
him

7
Here
is
a
man
who
did
not
make
God
his
refuge
But
he
trusted
in
his
great
richesAnd
relied
on
his
own
evil
plots

8
But
I
will
be
like
a
luxuriant
olive
tree
in
Gods
house
My
trust
is
in
Gods
loyal
love
forever
and
ever

9
I
will
praise
you
forever
because
you
have
taken
action
In
the
presence
of
your
loyal
ones
I
will
hope
in
your
name
for
it
is
good
To
the
director
in
the
style
of
Mahalath
Maskil
Of
David
53
The
foolish
one
says
in
his
heart
There
is
no
Jehovah
Their
unrighteous
actions
are
corrupt
and
detestable
No
one
is
doing
good

2
But
God
looks
down
from
heaven
on
the
sons
of
menTo
see
whether
anyone
has
insight
whether
anyone
is
seeking
Jehovah

3
They
have
all
turned
away
They
are
all
alike
corrupt
No
one
is
doing
good
Not
even
one

4
Do
none
of
the
wrongdoers
understand
They
devour
my
people
as
if
they
were
eating
bread
They
do
not
call
on
Jehovah

5
But
they
will
be
filled
with
great
terror
Terror
they
have
never
felt
before
For
God
will
scatter
the
bones
of
those
attacking
you
You
will
put
them
to
shame
for
Jehovah
has
rejected
them

6
O
that
Israels
salvation
may
come
from
Zion
When
Jehovah
gathers
back
his
captive
people
Let
Jacob
be
joyful
let
Israel
rejoice
To
the
director

Maskil

the
Ziphites
came

to
Saul
David
is
hiding
among
us
54
O
God
save
me
by
your
name
And
defend
me
with
your
power

2
O
God
hear
my
prayer
Pay
attention
to
the
words
of
my
mouth

3
For
strangers
rise
up
against
me
And
ruthless
men
seek
my
life
They
have
no
regard
for
God
Selah

4
Look
God
is
my
helper
Jehovah
is
with
those
supporting
me

5
He
will
repay
my
foes
with
their
own
evil
In
your
faithfulness
put
an
end
to
them

6
I
will
sacrifice
to
you
willingly
I
will
praise
your
name
O
Jehovah
for
it
is
good

7
For
he
saves
me
from
every
distress
And
I
will
look
in
triumph
on
my
enemies
To
the
director
to
be
accompanied

stringed
instruments
Maskil

55
Listen
to
my
prayer
O
God
And
do
not
ignore
my
request
for
mercy

2
Do
pay
attention
to
me
and
answer
me
My
concern
makes
me
restless
And
I
am
distraught
3
Because
of
what
the
enemy
is
sayingAnd
the
pressure
from
the
wicked
one
For
they
heap
trouble
upon
me
And
in
anger
they
harbor
animosity
against
me

4
My
heart
is
in
anguish
within
me
And
the
terrors
of
death
overwhelm
me

5
Fear
and
trembling
come
upon
me
And
shuddering
grips
me

6
I
keep
saying
If
only
I
had
wings
like
a
dove
I
would
fly
away
and
reside
in
safety

7
Look
I
would
flee
far
away
I
would
lodge
in
the
wilderness
Selah

8
I
would
hurry
to
a
place
of
shelterAway
from
the
raging
wind
away
from
the
storm

9
Confuse
them
O
Jehovah
and
frustrate
their
plans
For
I
have
seen
violence
and
conflict
in
the
city
10
Day
and
night
they
walk
around
on
its
walls
Within
it
are
malice
and
trouble
11
Ruin
is
in
its
midst
Oppression
and
deception
never
depart
from
its
public
square
12
For
it
is
not
an
enemy
who
taunts
me
Otherwise
I
could
put
up
with
it
It
is
not
a
foe
who
has
risen
up
against
me
Otherwise
I
could
conceal
myself
from
him
13
But
it
is
you
a
man
like
me
My
own
companion
whom
I
know
well
14
We
used
to
enjoy
a
warm
friendship
together
Into
the
house
of
God
we
used
to
walk
along
with
the
multitude
15
May
destruction
overtake
them
Let
them
go
down
alive
into
the
Grave
For
evil
resides
among
them
and
within
them
16
As
for
me
I
will
call
out
to
God
And
Jehovah
will
save
me
17
Evening
and
morning
and
noontime
I
am
troubled
and
I
groan
And
he
hears
my
voice
18
He
will
rescue
me
and
give
me
peace
from
those
fighting
against
me
For
multitudes
come
against
me
19
God
will
hear
and
respond
to
them
The
one
who
sits
enthroned
from
of
old
Selah
They
will
refuse
to
change
Those
who
have
not
feared
God
20
He
attacked
those
at
peace
with
him
He
violated
his
covenant
21
His
words
are
smoother
than
butter
But
conflict
is
in
his
heart
His
words
are
softer
than
oil
But
they
are
drawn
swords
22
Throw
your
burden
on
Jehovah
And
he
will
sustain
you
Never
will
he
allow
the
righteous
one
to
fall
23
But
you
O
God
will
bring
them
down
to
the
deepest
pit
Those
bloodguilty
and
deceitful
men
will
not
live
out
half
their
days
But
as
for
me
I
will
trust
in
you
To
the

Of

Miktam
When
the
Philistines
captured
him
in

56
Show
me
favor
O
God
because
mortal
man
is
attacking
me
All
day
long
they
keep
fighting
and
oppressing
me

2
My
foes
keep
snapping
at
me
all
day
long
Many
arrogantly
fight
against
me

3
When
I
am
afraid
I
put
my
trust
in
you

4
In
God—whose
word
I
praise—In
God
I
put
my
trust
I
am
not
afraid
What
can
mere
man
do
to
me

5
All
day
long
they
hurt
my
interests
Their
only
thought
is
to
harm
me

6
They
conceal
themselves
to
attack
They
watch
my
every
step
Hoping
to
take
away
my
life

7
Reject
them
because
of
their
wickedness
Bring
down
the
nations
in
your
anger
O
God

8
You
keep
track
of
my
wandering
Do
collect
my
tears
in
your
skin
bottle
Are
they
not
recorded
in
your
book

9
My
enemies
will
retreat
on
the
day
that
I
call
for
help
Of
this
I
am
confident
God
is
on
my
side
10
In
God—whose
word
I
praise—In
Jehovah—whose
word
I
praise—11
In
God
I
put
my
trust
I
am
not
afraid
What
can
a
mere
human
do
to
me
12
I
am
bound
by
my
vows
to
you
O
God
I
will
offer
you
expressions
of
thanksgiving
13
For
you
have
rescued
me
from
deathAnd
prevented
my
feet
from
stumbling
So
that
I
may
walk
before
God
in
the
light
of
the
living
To
the

When

57
Show

favor
O
God
show
me
favor
For
I
take
refuge
in
you
And
in
the
shadow
of
your
wings
I
take
refuge
until
the
troubles
pass

2
I
call
to
God
the
Most
High
To
the
true
God
who
brings
them
to
an
end
for
me

3
He
will
send
help
from
heaven
and
save
me
He
will
frustrate
the
one
snapping
at
me
Selah
God
will
send
his
loyal
love
and
his
faithfulness

4
I
am
surrounded
by
lions
I
must
lie
among
men
who
want
to
devour
me
Whose
teeth
are
spears
and
arrowsAnd
whose
tongue
is
a
sharp
sword

5
Be
exalted
above
the
heavens
O
God
May
your
glory
be
over
all
the
earth

6
They
have
prepared
a
net
to
ensnare
my
feet
I
am
bowed
down
with
distress
They
have
dug
a
pit
ahead
of
me
But
they
fell
into
it
themselves
Selah

7
My
heart
is
steadfast
O
God
My
heart
is
steadfast
I
will
sing
and
make
music

8
Do
awake
my
glory
Do
awake
O
stringed
instrument
you
too
O
harp
I
will
awaken
the
dawn

9
I
will
praise
you
among
the
peoples
O
Jehovah
I
will
sing
praises
to
you
among
the
nations
10
For
your
loyal
love
is
great
as
high
as
the
heavens
And
your
faithfulness
up
to
the
skies
11
Be
exalted
above
the

O
God
May
your
glory
be
over
all
the
earth
To
the
director
set
to

Not

Of

Miktam
58
Can
you
speak
about
righteousness
when
you
are
silent
Can
you
judge
in
uprightness
you
sons
of
men

2
Instead
you
devise
unrighteousness
in
your
heart
And
your
hands
dispense
violence
in
the
land

3
The
wicked
go
astray
from
birth
They
are
wayward
liars
from
the
time
they
are
born

4
Their
venom
is
like
the
venom
of
serpents
They
are
deaf
like
the
cobra
that
stops
up
its
ear

5
It
will
not
listen
to
the
voice
of
charmers
No
matter
how
skillful
their
spells

6
O
God
knock
the
teeth
out
of
their
mouth
Break
the
jaws
of
these
lions
O
Jehovah

7
May
they
disappear
like
waters
that
drain
away
May
He
bend
his
bow
and
make
them
fall
by
his
arrows

8
May
they
be
like
a
snail
that
melts
away
as
it
moves
along
Like
a
womans
stillborn
child
who
never
sees
the
sun

9
Before
your
cooking
pots
feel
the
heat
of
the
bramble
He
will
sweep
away
both
the
moist
and
the
burning
twig
as
in
a
storm
wind
10
The
righteous
one
will
rejoice
because
he
has
seen
the
vengeance
His
feet
will
be
drenched
with
the
blood
of
the
wicked
11
Then
men
will
say
Surely
there
is
a
reward
for
the
righteous
There
is
indeed
a
God
who
judges
in
the
earth
To
the

Rescue

O

Protect
me
from

2
Rescue
me
from
those
who
act
wickedly
And
save

from

3
Look
They
wait
to
ambush
me
Strong
men
attack
meBut
not
because
I
have
revolted
or
sinned
O
Jehovah

4
Though
I
did
no
wrong
they
run
and

Do
arise
at
my
calling
and
see

5
For
you
O
Jehovah
God
of
armies
are
the
God

Awake
to
turn
your
attention
to
all
the
nations
Do
not
show
mercy
to
any
malicious
traitors
Selah

6
They
return
each
evening
They
growl
like
dogs
and
prowl
around
the
city

7
Look
what
pours
forth
from
their
mouth
Their
lips
are
like
swords
For
they
say
Who
is
listening

8
But
you
O
Jehovah
will
laugh
at
them
You
will
scoff
at
all
the
nations

9
O
my
Strength
I
will
keep
watch
for
you
For
God
is
my

10
The
God
who
shows
loyal
love
to

will
come
to
my
aid
God
will
cause
me
to
look
in
triumph
on
my
foes
11
Do
not
kill
them
so
that
my
people
may
not
forget
By
your
power
make
them
wander
about
Cause
their
downfall
O
Jehovah
our
shield
12
For
the
sin
of
their
mouth
the
word
of
their
lips
May
they
be
trapped
by
their
pride
Because
of
the
cursing
and
deception
that
they
speak
13
Finish
them
off
in
your
wrath
Finish
them
off
so
that
they
are
no
more
Make
them
know
that
God
is
ruling
in
Jacob
and
to
the
ends

the

Selah
14
Let
them
return
in

evening
Let
them
growl

prowl

Let

wander
about
for
something
to
eat
Do
not
let

be
satisfied
or
find
a
lodging

16
But
as
for
me
I
will
sing
about
your

In
the
morning
I
will
joyfully
tell
about

For
you
are

a

17
O

60
O
God
you
rejected

you
broke
through

You
were
angry
with

but
now
accept
us
back

2
You
caused
the
earth
to
quake
you
split
it
open
Repair
its
breaches
for
it
is
falling

3
You
caused
your
people
to
suffer
hardship
You
made
us
drink
wine
that
makes

stagger

4
Give
a
signal

flee

dodge
the

Selah

5
So
that
your

Save
us
with
your

answer

6
God
has
spoken
in
his
holiness
I
will
exult
I
will
give
out
Shechem
as
an
inheritance
And
I
will
measure
off
the
Valley

Succoth

7
Gilead
belongs

Manasseh
And
Ephraim
is
the
helmet

Judah
is

staff

8
Moab
is
my

Over
Edom
I
will
throw

Over
Philistia
I
will
shout
in
triumph

9
Who

Who

10
Is
it
not

O
God
who
have
rejected
us
Our
God
who
no

goes
out
with
our
armies
11
Help
us
in
our
distress
For
salvation
by
humans
is
worthless
12
By
God
we
will
gain
power
And
he
will
trample
on
our
adversaries

Hear
O

my

for
help
Do
pay
attention
to
my
prayer

2
From
the
ends
of
the

I
will
cry
out
to
youWhen
my
heart
is
in
despair
Lead
me
onto
a

that
is
higher

am

3
For
you
are
my

A
strong
tower
that
protects
me

4
I
will
be
a

in

forever
I
will
take
refuge
in
the
shelter
of
your
wings
Selah

5
For
you
O
God
have
heard
my
vows
You
have
given
me
the
inheritance
belonging
to
those
who
fear
your
name

6
You
will
add
days
to
the
life
of
the
king
And
his
years
will
be
from
generation
to
generation

7
He
will
sit
enthroned
forever
before
God
Grant
him
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
so
that
these
may
safeguard
him

8
Then
I
will
sing
praises
to
your
name
foreverAs
I
pay
my

day
after

the

A

62
Indeed
I

My

comes

2
Indeed
he
is
my
rock
and
my
salvation
my
secure
refuge
I
will
never
be
greatly
shaken

3
How
long
will
you
assault
a
man
in
order
to
murder
him
All
of
you
are
as
dangerous
as
a
leaning
wall
a
stone
wall
ready
to
collapse

4
For
they
consult
together
to
topple
him
from
his
high
position
They
take
pleasure
in
lying
With
their
mouth
they
bless
but
inside
they
are
cursing
Selah

5
Indeed
I
wait
silently
for
GodBecause
my
hope
comes
from
him

6
Indeed
he
is
my
rock
and
my
salvation
my
secure
refuge
I
will
never
be
shaken

7
Upon
God
depends
my
salvation
and
my
glory
My
strong
rock
my
refuge
is
God

8
Trust
in
him
at

O
people
Pour
out
your
hearts
before
him
God
is
a
refuge
for
us
Selah

The
sons
of
men
are
a
mere
breath
The
sons
of
mankind
are
a
delusion
When
laid
together
on
the
scales
they
are
lighter
than
a
mere
breath
10
Do
not
trust
in
extortionOr
put
false
hopes
in
robbery
If
your
wealth
increases
do
not
set
your
heart
on
it
11
Once
God
has
spoken
twice
I
have
heard
this
That
strength
belongs
to
God
12
Also
loyal
love
is
yours
O
Jehovah
For
you
repay
each
one
according
to
his
deeds
A
melody
of
David
when
he
was
in
the
wilderness
of
Judah
63
O
God
you
are
my
God
I
keep
looking
for
you
I
do
thirst
for
you
I
am
faint
with
longing
for
youIn
a
dry
and
parched
land
where
there
is
no
water

2
So
I
have
looked
upon
you
in
the
holy
place
I
have
seen
your
strength
and
your
glory

3
Because
your
loyal
love
is
better
than
life
My
own
lips
will
glorify
you

4
Thus
I
will
praise
you
all
my
life
In
your
name
I
will
lift
up
my
hands

5
I
am
satisfied
with
the
best
and
choicest
portion
So
my
mouth
will
praise
you
with
joy
on
my
lips

6
I
remember
you
while
upon
my
bed
I
meditate
on
you
during
the
watches
of
the
night

7
For
you
are
my
helper
And
I
shout
joyfully
in
the
shadow
of
your
wings

8
I
cling
to
you
Your
right
hand
keeps
fast
hold
on
me

9
But
those
who
seek
to
destroy
my
lifeWill
descend
into
the
depths
of
the
earth
10
They
will
be
handed
over
to
the
power
of
the
sword
They
will
become
food
for
jackals
11
But
the
king
will
rejoice
in
God
Every
person
swearing
by
Him
will
exult
For
the
mouth
of
those
speaking
lies
will
be
silenced
To
the
director
A
melody
of
David
64
Hear
my
voice
O
God
as
I
plead
Safeguard
my
life
from
the
dreadfulness
of
the
enemy

2
Shield
me
from
the
secret
plots
of
wicked
men
From
the
crowd
of
wrongdoers

3
They
sharpen
their
tongue
just
like
a
sword
They
aim
their
cruel
words
like
arrows
4
To
shoot
at
the
innocent
from
their
hiding
places
They
shoot
at
him
suddenly
without
fear

5
They
hold
fast
to
their
evil
intent
They
discuss
how
to
hide
their
traps
They
say
Who
will
see
them

6
They
search
out
new
ways
of
wrongdoing
They
secretly
devise
their
shrewd
strategy
The
thinking
within
each
ones
heart
is
unfathomable

7
But
God
will
shoot
at
them
Suddenly
they
will
be
wounded
by
an
arrow

8
Their
own
tongue
will
cause
their
downfall
All
those
looking
on
will
shake
their
head

9
Then
all
men
will
become
afraid
And
they
will
proclaim
what
God
has
done
And
they
will
have
insight
into
his
deeds
10
The
righteous
one
will
rejoice
in
Jehovah
and
take
refuge
in
him
All
the
upright
in
heart
will
exult
To
the
director
A
melody
of
David
A
song
65
Praise
awaits
you
O
God
in
Zion
We
will
pay
our
vows
to
you

2
O
Hearer
of
prayer
to
you
people
of
all
sorts
will
come

3
My
errors
have
overwhelmed
me
But
you
cover
over
our
transgressions

4
Happy
is
the
one
whom
you
choose
and
bring
nearTo
reside
in
your
courtyards
We
will
be
satisfied
with
the
goodness
of
your
house
Your
holy
temple

5
You
will
answer
us
with
awe-inspiring
deeds
of
righteousness
O
God
of
our
salvation
You
are
the
Confidence
of
all
the
ends
of
the
earthAnd
of
those
distant
across
the
sea

6
You
firmly
established
the
mountains
by
your
power
You
are
clothed
with
mightiness

7
You
calm
the
raging
seas
The
crash
of
their
waves
and
the
turmoil
of
the
nations

8
The
inhabitants
of
remote
places
will
be
awestruck
by
your
signs
You
will
cause
those
from
the
sunrise
to
the
sunset
to
shout
joyfully

9
You
care
for
the
earth
Making
it
abundantly
fruitful
and
very
rich
The
stream
from
God
is
full
of
water
You
provide
grain
for
them
For
that
is
how
you
prepared
the
earth
10
You
drench
its
furrows
and
level
off
its
plowed
soil
You
soften
it
with
showers
of
rain
you
bless
its
growth
11
You
crown
the
year
with
your
goodness
Your
tracks
overflow
with
abundance
12
The
pastures
of
the
wilderness
keep
overflowing
And
the
hills
are
clothed
with
joyfulness
13
The
pastures
are
covered
with
flocks
And
the
valleys
are
carpeted
with
grain
They
shout
in
triumph
yes
they
sing
To
the
director
A
song
A

66
Shout
in
triumph
to
God
all
the

2
Sing
praises
to
his
glorious
name
Make
his
praise
glorious

3
Say
to
God
How
awe-inspiring
your
works
are
Because
of
your
great
power
Your
enemies
will
cringe
before
you

4
All
the
earth
will
bow
down
to
you
They
will
sing
praises
to
you
They
will
sing
praises
to
your
name
Selah

5
Come
and
see
the
works
of
God
His
deeds
toward
the
sons
of
men
are
awe-inspiring

6
He
changed
the
sea
into
dry
land
They
crossed
the
river
on
foot
There
we
rejoiced
in
him

7
He
rules
forever
by
his
might
His
eyes
keep
watch
on
the
nations
Those
who
are
stubborn
should
not
exalt
themselves
Selah

8
Praise
our
God
you
peoples
And
let
the
sound
of
his
praise
be
heard

9
He
preserves
us
alive
He
does
not
allow
our
feet
to
stumble
10
For
you
have
examined
us
O
God
As
silver
is
refined
so
you
have
refined
us
11
You
brought
us
into
a
hunting
net
You
put
a
crushing
burden
upon
us
12
You
allowed
mortal
man
to
ride
over
us
We
came
through
fire
and
through
water
Then
you
brought
us
to
a
place
of
relief
13
I
will
come
into
your
house
with
whole
burnt
offerings
I
will
pay
my
vows
to
you14
That
my
lips
promisedAnd
my
mouth
spoke
when
I
was
in
distress
15
I
will
offer
burnt
offerings
of
fattened
animals
to
youWith
the
smoke
of
sacrificial
rams
I
will
offer
bulls
along
with
male
goats
Selah
16
Come
and
listen
all
you
who
fear
God
And
I
will
tell
you
what
he
has
done
for
me
17
I
called
to
him
with
my
mouthAnd
glorified
him
with
my
tongue
18
If
I
had
harbored
anything
hurtful
in
my
heart
Jehovah
would
not
have
heard
me
19
But
God
did
hear
He
paid
attention
to
my
prayer
20
Praise
to
God
who
did
not
reject
my
prayerOr
withhold
his
loyal
love

me

So
that
your
way
may
be
known
throughout

Your

among
all
the

Let

The

68
Let
God
rise
up
let
his
enemies
be
scattered
And
let
those
who
hate
him
flee
from
before
him

2
As
smoke
is
driven
away
may
you
drive
them
away
As
wax
melts
before
the
fire
So
let
the
wicked
perish
before
God

3
But
let
the
righteous
rejoice
May
they
be
overjoyed
before
God
May
they
exult
with
rejoicing

Sing

Sing

the
One
riding

plains
Jah
is

Rejoice
before
him

5
A
father
of
the
fatherless
and
a
protector
of
widowsIs
God
in
his
holy
dwelling

6
God
gives
those
who
are
alone
a
home
to
dwell
in
He
leads
prisoners
out
into
prosperity
But
the
stubborn
must
live
in
a
parched
land

7
O
God
when
you
led
your
people
When
you
marched
through
the
desert
Selah

8
The
earth
quaked
Heaven
poured
down
rain
because
of
God
This
Sinai
quaked
because
of
God
the
God
of
Israel

9
You
made
it
rain
in
abundance
O
God
You
reinvigorated
your
exhausted
people
10
They
dwelled
in
your
tent
community
In
your
goodness
you
provided
for
the
poor
O
God
11
Jehovah
gives
the
command
The
women
proclaiming
the
good
news
are
a
large
army
12
The
kings
of
armies
flee
they
flee
She
who
remains
at
home
shares
in
the
spoil
13
Although
you
men
were
lying
among
the
campfires
There
will
be
the
wings
of
a
dove
covered
with
silver
With
pinions
of
fine
gold
14
When
the
Almighty
One
scattered
its
kings
Snow
fell
in
Zalmon
15
The
mountain
of
Bashan
is
a
mountain
of
God
The
mountain
of
Bashan
is
a
mountain
of
peaks
16
Why
do
you
look
with
envy
you
mountains
of
peaks
Toward
the
mountain
that
God
has
chosen
as
his
dwelling
Indeed
Jehovah
will
reside
there
forever
17
The
war
chariots
of
God
are
tens
of
thousands
thousands
upon
thousands
Jehovah
has
come
from
Sinai
into
the
holy
place
18
You
ascended
on
high
You
carried
away
captives
You
took
gifts
in
the
form
of
men
Yes
even
stubborn
ones
to
reside
among
them
O
Jah
God
19
May
Jehovah
be
praised
who
daily
carries
our
load
The
true
God
of
our
salvation
Selah
20
The
true
God
is
for
us
a
God
who
saves
And
Jehovah
the
Sovereign
Lord
provides
escape
from
death
21
Yes
God
will
smash
the
heads
of
his
enemies
The
hairy
crown
of
the
head
of
anyone
who
continues
in
his
guilt
22
Jehovah
has
said
I
will
bring
them
back
from
Bashan
I
will
bring
them
back
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
23
So
that
your
foot
may
be
awash
in
bloodAnd
the
tongue
of
your
dogs
may
have
its
portion
from
the
enemies
24
They
see
your
processions
O
God
The
processions
of
my
God
my
King
into
the
holy
place
25
The
singers
walk
in
front
the
musicians
playing
stringed
instruments
after
them
In
between
are
the
young
women
playing
tambourines
26
In
congregated
throngs
praise
God
Praise
Jehovah
you
who
are
from
the
Source
of
Israel
27
There
Benjamin
the
youngest
is
subduing
them
Also
the
princes
of
Judah
with
their
noisy
crowd
The
princes
of
Zebulun
the
princes
of
Naphtali
28
Your
God
has
decreed
that
you
will
be
strong
Show
your
strength
O
God
you
who
have
acted
in
our
behalf
29
Because
of
your
temple
at
Jerusalem
Kings
will
bring
gifts
to
you
30
Rebuke
the
wild
beasts
of
the
reeds
The
assembly
of
bulls
and
their
calves
Until
the
peoples
bow
down
bringing
pieces
of
silver
But
he
scatters
the
peoples
who
delight
in
war
31
Bronze
articles
will
be
brought
out

Cush
will
hasten

O

Sing
praises

To
the

the
ancient

Look
He
thunders
with
his

his
mighty

34
Acknowledge
Gods
strength
His
majesty
is
over
Israel
And
his
strength
is
in
the
skies
35
God
is
awe-inspiring
from
his
grand
sanctuary
He
is
the
God
of
Israel
Who
gives
strength
and
power
to
the
people
Praise
to
God
To
the

The
Lilies
Of
David
69
Save
me
O
God
for
the
waters
threaten
my
life

2
I
have
sunk
down
into
the
deep
mud
where
there
is
no
solid
ground
I
have
come
into
deep
waters
And
the
rushing
stream
has
swept
me
away

3
I
am
exhausted
from
calling
out
My
throat
has
become
hoarse
My
eyes
have
grown
weary
while
waiting
for
my
God

4
Those
hating
me
without
causeAre
more
numerous
than
the
hairs
of
my
head
Those
who
would
do
away
with
me
My
treacherous
enemies
have
become
many
I
was
forced
to
hand
over
what
I
had
not
stolen

5
O
God
you
are
aware
of
my
foolishness
And
my
guilt
is
not
hidden
from
you

6
May
those
hoping
in
you
not
be
put
to
shame
because
of
me
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
May
those
seeking
you
not
be
humiliated
because
of
me
O
God
of
Israel

7
I
suffer
reproach
on
your
account
Humiliation
covers
my
face

8
I
have
become
a
stranger
to
my
brothers
A
foreigner
to
the
sons
of
my
mother

9
Zeal
for
your
house
has
consumed
me
And
the
reproaches
of
those
reproaching
you
have
fallen
upon
me
10
When
I
humbled
myself
with
fasting
I
was
reproached
for
it
11
When
I
made
sackcloth
my
clothing
I
became
an
object
of
scorn
to
them
12
I
am
the
talk
of
those
sitting
in
the
city
gate
And
the
drunkards
make
me
the
subject
of
their
songs
13
But
may
my
prayer
come
to
you
O
Jehovah
at
an
acceptable
time
In
your
abundant
loyal
love
O
God
Answer
me
with
your
sure
acts
of
salvation
14
Rescue
me
from
the
mire
Do
not
let
me
sink
down
Rescue
me
from
those
who
hate
meAnd
from
the
deep
waters
15
Do
not
let
the
rushing
floodwaters
sweep
me
away
Or
let
the
deep
swallow
me
Or
let
the
well
close
its
mouth
over
me
16
Answer
me
O
Jehovah
for
your
loyal
love
is
good
According
to
your
abundant
mercy
turn
toward
me
17
And
do
not
hide
your
face
from
your
servant
Answer
me
quickly
for
I
am
in
distress
18
Come
near
to
me
and
rescue
me
Redeem
me
on
account
of
my
enemies
19
You
know
my
reproach
and
my
disgrace
and
my
humiliation
You
see
all
my
foes
20
Reproach
has
broken
my
heart
and
the
wound
is
incurable
I
was
hoping
for
sympathy
but
there
was
none
And
for
comforters
but
I
found
none
21
But
for
food
they
gave
me
poison
And
for
my
thirst
they
gave
me
vinegar
to
drink
22
Let
their
table
become
a
trap
for
them
And
their
prosperity
a
snare
23
Let
their
eyes
become
darkened
so
that
they
cannot
see
And
make
their
hips
tremble
constantly
24
Pour
out
upon
them
your
indignation
And
may
your
burning
anger
overtake
them
25
Let
their
encampment
become
desolate
Let
there
be
no
inhabitant
in
their
tents
26
For
they
pursue
the
one
whom
you
struck
And
they
keep
recounting
the
pains
of
those
you
wounded
27
Add
more
guilt
to
their
guilt
And
may
they
have
no
share
in
your
righteousness
28
Let
them
be
erased
from
the
book
of
the
living
And
may
they
not
be
enrolled
among
the
righteous
29
But
I
am
afflicted
and
in
pain
May
your
saving
power
O
God
protect
me
30
I
will
sing
praises
to
the
name
of
God
And
I
will
magnify
him
with
thanksgiving
31
This
will
please
Jehovah
more
than
a
bull
More
than
a
young
bull
with
horns
and
hooves
32
The
meek
will
see
it
and
rejoice
You
who
are
seeking
God
may
your
hearts
revive
33
For
Jehovah
is
listening
to
the
poor
And
he
will
not
despise
his
captive
people
34
Let
heaven
and
earth
praise
him
The
seas
and
everything
that
moves
in
them
35
For
God
will
save
ZionAnd
will
rebuild
the
cities
of
Judah
And
they
will
dwell
there
and
possess
it
36
The
descendants
of
his
servants
will
inherit
it
And
those
who
love
his
name
will
reside
in
it
To
the
director
Of
David
to
serve
as
a
reminder
70
O
God
save
me
O
Jehovah
hurry
to
help
me

2
May
those
seeking
to
take
my
lifeBe
put
to
shame
and
disgraced
May
those
who
delight
in
my
calamityRetreat
in
humiliation

3
May
those
who
are
saying
Aha
Aha
Be
driven
back
in
shame

4
But
let
those
who
are
seeking
youExult
and
rejoice
in
you
May
those
who
love
your
acts
of
salvation
always
say
May
God
be
magnified

5
But
I
am
helpless
and
poor
O
God
act
quickly
in
my
behalf
You
are
my
helper
and
my
rescuer
O
Jehovah
do
not
delay
1
In
you
O
Jehovah
I
have
taken
refuge
May
I
never
be
put
to
shame

2
In
your
righteousness
save
me
and
rescue
me
Incline
your
ear
to
me
and
save
me

3
Become
for
me
a
rock
fortressWhere
I
can
always
enter
Give
the
command
to
save
me
For
you
are
my
crag
and
my
stronghold

4
O
my
God
rescue
me
from
the
hand
of
the
wicked
From
the
grasp
of
the
unjust
oppressor

5
For
you
are
my
hope
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
I
have
trusted
in
you
since
my
youth

6
I
have
depended
on
you
from
birth
It
was
you
who
took
me
from
my
mothers
womb
I
praise
you
constantly

7
I
have
become
like
a
miracle
to
many
But
you
are
my
strong
refuge

8
My
mouth
is
filled
with
your
praise
All
day
long
I
tell
about
your
splendor

9
Do
not
cast
me
off
in
my
old
age
Do
not
abandon
me
when
my
strength
fails
10
My
enemies
speak
against
me
And
those
seeking
to
take
my
life
conspire
together
11
Saying
God
has
abandoned
him
Chase
after
him
and
seize
him
for
there
is
no
one
to
save
him
12
O
God
do
not
remain
far
away
from
me
O
my
God
hurry
to
help
me
13
May
those
who
are
resisting
meBe
put
to
shame
and
perish
May
those
seeking
my
calamityBe
covered
with
disgrace
and
humiliation
14
But
as
for
me
I
will
continue
to
wait
I
will
add
to
your
praise
15
My
mouth
will
recount
your
righteousness
All
day
long
your
acts
of
salvation
Though
they
are
too
many
for
me
to
grasp
16
I
will
come
and
tell
about
your
mighty
acts
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
I
will
mention
your
righteousness
yours
alone
17
O
God
you
have
taught
me
from
my
youth
And
until
now
I
keep
declaring
your
wonderful
works
18
Even
when
I
am
old
and
gray
O
God
do
not
abandon
me
Let
me
tell
the
next
generation
about
your
powerAnd
about
your
mightiness
to
all
those
who
are
to
come
19
Your
righteousness
O
God
reaches
to
the
heights
You
have
done
great
things
O
God
who
is
like
you
20
Though
you
have
made
me
experience
much
distress
and
calamity
Revive
me
again
Bring
me
up
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
21
May
you
increase
my
greatnessAnd
surround
and
comfort
me
22
Then
I
will
praise
you
on
a
stringed
instrumentBecause
of
your
faithfulness
O
my
God
I
will
sing
your
praises
with
the
harp
O
Holy
One
of
Israel
23
My
lips
will
shout
joyfully
as
I
sing
praises
to
you
For
you
have
saved
my
life
24
My
tongue
will
speak
about
your
righteousness
all
day
long
For
those
seeking
my
destruction
will
be
ashamed
and
disgraced
Regarding
Solomon
72
O
God
give
your
judgments
to
the
king
And
endow
the
son
of
the
king
with
your
righteousness

2
May
he
plead
the
cause
of
your
people
with
righteousness
And
of
your
lowly
ones
with
justice

3
May
the
mountains
bring
peace
to
the
people
And
may
the
hills
bring
righteousness

4
Let
him
defend
the
lowly
among
the
people
Let
him
save
the
sons
of
the
poor
And
let
him
crush
the
defrauder

5
They
will
fear
you
as
long
as
there
is
a
sunAnd
as
long
as
the
moon
remains
For
generation
after
generation

6
He
will
be
like
the
rain
that
falls
on
the
mown
grass
Like
showers
of
rain
that
water
the
earth

7
In
his
days
the
righteous
will
flourish
And
peace
will
abound
until
the
moon
is
no
more

8
He
will
have
subjects
from
sea
to
seaAnd
from
the
River
to
the
ends
of
the
earth

9
The
desert
dwellers
will
bow
down
before
him
And
his
enemies
will
lick
the
dust
10
The
kings
of
Tarshish
and
of
the
islands
will
pay
tribute
The
kings
of
Sheba
and
of
Seba
will
present
gifts
11
All
the
kings
will
bow
down
before
him
And
all
the
nations
will
serve
him
12
For
he
will
rescue
the
poor
who
cry
for
help
Also
the
lowly
one
and
whoever
has
no
helper
13
He
will
have
pity
on
the
lowly
and
the
poor
And
the
lives
of
the
poor
he
will
save
14
From
oppression
and
from
violence
he
will
rescue
them
And
their
blood
will
be
precious
in
his
eyes
15
May
he
live
and
be
given
the
gold
of
Sheba
May
prayers
be
said
for
him
continually
And
may
he
be
blessed
all
day
long
16
There
will
be
an
abundance
of
grain
on
the
earth
On
the
top
of
the
mountains
it
will
overflow
His
fruit
will
flourish
as
in
Lebanon
And
in
the
cities
people
will
blossom
like
the
vegetation
of
the
earth
17
May
his
name
endure
forever
And
may
it
prosper
as
long
as
the
sun
May
people
obtain
a
blessing
for
themselves
by
means
of
him
May
all
nations
pronounce
him
happy
18
May
Jehovah
God
be
praised
Israels
God
Who
alone
does
wonderful
things
19
May
his
glorious
name
be
praised
forever
And
may
his
glory
fill
the
whole
earth
Amen
and
Amen
20
This
completes
the
prayers
of
David
the
son
of
Jesse
A
melody
of
Asaph
73
God
is
truly
good
to
Israel
to
those
pure
in
heart

2
As
for
me
my
feet
had
almost
strayed
My
steps
had
nearly
slipped

3
For
I
became
envious
of
the
arrogantWhen
I
would
see
the
peace
of
the
wicked

4
For
they
have
no
pain
in
their
death
Their
bodies
are
healthy

5
They
are
not
troubled
like
other
humans
Nor
do
they
suffer
like
other
men

6
Therefore
haughtiness
is
their
necklace
Violence
clothes
them
as
a
garment

7
Their
prosperity
makes
their
eyes
bulge
They
have
exceeded
the
imaginations
of
the
heart

8
They
scoff
and
say
evil
things
They
arrogantly
threaten
oppression

9
They
speak
as
if
they
were
as
high
as
heaven
And
their
tongues
swagger
about
in
the
earth
10
So
his
people
turn
aside
to
them
And
they
drink
from
their
abundant
water
11
They
say
How
does
God
know
Does
the
Most
High
really
have
knowledge
12
Yes
these
are
the
wicked
who
always
have
it
easy
They
keep
increasing
their
wealth
13
Surely
in
vain
I
have
kept
my
heart
pureAnd
washed
my
hands
in
innocence
14
And
I
was
troubled
all
day
long
Every
morning
I
was
chastised
15
But
if
I
had
said
these
things
I
would
have
betrayed
your
people
16
When
I
tried
to
understand
it
It
was
troubling
to
me17
Until
I
entered
the
grand
sanctuary
of
God
And
I
discerned
their
future
18
Surely
you
place
them
on
slippery
ground
You
make
them
fall
to
their
ruin
19
How
suddenly
they
are
devastated
How
sudden
is
their
finish
as
they
come
to
a
terrible
end
20
Like
a
dream
when
one
wakes
up
O
Jehovah
When
you
rouse
yourself
you
will
dismiss
their
image
21
But
my
heart
was
sour
And
deep
inside
I
felt
sharp
pain
22
I
was
unreasoning
and
lacked
understanding
I
was
like
a
senseless
beast
before
you
23
But
now
I
am
continually
with
you
You
have
taken
hold
of
my
right
hand
24
You
guide
me
with
your
advice
And
afterward
you
will
lead
me
to
glory
25
Whom
do
I
have
in
the
heavens
And
besides
you
I
desire
nothing
on
earth
26
My
body
and
my
heart
may
fail
But
God
is
the
rock
of
my
heart
and
my
portion
forever
27
Truly
those
keeping
far
from
you
will
perish
You
will
put
an
end
to
everyone
who
immorally
leaves
you
28
But
as
for
me
drawing
near
to
God
is
good
for
me
I
have
made
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
my
refuge
To
declare
all
your
works
A
maskil
Of
Asaph
74
Why
O
God
have
you
rejected
us
forever
Why
does
your
anger
burn
against
the
flock
of
your
pasture

2
Remember
the
people
you
acquired
long
ago
The
tribe
you
redeemed
as
your
inheritance
Remember
Mount
Zion
where
you
have
resided

3
Direct
your
steps
to
the
perpetual
ruins
The
enemy
has
devastated
everything
in
the
holy
place

4
Your
foes
roared
inside
your
meeting
place
They
have
set
up
their
own
banners
as
signs
there

5
They
were
like
men
wielding
axes
against
a
thick
forest

6
They
broke
up
all
its
engravings
with
axes
and
iron
bars

7
They
set
your
sanctuary
on
fire
They
profaned
the
tabernacle
bearing
your
name
casting
it
to
the
ground

8
They
and
their
offspring
have
said
in
their
hearts
All
the
meeting
places
of
God
in
the
land
must
be
burned

9
There
are
no
signs
for
us
to
see
There
is
no
longer
any
prophet
And
no
one
among
us
knows
how
long
this
will
last
10
How
long
O
God
will
the
adversary
keep
taunting
Will
the
enemy
treat
your
name
with
disrespect
forever
11
Why
do
you
hold
back
your
hand
your
right
hand
Draw
it
out
of
your
bosom
and
put
an
end
to
them
12
But
God
is
my
King
from
long
ago
The
one
performing
acts
of
salvation
on
the
earth
13
You
stirred
up
the
sea
with
your
strength
You
smashed
the
heads
of
the
sea
monsters
in
the
waters
14
You
crushed
the
heads
of
Leviathan
You
gave
it
as
food
to
the
people
to
those
inhabiting
the
deserts
15
You
cut
openings
for
the
springs
and
the
streams
You
dried
up
ever-flowing
rivers
16
The
day
belongs
to
you
also
the
night
You
made
the
light
and
the
sun
17
You
set
up
all
the
boundaries
of
the
earth
You
made
summer
and
winter
18
Remember
the
enemys
taunts
O
Jehovah
How
a
foolish
people
treats
your
name
with
disrespect
19
Do
not
surrender
the
life
of
your
turtledove
to
the
wild
beasts
Do
not
forget
the
life
of
your
afflicted
people
forever
20
Remember
the
covenant
For
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
have
become
full
of
the
haunts
of
violence
21
May
the
crushed
one
not
turn
away
disappointed
May
the
lowly
and
the
poor
praise
your
name
22
Rise
up
O
God
and
plead
your
legal
case
Remember
how
the
foolish
taunt
you
all
day
long
23
Do
not
forget
what
your
foes
are
saying
The
uproar
of
those
who
defy
you
is
ascending
constantly
To
the
director
Set
to
the
melody
Do
Not
Bring
to
Ruin
Of
Asaph
A
song
75
We
give
thanks
to
you
O
God
we
give
thanks
to
you
Your
name
is
near
And
people
declare
your
wondrous
works

2
You
say
When
I
set
a
time
I
judge
with
fairness

3
When
the
earth
and
all
its
inhabitants
were
dissolved
It
was
I
who
kept
its
pillars
firm
Selah

4
I
say
to
the
boastful
Do
not
boast

And
to
the
wicked
Do
not
exalt
your
strength

5
Do
not
exalt
your
strength
up
highOr
speak
with
arrogance

6
For
exaltation
does
not
comeFrom
the
east
or
the
west
or
the
south

7
For
God
is
Judge
He
puts
one
man
down
and
exalts
another

8
For
there
is
a
cup
in
Jehovahs
hand
The
wine
is
foaming
and
is
fully
mixed
He
will
surely
pour
it
out
And
all
the
wicked
of
the
earth
will
drink
it
down
to
the
dregs

9
But
as
for
me
I
will
proclaim
it
forever
I
will
sing
praises
to
the
God
of
Jacob
10
For
he
says
I
will
cut
off
all
the
strength
of
the
wicked
But
the
strength
of
the
righteous
will
be
exalted
To
the
director
to
be
accompanied
with
stringed
instruments
A
melody
of
Asaph
A
song
76
God
is
known
in
Judah
In
Israel
his
name
is
great

2
His
shelter
is
in
Salem
And
his
dwelling
is
in
Zion

3
There
he
broke
the
flaming
arrows
of
the
bow
The
shield
and
the
sword
and
the
weapons
of
war
Selah

4
You
shine
brightly
You
are
more
majestic
than
the
mountains
of
prey

5
The
courageous
of
heart
have
been
plundered
They
have
fallen
asleep
The
warriors
were
all
helpless

6
From
your
rebuke
O
God
of
Jacob
Both
the
charioteer
and
the
horse
have
fallen
fast
asleep

7
You
alone
are
awe-inspiring
Who
can
withstand
your
intense
anger

8
From
heaven
you
pronounced
judgment
The
earth
was
afraid
and
was
silent
9
When
God
rose
up
to
execute
judgment
To
save
all
the
meek
of
the
earth
Selah
10
For
the
rage
of
man
will
serve
to
your
praise
With
the
remnants
of
their
rage
you
will
adorn
yourself
11
Make
your
vows
to
Jehovah
your
God
and
pay
them
Let
all
who
are
around
him
bring
their
gift
in
fear
12
He
will
humble
the
pride
of
leaders
He
inspires
fear
in
the
kings
of
the
earth
To
the
director
on
Jeduthun
Of
Asaph
A
melody
77
With
my
voice
I
will
cry
out
to
God
To
God
I
will
cry
out
and
he
will
hear
me

2
In
the
day
of
my
distress
I
search
for
Jehovah
At
night
my
hands
are
stretched
out
to
him
without
ceasing
I
cannot
be
comforted

3
When
I
remember
God
I
groan
I
am
troubled
and
my
strength
fails
Selah

4
You
hold
my
eyelids
open
I
am
agitated
and
cannot
speak

5
My
thoughts
turn
to
the
days
of
long
ago
The
years
of
the
distant
past

6
During
the
night
I
remember
my
song
I
ponder
in
my
heart
I
make
a
diligent
search

7
Will
Jehovah
cast
us
off
forever
Will
he
never
again
show
his
favor

8
Has
his
loyal
love
ceased
forever
Will
his
promise
come
to
nothing
for
all
generations

9
Has
God
forgotten
to
show
his
favor
Or
has
his
anger
caused
his
mercy
to
cease
Selah
10
Must
I
keep
saying
This
is
what
distresses
me
The
Most
High
has
changed
his
position
toward
us
11
I
will
remember
the
works
of
Jah
I
will
remember
your
marvelous
deeds
of
long
ago
12
And
I
will
meditate
on
all
your
activityAnd
ponder
over
your
dealings
13
O
God
your
ways
are
holy
What
god
is
as
great
as
you
O
God
14
You
are
the
true
God
who
does
marvelous
things
You
have
revealed
your
strength
to
the
peoples
15
With
your
power
you
have
rescued
your
people
The
sons
of
Jacob
and
of
Joseph
Selah
16
The
waters
saw
you
O
God
The
waters
saw
you
and
were
disturbed
And
the
deep
waters
became
agitated
17
The
clouds
poured
down
water
The
cloudy
skies
thundered
And
your
arrows
flew
here
and
there
18
The
sound
of
your
thunder
was
like
chariot
wheels
Flashes
of
lightning
lit
up
the
inhabited
earth
The
earth
trembled
and
quaked
19
Your
way
was
through
the
sea
Your
path
through
many
waters
But
your
footprints
could
not
be
traced
20
You
led
your
people
just
like
a
flock
In
the
care
of
Moses
and
Aaron
Maskil
Of
Asaph
78
Listen
my
people
to
my
law
Incline
your
ear
to
the
words
of
my
mouth

2
I
will
open
my
mouth
in
a
proverb
I
will
propound
riddles
of
long
ago

3
The
things
we
have
heard
and
know
Which
our
fathers
have
related
to
us
4
We
will
not
hide
from
their
sons
We
will
relate
to
the
generation
to
comeThe
praiseworthy
deeds
of
Jehovah
and
his
strength
The
wonderful
things
he
has
done

5
He
established
a
reminder
in
JacobAnd
set
a
law
in
Israel
He
commanded
our
forefathersTo
make
these
things
known
to
their
children
6
So
that
the
next
generation
The
children
yet
to
be
born
might
know
them
They
in
turn
would
relate
them
to
their
children

7
Then
these
would
put
their
confidence
in
God
They
would
not
forget
Gods
worksBut
would
observe
his
commandments

8
Then
they
would
not
be
like
their
forefathers
A
stubborn
and
rebellious
generation
A
generation
whose
heart
was
unsteadyAnd
whose
spirit
was
not
faithful
to
God

9
The
Ephraimites
were
armed
with
the
bow
But
they
retreated
in
the
day
of
battle
10
They
did
not
keep
the
covenant
of
GodAnd
refused
to
walk
in
his
law
11
They
also
forgot
what
he
had
done
His
wonderful
works
that
he
showed
them
12
He
did
marvelous
things
in
the
sight
of
their
forefathers
In
the
land
of
Egypt
the
region
of
Zoan
13
He
split
the
sea
to
let
them
pass
through
And
he
made
the
waters
stand
up
like
a
dam
14
He
led
them
with
a
cloud
by
dayAnd
the
whole
night
with
the
light
of
a
fire
15
He
split
rocks
in
the
wilderness
He
let
them
drink
their
fill
as
if
from
deep
waters
16
He
brought
streams
out
of
a
cragAnd
caused
waters
to
flow
down
like
rivers
17
But
they
continued
to
sin
against
himBy
rebelling
against
the
Most
High
in
the
desert
18
They
challenged
God
in
their
heartBy
demanding
food
that
they
craved
19
So
they
spoke
against
God
Saying
Can
God
spread
a
table
in
the
wilderness
20
Look
He
struck
a
rockSo
that
waters
flowed
and
streams
flooded
out
Can
he
also
give
us
bread
Or
can
he
provide
meat
for
his
people
21
When
Jehovah
heard
them
he
became
furious
A
fire
blazed
against
Jacob
And
his
anger
flared
up
against
Israel22
Because
they
did
not
put
faith
in
God
They
did
not
trust
in
his
ability
to
save
them
23
So
he
commanded
the
cloudy
skies
above
And
he
opened
the
doors
of
heaven
24
He
kept
raining
down
manna
for
them
to
eat
He
gave
them
the
grain
of
heaven
25
Men
ate
the
bread
of
mighty
ones
He
provided
enough
to
satisfy
them
26
He
stirred
up
the
east
wind
in
the
heavensAnd
made
a
south
wind
blow
by
his
power
27
And
he
rained
down
meat
on
them
like
dust
Birds
like
the
sand
of
the
seashore
28
He
made
them
fall
in
the
midst
of
his
camp
All
around
his
tents
29
And
they
ate
and
gorged
themselves
He
gave
them
what
they
desired
30
But
before
they
fully
satisfied
their
craving
While
their
food
was
yet
in
their
mouth
31
Gods
wrath
flared
up
against
them
He
put
to
death
their
strongest
men
He
brought
down
the
young
men
of
Israel
32
Despite
this
they
sinned
even
moreAnd
did
not
put
faith
in
his
wonderful
works
33
So
he
brought
their
days
to
an
end
as
if
a
mere
breath
And
their
years
by
sudden
terrors
34
But
as
often
as
he
killed
them
they
would
search
for
him
They
would
return
and
look
for
God
35
Remembering
that
God
was
their
RockAnd
that
the
Most
High
God
was
their
Redeemer
36
But
they
tried
to
deceive
him
with
their
mouthAnd
lied
to
him
with
their
tongue
37
Their
heart
was
not
steadfast
toward
him
And
they
were
not
faithful
to
his
covenant
38
But
he
was
merciful
He
would
forgive
their
error
and
not
bring
them
to
ruin
He
often
held
back
his
angerInstead
of
stirring
up
all
his
wrath
39
For
he
remembered
that
they
were
flesh
A
wind
that
blows
past
and
does
not
return
40
How
often
they
rebelled
against
him
in
the
wildernessAnd
made
him
feel
hurt
in
the
desert
41
Again
and
again
they
put
God
to
the
test
And
they
grieved
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
42
They
did
not
remember
his
power
The
day
that
he
rescued
them
from
the
adversary
43
How
he
displayed
his
signs
in
EgyptAnd
his
miracles
in
the
region
of
Zoan
44
And
how
he
turned
the
Nile
canals
into
bloodSo
that
they
could
not
drink
from
their
streams
45
He
sent
swarms
of
gadflies
to
devour
themAnd
frogs
to
bring
them
to
ruin
46
He
gave
their
crops
to
the
voracious
locusts
The
fruit
of
their
labor
to
the
swarming
locusts
47
He
destroyed
their
vines
with
hailAnd
their
sycamore
trees
with
hailstones
48
He
gave
their
beasts
of
burden
over
to
the
hailAnd
their
livestock
to
the
lightning
bolts
49
He
inflicted
his
burning
anger
on
them
Fury
and
indignation
and
distress
Companies
of
angels
bringing
calamity
50
He
cleared
a
pathway
for
his
anger
He
did
not
spare
them
from
death
And
he
gave
them
over
to
pestilence
51
Finally
he
struck
down
all
the
firstborn
of
Egypt
The
beginning
of
their
procreative
power
in
the
tents
of
Ham
52
Then
he
brought
his
people
out
like
a
flockAnd
guided
them
like
a
drove
in
the
wilderness
53
He
led
them
in
security
And
they
felt
no
fear
The
sea
covered
their
enemies
54
And
he
brought
them
to
his
holy
territory
This
mountainous
region
that
his
right
hand
acquired
55
He
drove
out
the
nations
from
before
them
He
allotted
to
them
an
inheritance
by
the
measuring
line
He
settled
the
tribes
of
Israel
in
their
homes
56
But
they
kept
challenging
God
the
Most
High
and
rebelling
against
him
They
did
not
pay
attention
to
his
reminders
57
They
also
turned
away
and
were
as
treacherous
as
their
forefathers
They
were
as
unreliable
as
a
loose
bow
58
They
kept
offending
him
with
their
high
places
And
they
incited
him
to
fury
with
their
carved
images
59
God
heard
and
became
furious
So
he
utterly
rejected
Israel
60
He
finally
forsook
the
tabernacle
of
Shiloh
The
tent
where
he
had
resided
among
men
61
He
let
the
symbol
of
his
strength
go
into
captivity
His
splendor
into
the
hand
of
the
adversary
62
He
handed
his
people
over
to
the
swordAnd
became
furious
with
his
inheritance
63
Fire
consumed
his
young
men
And
to
his
virgins
no
wedding
songs
were
sung
64
His
priests
fell
by
the
sword
And
their
own
widows
did
not
weep
65
Then
Jehovah
woke
up
as
from
sleep
Like
a
mighty
man
waking
up
from
wine
66
And
he
drove
his
adversaries
back
He
put
them
to
lasting
disgrace
67
He
rejected
the
tent
of
Joseph
He
did
not
choose
the
tribe
of
Ephraim
68
But
he
chose
the
tribe
of
Judah
Mount
Zion
which
he
loves
69
He
made
his
sanctuary
as
enduring
as
the
heavens
Like
the
earth
that
he
has
established
forever
70
He
chose
David
his
servantAnd
took
him
from
the
sheep
pens
71
From
tending
the
nursing
ewes
He
made
him
the
shepherd
over
Jacob
his
people
And
over
Israel
his
inheritance
72
He
shepherded
them
with
integrity
of
heart
And
with
skillful
hands
he
led
them
A
melody
of
Asaph
79
O
God
the
nations
have
invaded
your
inheritance
They
have
defiled
your
holy
temple
They
have
turned
Jerusalem
into
a
heap
of
ruins

2
They
have
given
the
dead
bodies
of
your
servants
as
food
to
the
birds
of
the
heavensAnd
the
flesh
of
your
loyal
ones
to
the
wild
beasts
of
the
earth

3
They
have
poured
out
their
blood
like
water
around
Jerusalem
And
no
one
is
left
to
bury
them

4
We
have
become
an
object
of
reproach
to
our
neighbors
Those
around
us
ridicule
and
jeer
us

5
How
long
O
Jehovah
will
you
be
furious
Forever
How
long
will
your
indignation
burn
just
like
fire

6
Pour
out
your
wrath
on
the
nations
that
do
not
know
youAnd
on
the
kingdoms
that
do
not
call
on
your
name

7
For
they
have
devoured
JacobAnd
have
desolated
his
homeland

8
Do
not
hold
us
accountable
for
the
errors
of
our
ancestors
Quickly
show
us
your
mercy
For
we
have
been
brought
very
low

9
Help
us
O
God
of
our
salvation
For
the
sake
of
your
glorious
name
Rescue
us
and
forgive
our
sins
for
the
sake
of
your
name
10
Why
should
the
nations
say
Where
is
their
God
Before
our
eyes
may
it
become
known
among
the
nationsThat
the
shed
blood
of
your
servants
has
been
avenged
11
May
you
hear
the
sighing
of
the
prisoner
Use
your
great
power
to
preserve
those
sentenced
to
death
12
Repay
our
neighbors
sevenfoldFor
the
taunts
they
have
leveled
at
you
O
Jehovah
13
Then
we
your
people
and
the
flock
of
your
pasture
Will
give
thanks
to
you
forever
And
we
will
declare
your
praise
from
generation
to
generation
To
the
director
set
to
The
Lilies
A
reminder
Of
Asaph
A
melody
80
O
Shepherd
of
Israel
listen
You
who
are
guiding
Joseph
just
like
a
flock
You
who
sit
enthroned
above
the
cherubs
Shine
forth

2
Before
Ephraim
and
Benjamin
and
Manasseh
Do
stir
up
your
mightiness
Come
and
save
us

3
O
God
restore
us
Let
your
face
shine
upon
us
so
that
we
may
be
saved

4
Jehovah
God
of
armies
how
long
will
you
be
hostile
toward
the
prayer
of
your
people

5
You
feed
them
tears
as
their
bread
And
you
make
them
drink
tears
beyond
measure

6
You
let
our
neighbors
quarrel
over
us
Our
enemies
keep
mocking
us
as
they
please

7
O
God
of
armies
restore
us
Let
your
face
shine
upon
us
so
that
we
may
be
saved

8
You
made
a
vine
depart
from
Egypt
You
drove
out
the
nations
and
planted
it

9
You
cleared
a
space
for
it
And
it
took
root
and
filled
the
land
10
The
mountains
were
covered
by
its
shadow
And
the
cedars
of
God
by
its
branches
11
Its
branches
reached
as
far
as
the
sea
And
its
shoots
to
the
River
12
Why
have
you
broken
down
the
stone
walls
of
the
vineyard
So
that
all
those
passing
by
pluck
its
fruit
13
The
boars
of
the
forest
ravage
it
And
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
feed
on
it
14
O
God
of
armies
please
return
Look
down
from
heaven
and
see
Take
care
of
this
vine
15
The
stock
that
your
right
hand
has
planted
And
look
upon
the
son
whom
you
made
strong
for
yourself
16
It
is
burned
with
fire
cut
down
They
perish
at
your
rebuke
17
May
your
hand
give
support
to
the
man
at
your
right
hand
To
the
son
of
man
you
have
made
strong
for
yourself
18
Then
we
will
not
turn
away
from
you
Preserve
us
alive
so
that
we
may
call
on
your
name
19
O
Jehovah
God
of
armies
restore
us
Let
your
face
shine
upon
us
so
that
we
may
be
saved
To
the
director
upon
the
Gittith
Of
Asaph
81
Shout
joyfully
to
God
our
strength
Shout
in
triumph
to
the
God
of
Jacob

2
Begin
the
music
and
take
a
tambourine
The
melodious
harp
together
with
the
stringed
instrument

3
Blow
the
horn
on
the
new
moon
On
the
full
moon
for
the
day
of
our
festival

4
For
it
is
a
decree
for
Israel
A
ruling
of
the
God
of
Jacob

5
He
established
it
as
a
reminder
for
JosephWhen
He
went
out
against
the
land
of
Egypt
I
heard
a
voice
that
I
did
not
recognize

6
I
lifted
the
burden
from
his
shoulder
His
hands
were
freed
from
the
basket

7
In
your
distress
you
called
and
I
rescued
you
I
answered
you
from
the
thundercloud
I
tested
you
at
the
waters
of
Meribah
Selah

8
Hear
my
people
and
I
will
testify
against
you
O
Israel
if
you
would
only
listen
to
me

9
Among
you
there
will
be
no
strange
god
And
you
will
not
bow
down
to
a
foreign
god
10
I
Jehovah
am
your
God
The
one
who
brought
you
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
Open
your
mouth
wide
and
I
will
fill
it
11
But
my
people
did
not
listen
to
my
voice
Israel
would
not
submit
to
me
12
So
I
let
them
follow
their
stubborn
hearts
They
did
what
they
thought
was
right
13
If
only
my
people
would
listen
to
me
If
only
Israel
would
walk
in
my
ways
14
Their
enemies
I
would
quickly
subdue
I
would
turn
my
hand
against
their
adversaries
15
Those
who
hate
Jehovah
will
cringe
in
his
presence
And
their
outcome
will
be
forever
16
But
he
will
feed
you
with
the
finest
wheatAnd
satisfy
you
with
honey
from
the
rock
A
melody
of
Asaph
82
God
takes
his
place
in
the
divine
assembly
In
the
middle
of
the
gods
he
judges

2
How
long
will
you
continue
to
judge
with
injusticeAnd
show
partiality
to
the
wicked
Selah

3
Defend
the
lowly
and
the
fatherless
Render
justice
to
the
helpless
and
destitute

4
Rescue
the
lowly
and
the
poor
Save
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked

5
They
do
not
know
nor
do
they
understand
They
are
walking
about
in
darkness
All
the
foundations
of
the
earth
are
being
shaken

6
I
have
said
You
are
gods
All
of
you
are
sons
of
the
Most
High

7
But
you
will
die
just
as
men
do
And
like
any
other
prince
you
will
fall

8
Rise
up
O
God
and
judge
the
earth
For
all
the
nations
belong
to
you
A
song
A
melody
of
Asaph
83
O
God
do
not
be
silent
Do
not
keep
quiet
or
still
O
Divine
One

2
For
look
your
enemies
are
in
an
uproar
Those
who
hate
you
act
arrogantly

3
With
cunning
they
secretly
plot
against
your
people
They
conspire
against
your
treasured
ones

4
They
say
Come
let
us
annihilate
them
as
a
nation
So
that
the
name
of
Israel
may
be
remembered
no
more

5
They
devise
a
unified
strategy
They
have
made
an
alliance
against
you—
6
The
tents
of
Edom
and
the
Ishmaelites
Moab
and
the
Hagrites
7
Gebal
and
Ammon
and
Amalek
Philistia
together
with
the
inhabitants
of
Tyre

8
Assyria
too
has
joined
them
They
give
support
to
the
sons
of
Lot
Selah

9
Do
to
them
as
you
did
to
Midian
As
you
did
to
Sisera
and
Jabin
at
the
stream
of
Kishon
10
They
were
annihilated
at
En-dor
They
became
manure
for
the
ground
11
Make
their
nobles
like
Oreb
and
ZeebAnd
their
princes
like
Zebah
and
Zalmunna
12
For
they
said
Let
us
take
possession
of
the
land
where
God
dwells
13
O
my
God
make
them
like
a
whirling
thistle
Like
stubble
blown
about
by
the
wind
14
Like
a
fire
that
burns
up
the
forest
Like
a
flame
that
scorches
the
mountains
15
So
may
you
pursue
them
with
your
tempestAnd
terrify
them
with
your
windstorm
16
Cover
their
faces
with
dishonor
So
that
they
may
search
for
your
name
O
Jehovah
17
May
they
be
put
to
shame
and
be
terrified
forever
May
they
be
disgraced
and
perish
18
May
people
know
that
you
whose
name
is
Jehovah
You
alone
are
the
Most
High
over
all
the
earth
For
the
director
upon
the
Gittith
Of
the
sons
of
Korah
A
melody
84
How
lovely
your
grand
tabernacle
is
O
Jehovah
of
armies

2
My
whole
being
yearns
Yes
I
am
faint
with
longing
For
the
courtyards
of
Jehovah
My
heart
and
my
flesh
shout
joyfully
to
the
living
God

3
Even
the
bird
finds
a
home
thereAnd
the
swallow
a
nest
for
herself
Where
she
cares
for
her
youngNear
your
grand
altar
O
Jehovah
of
armies
My
King
and
my
God

4
Happy
are
those
dwelling
in
your
house
They
continue
to
praise
you
Selah

5
Happy
are
the
men
who
find
their
strength
in
you
Whose
hearts
are
set
on
the
highways

6
When
they
pass
through
the
Baca
Valley
They
make
it
into
a
place
of
springs
And
the
early
rain
clothes
it
with
blessings

7
They
will
walk
on
from
strength
to
strength
Each
one
appears
before
God
in
Zion

8
O
Jehovah
God
of
armies
hear
my
prayer
Listen
O
God
of
Jacob
Selah

9
Look
our
shield
and
our
God
Look
upon
the
face
of
your
anointed
one
10
For
a
day
in
your
courtyards
is
better
than
a
thousand
anywhere
else
I
choose
to
stand
at
the
threshold
of
the
house
of
my
GodRather
than
to
dwell
in
the
tents
of
wickedness
11
For
Jehovah
God
is
a
sun
and
a
shield
He
gives
favor
and
glory
Jehovah
will
not
hold
back
anything
goodFrom
those
walking
in
integrity
12
O
Jehovah
of
armies
Happy
is
the
man
who
trusts
in
you
For
the
director
Of
the
sons
of
Korah
A
melody
85
You
have
shown
favor
O
Jehovah
to
your
land
You
brought
back
those
of
Jacob
who
were
taken
captive

2
You
have
pardoned
the
error
of
your
people
You
forgave
all
their
sin
Selah

3
You
held
back
all
your
fury
You
turned
away
from
your
hot
anger

4
Restore
us
O
God
of
our
salvation
And
set
aside
your
displeasure
with
us

5
Will
you
be
furious
with
us
forever
Will
you
prolong
your
anger
to
generation
after
generation

6
Will
you
not
revive
us
againSo
that
your
people
may
rejoice
in
you

7
Show
your
loyal
love
to
us
O
Jehovah
And
grant
us
your
salvation

8
I
will
listen
to
what
the
true
God
Jehovah
says
For
he
will
speak
peace
to
his
people
to
his
loyal
ones
But
let
them
not
return
to
overconfidence

9
Surely
his
salvation
is
near
to
those
who
fear
him
So
that
his
glory
may
reside
in
our
land
10
Loyal
love
and
faithfulness
will
meet
together
Righteousness
and
peace
will
kiss
each
other
11
Faithfulness
will
sprout
from
the
earth
And
righteousness
will
look
down
from
the
heavens
12
Yes
Jehovah
will
give
what
is
good
And
our
land
will
yield
its
harvest
13
Righteousness
will
walk
before
himAnd
make
a
path
for
his
footsteps
A
prayer
of
David
86
Incline
your
ear
O
Jehovah
and
answer
me
For
I
am
afflicted
and
poor

2
Guard
my
life
for
I
am
loyal
Save
your
servant
who
is
trusting
in
you
For
you
are
my
God

3
Show
me
favor
O
Jehovah
For
I
call
to
you
all
day
long

4
Make
your
servant
rejoice
For
to
you
O
Jehovah
I
turn

5
For
you
O
Jehovah
are
good
and
ready
to
forgive
You
abound
in
loyal
love
for
all
those
who
call
on
you

6
Listen
O
Jehovah
to
my
prayer
And
pay
attention
to
my
pleas
for
help

7
I
call
on
you
in
the
day
of
my
distress
For
you
will
answer
me

8
There
is
none
like
you
among
the
gods
O
Jehovah
There
are
no
works
like
yours

9
All
the
nations
that
you
madeWill
come
and
bow
down
before
you
O
Jehovah
And
they
will
give
glory
to
your
name
10
For
you
are
great
and
do
wondrous
things
You
are
God
you
alone
11
Instruct
me
O
Jehovah
about
your
way
I
will
walk
in
your
truth
Unify
my
heart
to
fear
your
name
12
I
praise
you
O
Jehovah
my
God
with
all
my
heart
And
I
will
glorify
your
name
forever
13
For
your
loyal
love
toward
me
is
great
And
you
have
saved
my
life
from
the
depths
of
the
Grave
14
O
God
presumptuous
men
rise
up
against
me
A
band
of
ruthless
men
seek
to
take
my
life
And
they
have
no
regard
for
you
15
But
you
O
Jehovah
are
a
God
merciful
and
compassionate
Slow
to
anger
and
abundant
in
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
16
Turn
to
me
and
show
me
favor
Give
your
strength
to
your
servant
And
save
the
son
of
your
slave
girl
17
Show
me
a
sign
of
your
goodness
So
that
those
who
hate
me
may
see
it
and
be
put
to
shame
For
you
O
Jehovah
are

helper
and
comforter

than

3
Glorious
things
are
being
said
about
you
O

4
I
will
count
Rahab

Babylon
among

Here
are
Philistia

Tyre
together
with
Cush
It
will
be
said
This
is
one
who
was
born
there

5
And
about
Zion
it
will
be
said
Each
and
every
one
was
born
in
her
And
the
Most
High
will
firmly
establish
her

6
Jehovah
will
declare
when
recording
the
peoples
This
is
one
who
was
born
there

O
Jehovah
the
God
of
my
salvation
By
day
I
cry
out
And
by
night
I
come
before
you

2
Let
my
prayer
come
to
you
Incline
your
ear
to
my
cry
for
help

3
For
my
soul
has
been
filled
with
calamity
And
my
life
is
on
the
brink
of
the
Grave

4
I
am
already
counted
among
those
going
down
to
the
pit
I
have
become
a
helpless
man
5
Left
among
the
deadLike
the
slain
lying
in
a
grave
Whom
you
remember
no
longerAnd
who
have
been
separated
from
your
care

6
You
have
put
me
in
the
lowest
pit
In
dark
places
in
a
large
abyss

7
Your
rage
weighs
heavily
on
me
And
you
overwhelm
me
with
your
crashing
waves
Selah

8
You
have
driven
my
acquaintances
far
away
from
me
You
have
made
me
something
detestable
to
them
I
am
trapped
and
cannot
escape

9
My
eye
is
worn
out
because
of
my
affliction
I
call
on
you
O
Jehovah
all
day
long
To
you
I
spread
out
my
hands
10
Will
you
perform
wonders
for
the
dead
Can
those
powerless
in
death
rise
up
to
praise
you
Selah
11
Will
your
loyal
love
be
declared
in
the
grave
Your
faithfulness
in
the
place
of
destruction
12
Will
your
wonders
be
known
in
the
darknessOr
your
righteousness
in
the
land
of
oblivion
13
But
I
still
cry
to
you
for
help
O
Jehovah
Each
morning
my
prayer
comes
before
you
14
Why
O
Jehovah
do
you
reject
me
Why
do
you
hide
your
face
from
me
15
From
my
youth
on
I
have
been
afflicted
and
ready
to
perish
I
am
numb
from
the
terrible
things
you
allow
me
to
suffer
16
Your
burning
anger
overwhelms
me
Your
terrors
destroy
me
17
They
surround
me
like
waters
all
day
long
They
close
in
on
me
from
all
sides
18
You
have
driven
my
friends
and
companions
far
away
from
me
Darkness
has
become
my
companion

89
I
will
sing
about
Jehovahs
expressions
of
loyal
love
forever
With
my

I
will
make
known
your
faithfulness
to
all
generations

2
For
I
have
said
Loyal
love
will
be
built
up
forever
And
you
have
firmly
established
your
faithfulness
in
the
heavens

3
I
have
made
a
covenant
with
my
chosen
one
I
have
sworn
to
David
my
servant

4
I
will
firmly
establish
your
offspring
forever
And
I
will
build
up
your
throne
for
all

Selah

5
The
heavens
praise
your
marvels
O
Jehovah
Yes
your
faithfulness
in
the
congregation
of
the
holy
ones

6
For
who
in
the
skies
can
compare
to
Jehovah
Who
among
the
sons
of
God
is
like
Jehovah

7
God
is
held
in
awe
in
the
council
of
holy
ones
He
is
grand
and
awe-inspiring
to
all
who
are
around
him

8
O
Jehovah
God
of
armies
Who
is
mighty
like
you
O
Jah
Your
faithfulness
surrounds
you

9
You
rule
over
the
raging
of
the
sea
When
its
waves
surge
you
calm
them
10
You
have
crushed
Rahab
like
one
who
is
slain
With
your
strong
arm
you
have
scattered
your
enemies
11
The
heavens
are
yours
and
the
earth
is
yours
The
productive
land
and
what
fills
it—you
have
founded
them
12
The
north
and
the
south—you
created
them
Tabor
and
Hermon
joyously
praise
your
name
13
Your
arm
is
mighty
Your
hand
is
strong
Your
right
hand
is
exalted
14
Righteousness
and
justice
are
the
foundation
of
your
throne
Loyal
love
and
faithfulness
stand
before
you
15
Happy
are
the
people
who
know
the
joyful
shouting
O
Jehovah
they
walk
in
the
light
of
your
face
16
They
rejoice
in
your
name
all
day
long
And
in
your
righteousness
they
are
exalted
17
For
you
are
the
glory
of
their
strength
And
by
your
approval
our
strength
is
exalted
18
For
our
shield
belongs
to
Jehovah
Our
king
belongs
to
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
19
At
that
time
you
spoke
in
a
vision
to
your
loyal
ones
and
said
I
have
granted
strength
to
a
mighty
one
I
have
exalted
a
chosen
one
from
among
the
people
20
I
have
found
David
my
servant
With
my
holy
oil
I
have
anointed
him
21
My
hand
will
support
him
And
my
arm
will
strengthen
him
22
No
enemy
will
exact
tribute
from
him
And
no
unrighteous
man
will
oppress
him
23
I
will
crush
to
pieces
his
adversaries
from
before
himAnd
strike
down
those
who
hate
him
24
My
faithfulness
and
loyal
love
are
with
him
And
in
my
name
his
strength
will
be
exalted
25
I
will
put
his
hand
over
the
seaAnd
his
right
hand
over
the
rivers
26
He
will
call
out
to
me
You
are
my
Father
My
God
and
the
Rock
of
my
salvation
27
And
I
will
place
him
as
firstborn
The
highest
of
the
kings
of
the
earth
28
I
will
maintain
my
loyal
love
for
him
forever
And
my
covenant
with
him
will
never
fail
29
I
will
establish
his
offspring
foreverAnd
make
his
throne
as
enduring
as
the
heavens
30
If
his
sons
leave
my
lawAnd
do
not
walk
according
to
my
decrees
31
If
they
violate
my
statutesAnd
do
not
keep
my
commandments
32
Then
I
will
punish
their
disobedience
with
a
rodAnd
their
error
with
flogging
33
But
I
will
never
abandon
my
loyal
love
for
himNor
be
untrue
to
my
promise
34
I
will
not
violate
my
covenantOr
change
what
my
lips
have
spoken
35
I
have
sworn
in
my
holiness
once
and
for
all
I
will
not
tell
lies
to
David
36
His
offspring
will
endure
forever
His
throne
will
endure
like
the
sun
before
me
37
Like
the
moon
it
will
be
firmly
established
foreverAs
a
faithful
witness
in
the
skies
Selah
38
But
you
yourself
have
cast
off
and
rejected
him
You
have
become
furious
with
your
anointed
one
39
You
have
spurned
the
covenant
with
your
servant
You
have
profaned
his
crown
by
throwing
it
to
the
ground
40
You
have
broken
down
all
his
stone
walls
You
have
reduced
his
fortifications
to
ruins
41
All
who
pass
by
have
pillaged
him
He
is
a
reproach
to
his
neighbors
42
You
have
made
his
adversaries
victorious
You
have
caused
all
his
enemies
to
rejoice
43
You
have
also
driven
back
his
sword
And
you
have
made
him
lose
ground
in
the
battle
44
You
have
brought
an
end
to
his
splendorAnd
hurled
his
throne
to
the
ground
45
You
have
cut
short
the
days
of
his
youth
You
have
clothed
him
with
shame
Selah
46
How
long
O
Jehovah
will
you
hide
yourself
Will
it
be
forever
Will
your
rage
continue
to
burn
like
a
fire
47
Remember
how
short
my
life
is
Was
it
to
no
purpose
that
you
created
all
humans
48
What
man
can
live
and
never
see
death
Can
he
save
himself
from
the
power
of
the
Grave
Selah
49
Where
are
your
former
acts
of
loyal
love
O
Jehovah
That
you
swore
about
to
David
in
your
faithfulness
50
Remember
O
Jehovah
the
taunts
hurled
at
your
servants
How
I
have
to
bear
the
taunts
of
all
the
peoples
51
How
your
enemies
have
hurled
insults
O
Jehovah
How
they
have
insulted
every
footstep
of
your
anointed
one
52
May
Jehovah
be
praised
forever
Amen
and
Amen
A
prayer
of
Moses
the
man
of
the
true
God
90
O
Jehovah
you
have
been
our
dwelling
place
throughout
all
generations

2
Before
the
mountains
were
bornOr
you
brought
forth
the
earth
and
the
productive
land
From
everlasting
to
everlasting
you
are
God

3
You
make
mortal
man
return
to
dust
You
say
Return
you
sons
of
men

4
For
a
thousand
years
are
in
your
eyes
just
as
yesterday
when
it
is
past
Just
as
a
watch
during
the
night

5
You
sweep
them
away
they
become
like
mere
sleep
In
the
morning
they
are
like
grass
that
sprouts

6
In
the
morning
it
blossoms
and
is
renewed
But
by
evening
it
withers
and
dries
up

7
For
we
are
consumed
by
your
angerAnd
terrified
by
your
rage

8
You
place
our
errors
in
front
of
you
Our
secrets
are
exposed
by
the
light
of
your
face

9
Our
days
ebb
away
because
of
your
fury
And
our
years
come
to
an
end
like
a
whisper
10
The
span
of
our
life
is
70
years
Or
80
if
one
is
especially
strong
But
they
are
filled
with
trouble
and
sorrow
They
quickly
pass
by
and
away
we
fly
11
Who
can
fathom
the
power
of
your
anger
Your
fury
is
as
great
as
the
fear
you
deserve
12
Teach
us
how
to
count
our
daysSo
that
we
may
acquire
a
heart
of
wisdom
13
Return
O
Jehovah
How
long
will
this
last
Have
pity
on
your
servants
14
Satisfy
us
with
your
loyal
love
in
the
morning
So
that
we
may
shout
joyfully
and
rejoice
during
all
our
days
15
Make
us
rejoice
in
proportion
to
the
days
you
have
afflicted
us
For
as
many
years
as
we
have
experienced
calamity
16
May
your
servants
see
your
activity
And
may
their
sons
see
your
splendor
17
May
the
favor
of
Jehovah
our
God
be
upon
us
May
you
prosper
the
work
of
our
hands
Yes
prosper
the
work
of
our
hands
1
Anyone
dwelling
in
the
secret
place
of
the
Most
HighWill
lodge
under
the
shadow
of
the
Almighty

2
I
will
say
to
Jehovah
You
are
my
refuge
and
my
stronghold
My
God
in
whom
I
trust

3
For
he
will
rescue
you
from
the
trap
of
the
birdcatcher
From
the
destructive
pestilence

4
With
his
pinions
he
will
cover
you
And
under
his
wings
you
will
take
refuge
His
faithfulness
will
be
a
large
shield
and
a
protective
wall

5
You
will
not
fear
the
terrors
of
the
night
Nor
the
arrow
that
flies
by
day
6
Nor
the
pestilence
that
stalks
in
the
gloom
Nor
the
destruction
that
ravages
at
midday

7
A
thousand
will
fall
at
your
sideAnd
ten
thousand
at
your
right
hand
But
to
you
it
will
not
come
near

8
You
will
only
see
it
with
your
eyesAs
you
witness
the
punishment
of
the
wicked

9
Because
you
said
Jehovah
is
my
refuge

You
have
made
the
Most
High
your
dwelling
10
No
disaster
will
befall
you
And
no
plague
will
come
near
your
tent
11
For
he
will
give
his
angels
a
command
concerning
you
To
guard
you
in
all
your
ways
12
They
will
carry
you
on
their
hands
So
that
you
may
not
strike
your
foot
against
a
stone
13
On
the
young
lion
and
the
cobra
you
will
tread
You
will
trample
underfoot
the
maned
lion
and
the
big
snake
14
God
said
Because
he
has
affection
for
me
I
will
rescue
him
I
will
protect
him
because
he
knows
my
name
15
He
will
call
on
me
and
I
will
answer
him
I
will
be
with
him
in
distress
I
will
rescue
him
and
glorify
him
16
I
will
satisfy
him
with
long
life
And
I
will
cause
him
to
see
my
acts
of
salvation
A
melody
A
song
for
the
Sabbath
day
92
It
is
good
to
give
thanks
to
JehovahAnd
to
sing
praises
to
your
name
O
Most
High
2
To
declare
your
loyal
love
in
the
morningAnd
your
faithfulness
during
the
nights
3
Accompanied
by
a
ten-stringed
instrument
and
a
lute
By
the
melodious
sound
of
a
harp

4
For
you
have
made
me
rejoice
O
Jehovah
because
of
your
deeds
Because
of
the
works
of
your
hands
I
shout
joyfully

5
How
great
your
works
are
O
Jehovah
How
very
deep
your
thoughts
are

6
No
unreasoning
man
can
know
them
And
no
foolish
person
can
understand
this

7
When
the
wicked
sprout
like
weedsAnd
all
the
wrongdoers
flourish
It
is
that
they
may
be
annihilated
forever

8
But
you
are
exalted
forever
O
Jehovah

9
Indeed
look
in
triumph
on
your
enemies
O
Jehovah
Look
at
how
your
enemies
will
perish
All
the
wrongdoers
will
be
scattered
10
But
you
will
exalt
my
strength
like
that
of
a
wild
bull
I
will
moisten
my
skin
with
fresh
oil
11
My
eyes
will
look
in
triumph
on
my
foes
My
ears
will
hear
about
the
downfall
of
the
evil
men
who
attack
me
12
But
the
righteous
will
flourish
like
a
palm
treeAnd
grow
big
like
a
cedar
in
Lebanon
13
They
are
planted
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
They
flourish
in
the
courtyards
of
our
God
14
Even
in
old
age
they
will
still
be
thriving
They
will
remain
vigorous
and
fresh
15
Declaring
that
Jehovah
is
upright
He
is
my
Rock
in
whom
there
is
no
unrighteousness
1
Jehovah
has
become
King
With
grandeur
he
is
clothed
Jehovah
is
clothed
with
strength
He
wears
it
like
a
belt
The
earth
is
firmly
established
It
cannot
be
moved

2
Your
throne
was
firmly
established
long
ago
From
eternity
you
have
existed

3
The
rivers
have
surged
O
Jehovah
The
rivers
have
surged
and
roared
The
rivers
keep
surging
and
pounding

4
Above
the
sound
of
many
waters
Mightier
than
the
breaking
waves
of
the
sea
Jehovah
is
majestic
in
the
heights

5
Your
reminders
are
very
trustworthy
Holiness
adorns
your
house
O
Jehovah
for
all
times
1
O
God
of
vengeance
Jehovah
O
God
of
vengeance
shine
forth

2
Rise
up
O
Judge
of
the
earth
Repay
to
the
haughty
what
they
deserve

3
How
long
will
the
wicked
O
Jehovah
How
long
will
the
wicked
continue
to
exult

4
They
babble
and
speak
arrogantly
All
the
wrongdoers
brag
about
themselves

5
They
crush
your
people
O
Jehovah
And
oppress
your
inheritance

6
They
kill
the
widow
and
the
foreign
resident
And
they
murder
the
fatherless
children

7
They
say
Jah
does
not
see
The
God
of
Jacob
does
not
take
notice
of
it

8
Understand
this
you
who
are
unreasoning
You
foolish
ones
when
will
you
ever
show
insight

9
The
One
who
made
the
ear
can
he
not
hear
The
One
who
formed
the
eye
can
he
not
see
10
The
One
correcting
the
nations
can
he
not
reprove
He
is
the
One
who
imparts
knowledge
to
people
11
Jehovah
knows
the
thoughts
of
men
That
they
are
but
a
mere
breath
12
Happy
is
the
man
whom
you
correct
O
Jah
Whom
you
teach
from
your
law
13
To
give
him
tranquillity
during
days
of
calamity
Until
a
pit
is
dug
for
the
wicked
14
For
Jehovah
will
not
forsake
his
people
Nor
will
he
abandon
his
inheritance
15
For
judgment
will
once
again
be
righteous
And
all
the
upright
in
heart
will
follow
it
16
Who
will
rise
up
for
me
against
the
wicked
Who
will
take
a
stand
for
me
against
the
wrongdoers
17
If
Jehovah
had
not
been
my
helper
I
would
soon
have
perished
18
When
I
said
My
foot
is
slipping

Your
loyal
love
O
Jehovah
kept
supporting
me
19
When
anxieties
overwhelmed
me
You
comforted
and
soothed
me
20
Can
a
throne
of
corruption
be
allied
with
youWhile
it
is
framing
trouble
in
the
name
of
the
law
21
They
make
vicious
attacks
on
the
righteous
oneAnd
condemn
the
innocent
one
to
death
22
But
Jehovah
will
become
a
secure
refuge
for
me
My
God
is
my
rock
of
refuge
23
He
will
make
their
wicked
deeds
come
back
upon
them
He
will
do
away
with
them
by
means
of
their
own
evil
Jehovah
our
God
will
do
away
with
them
1
Come
let
us
shout
joyfully
to
Jehovah
Let
us
shout
in
triumph
to
our
Rock
of
salvation

2
Let
us
come
into
his
presence
with
thanksgiving
Let
us
sing
and
shout
in
triumph
to
him

3
For
Jehovah
is
a
great
God
A
great
King
over
all
other
gods

4
In
his
hand
are
the
depths
of
the
earth
The
mountain
peaks
belong
to
him

5
The
sea
which
he
made
belongs
to
him
And
his
hands
formed
the
dry
land

6
Come
let
us
worship
and
bow
down
Let
us
kneel
before
Jehovah
our
Maker

7
For
he
is
our
God
And
we
are
the
people
of
his
pasture
The
sheep
in
his
care
Today
if
you
listen
to
his
voice
8
Do
not
harden
your
heart
as
at
Meribah
As
in
the
day
of
Massah
in
the
wilderness
9
When
your
forefathers
tested
me
They
challenged
me
though
they
had
seen
my
works
10
For
40
years
I
felt
a
loathing
toward
that
generation
and
I
said
They
are
a
people
who
always
go
astray
in
their
hearts
They
have
not
come
to
know
my
ways
11
So
I
swore
in
my
anger
They
will
not
enter
into
my
rest

He
is
more
awe-inspiring
than
all
other
gods

5
All
the
gods
of
the
peoples
are
worthless
gods
But
Jehovah
is
the
one
who
made
the
heavens

6
In
his

majesty
and
splendor
Strength
and
beauty
are
in

King
Let

many
islands

Clouds
and
thick
gloom

around
him
Righteousness

the
foundation
of
his
throne

Fire
goes
before
himAnd
consumes
his
adversaries
on
every
side

6
Moses
and
Aaron
were
among
his
priests
And
Samuel
was
among
those
calling
on
his
name
They
would
call
to
Jehovah
And
he
would
answer
them

7
He
would
speak
to
them
from
the
pillar
of
cloud
They
kept
his
reminders
and
the
decree
that
he
gave
to
them

8
O
Jehovah
our
God
you
answered
them
You
were
a
God
who
pardoned
them
But
you
punished
them
for
their
sinful
deeds

For
Jehovah
is
good
His
loyal
love

forever
And
his
faithfulness
through
all
generations
Of
David
A
melody
101
I
will
sing
about
loyal
love
and
justice
To
you
O
Jehovah
I
will
sing
praises

2
I
will
act
with
discretion
and
blamelessness
When
will
you
come
to
me
I
will
walk
with
integrity
of
heart
inside
my
house

3
I
will
not
set
anything
worthless
before
my
eyes
I
hate
the
deeds
of
those
who
deviate
from
what
is
right
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them

4
A
crooked
heart
is
far
from
me
I
will
not
accept
what
is
bad

5
Anyone
slandering
his
neighbor
in
secret
I
will
silence
Anyone
with
haughty
eyes
and
an
arrogant
heart
I
will
not
tolerate

6
I
will
look
to
the
faithful
ones
of
the
earth
So
that
they
may
dwell
with
me
The
one
walking
in
blamelessness
will
minister
to
me

7
No
deceitful
person
will
dwell
in
my
house
And
no
liar
will
stand
in
my
presence

8
Every
morning
I
will
silence
all
the
wicked
of
the
earth
To
cut
off
all
wrongdoers
from
the
city
of
Jehovah
A
prayer
of
the
oppressed
one
when
he
is
in
despair
and
pours
out
his
concern
before
Jehovah
102
O
Jehovah
hear
my
prayer
Let
my
cry
for
help
reach
you

2
Do
not
hide
your
face
from
me
in
my
time
of
distress
Incline
your
ear
to
me
Do
answer
me
quickly
when
I
call

3
For
my
days
are
vanishing
like
smoke
And
my
bones
are
charred
like
a
fireplace

4
My
heart
has
been
struck
down
like
grass
and
has
withered
For
I
forget
to
eat
my
food

5
Because
of
my
loud
groaning
My
bones
cling
to
my
flesh

6
I
resemble
the
pelican
of
the
wilderness
I
am
like
a
little
owl
among
the
ruins

7
I
lie
awake
I
am
like
a
solitary
bird
on
a
roof

8
All
day
long
my
enemies
taunt
me
Those
who
mock
me
use
my
name
as
a
curse

9
For
I
eat
ashes
as
my
bread
And
my
drink
is
mingled
with
tears
10
Because
of
your
anger
and
your
indignation
For
you
lifted
me
up
only
to
cast
me
aside
11
My
days
are
like
a
fading
shadow
And
I
am
withering
like
grass
12
But
you
remain
forever
O
Jehovah
And
your
fame
will
endure
for
all
generations
13
Surely
you
will
rise
up
and
show
mercy
on
Zion
For
it
is
time
to
show
her
your
favor
The
appointed
time
has
come
14
For
your
servants
find
pleasure
in
her
stonesAnd
have
affection
even
for
her
dust
15
The
nations
will
fear
the
name
of
Jehovah
And
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
your
glory
16
For
Jehovah
will
rebuild
Zion
He
will
appear
in
his
glory
17
He
will
pay
attention
to
the
prayer
of
the
destitute
He
will
not
despise
their
prayer
18
This
is
written
for
the
future
generation
So
that
a
people
yet
to
be
brought
forth
will
praise
Jah
19
For
he
looks
down
from
his
holy
height
From
the
heavens
Jehovah
views
the
earth
20
To
hear
the
sighing
of
the
prisoner
To
release
those
sentenced
to
death
21
So
that
the
name
of
Jehovah
will
be
declared
in
ZionAnd
his
praise
in
Jerusalem
22
When
the
peoples
and
kingdomsGather
together
to
serve
Jehovah
23
He
prematurely
robbed
me
of
my
strength
He
cut
short
my
days
24
I
said
O
my
God
Do
not
do
away
with
me
in
the
middle
of
my
life
You
whose
years
span
all
generations
25
Long
ago
you
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
And
the
heavens
are
the
work
of
your
hands
26
They
will
perish
but
you
will
remain
Just
like
a
garment
they
will
all
wear
out
Just
like
clothing
you
will
replace
them
and
they
will
pass
away
27
But
you
are
the
same
and
your
years
will
never
end
28
The
children
of
your
servants
will
dwell
securely
And
their
offspring
will
be
firmly
established
before
you
Of
David
103
Let
me
praise
Jehovah
Let
everything
within
me
praise
his
holy
name

2
Let
me
praise
Jehovah
May
I
never
forget
all
that
he
has
done

3
He
forgives
all
your
errorsAnd
heals
all
your
ailments
4
He
reclaims
your
life
from
the
pitAnd
crowns
you
with
his
loyal
love
and
mercy

5
He
satisfies
you
with
good
things
all
your
life
So
that
your
youth
is
renewed
like
that
of
an
eagle

6
Jehovah
acts
with
righteousness
and
justiceFor
all
who
are
oppressed

7
He
made
known
his
ways
to
Moses
His
deeds
to
the
sons
of
Israel

8
Jehovah
is
merciful
and
compassionate
Slow
to
anger
and
abundant
in
loyal
love

9
He
will
not
always
find
fault
Nor
will
he
stay
resentful
forever
10
He
has
not
dealt
with
us
according
to
our
sins
Nor
has
he
repaid
us
what
our
errors
deserve
11
For
as
the
heavens
are
higher
than
the
earth
So
great
is
his
loyal
love
toward
those
who
fear
him
12
As
far
off
as
the
sunrise
is
from
the
sunset
So
far
off
from
us
he
has
put
our
transgressions
13
As
a
father
shows
mercy
to
his
sons
Jehovah
has
shown
mercy
to
those
who
fear
him
14
For
he
well
knows
how
we
are
formed
Remembering
that
we
are
dust
15
As
for
mortal
man
his
days
are
like
those
of
grass
He
blooms
like
a
blossom
of
the
field
16
But
when
a
wind
blows
it
is
no
more
As
though
it
was
never
there
17
But
the
loyal
love
of
Jehovah
is
for
all
eternityToward
those
who
fear
him
And
his
righteousness
toward
their
childrens
children
18
Toward
those
who
keep
his
covenantAnd
those
who
are
careful
to
observe
his
orders
19
Jehovah
has
firmly
established
his
throne
in
the
heavens
And
his
kingship
rules
over
everything
20
Praise
Jehovah
all
you
his
angels
mighty
in
power
Who
carry
out
his
word
obeying
his
voice
21
Praise
Jehovah
all
his
armies
His
ministers
who
do
his
will
22
Praise
Jehovah
all
his
works
In
all
the
places
where
he
rules
Let
my
whole
being
praise
Jehovah
1
Let
me
praise
Jehovah
O
Jehovah
my
God
you
are
very
great
With
majesty
and
splendor
you
are
clothed

2
You
are
wrapped
in
light
as
with
a
garment
You
stretch
out
the
heavens
like
a
tent
cloth

3
He
lays
beams
of
his
upper
rooms
in
the
waters
above
Making
the
clouds
his
chariot
Moving
on
the
wings
of
the
wind

4
He
makes
his
angels
spirits
His
ministers
a
consuming
fire

5
He
has
established
the
earth
on
its
foundations
It
will
not
be
moved
from
its
place
forever
and
ever

6
You
covered
it
with
deep
waters
as
with
a
garment
The
waters
stood
above
the
mountains

7
At
your
rebuke
they
fled
At
the
sound
of
your
thunder
they
ran
away
in
panic
8
—Mountains
ascended
and
valleys
descended—To
the
place
you
established
for
them

9
You
set
a
boundary
that
they
should
not
pass
That
they
should
never
again
cover
the
earth
10
He
sends
springs
into
the
valleys
Between
the
mountains
they
flow
11
They
provide
water
for
all
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
The
wild
donkeys
quench
their
thirst
12
Above
them
roost
the
birds
of
the
sky
They
sing
among
the
thick
foliage
13
He
is
watering
the
mountains
from
his
upper
rooms
With
the
fruitage
of
your
works
the
earth
is
satisfied
14
He
is
making
grass
grow
for
the
cattleAnd
vegetation
for
mankinds
use
To
grow
food
from
the
land15
And
wine
that
makes
mans
heart
rejoice
Oil
that
makes
the
face
shine
And
bread
that
sustains
the
heart
of
mortal
man
16
The
trees
of
Jehovah
are
satisfied
The
cedars
of
Lebanon
that
he
planted
17
Where
the
birds
make
nests
The
home
of
the
stork
is
in
the
juniper
trees
18
The
high
mountains
are
for
the
mountain
goats
The
crags
are
a
refuge
for
the
rock
badgers
19
He
has
made
the
moon
to
mark
the
appointed
times
The
sun
well
knows
when
to
set
20
You
bring
darkness
and
night
falls
When
all
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
roam
about
21
The
young
lions
roar
for
their
preyAnd
seek
their
food
from
God
22
When
the
sun
rises
They
withdraw
and
lie
down
in
their
dens
23
Man
goes
to
his
work
And
he
labors
until
evening
24
How
many
your
works
are
O
Jehovah
You
have
made
all
of
them
in
wisdom
The
earth
is
full
of
what
you
have
made
25
There
is
the
sea
so
great
and
wide
Teeming
with
countless
living
things
both
small
and
great
26
There
the
ships
travel
And
Leviathan
which
you
formed
to
play
in
it
27
All
of
them
wait
for
youTo
give
them
their
food
in
its
season
28
What
you
give
them
they
gather
When
you
open
your
hand
they
are
satisfied
with
good
things
29
When
you
hide
your
face
they
are
disturbed
If
you
take
away
their
spirit
they
die
and
return
to
the
dust
30
If
you
send
out
your
spirit
they
are
created
And
you
renew
the
surface
of
the
ground
31
The
glory
of
Jehovah
will
last
forever
Jehovah
will
rejoice
in
his
works
32
He
looks
at
the
earth
and
it
trembles
He
touches
the
mountains
and
they
smoke
33
I
will
sing
to
Jehovah
throughout
my
life
I
will
sing
praises
to
my
God
as
long
as
I
live
34
Let
my
thoughts
be
pleasing
to
him
I
will
rejoice
in
Jehovah
35
The
sinners
will
vanish
from
the
earth
And
the
wicked
will
no
longer
exist
Let
me
praise
Jehovah
Praise
Jah
1
Give
thanks
to
Jehovah
call
on
his
name
Make
his
deeds
known
among
the
peoples

2
Sing
to
him
sing
praises
to
him
Ponder
over
all
his
wonderful
works

3
Boast
about
his
holy
name
Let
the
hearts
of
those
seeking
Jehovah
rejoice

4
Search
for
Jehovah
and
his
strength
Seek
his
face
constantly

5
Remember
the
wonderful
works
he
has
performed
His
miracles
and
the
judgments
he
has
pronounced
6
You
offspring
of
Abraham
his
servant
You
sons
of
Jacob
his
chosen
ones

7
He
is
Jehovah
our
God
His
judgments
are
throughout
the
earth

8
He
remembers
his
covenant
forever
The
promise
he
made
to
a
thousand
generations
9
The
covenant
he
made
with
Abraham
And
the
oath
he
swore
to
Isaac
10
Which
he
established
as
a
decree
to
JacobAnd
as
a
lasting
covenant
to
Israel
11
Saying
I
will
give
you
the
land
of
CanaanAs
your
allotted
inheritance
12
This
was
when
they
were
few
in
number
Yes
very
few
and
they
were
foreigners
in
the
land
13
They
walked
about
from
nation
to
nation
From
one
kingdom
to
another
people
14
He
did
not
allow
any
man
to
oppress
them
But
on
their
account
he
reproved
kings
15
Saying
Do
not
touch
my
anointed
ones
And
to
my
prophets
do
nothing
bad
16
He
called
down
a
famine
on
the
land
He
cut
off
their
supply
of
bread
17
He
sent
ahead
of
them
a
manWho
was
sold
to
be
a
slave
Joseph
18
With
fetters
they
bound
his
feet
His
neck
was
put
in
irons
19
Until
the
time
that
his
word
proved
true
The
saying
of
Jehovah
is
what
refined
him
20
The
king
sent
to
release
him
The
ruler
of
the
peoples
set
him
free
21
He
made
him
master
of
his
household
Ruler
over
all
his
property
22
To
have
authority
over
his
princes
as
he
pleasedAnd
to
teach
his
elders
wisdom
23
Then
Israel
came
into
Egypt
And
Jacob
lived
as
a
foreigner
in
the
land
of
Ham
24
God
made
his
people
very
fruitful
He
made
them
mightier
than
their
adversaries
25
Whose
hearts
he
let
change
to
hate
his
people
To
plot
against
his
servants
26
He
sent
his
servant
Moses
And
Aaron
whom
he
had
chosen
27
They
performed
his
signs
among
them
His
miracles
in
the
land
of
Ham
28
He
sent
darkness
and
the
land
became
dark
They
did
not
rebel
against
his
words
29
He
changed
their
waters
into
bloodAnd
killed
their
fish
30
Their
land
swarmed
with
frogs
Even
in
the
royal
chambers
31
He
ordered
the
gadflies
to
invadeAnd
gnats
in
all
their
territories
32
He
turned
their
rain
to
hailAnd
sent
lightning
on
their
land
33
He
struck
their
vines
and
their
fig
treesAnd
shattered
the
trees
of
their
territory
34
He
said
that
the
locusts
should
invade
Young
locusts
without
number
35
They
devoured
all
the
vegetation
in
the
land
And
they
devoured
the
produce
of
the
ground
36
Then
he
struck
down
every
firstborn
in
their
land
The
beginning
of
their
procreative
power
37
He
brought
his
people
out
with
silver
and
gold
And
no
one
among
his
tribes
stumbled
38
Egypt
rejoiced
when
they
left
For
the
dread
of
Israel
had
fallen
on
them
39
He
spread
a
cloud
to
screen
them
off
And
fire
to
give
light
by
night
40
They
asked
and
he
brought
quail
He
kept
satisfying
them
with
bread
from
heaven
41
He
opened
a
rock
and
waters
flowed
out
These
flowed
through
the
desert
like
a
river
42
For
he
remembered
the
holy
promise
he
had
made
to
Abraham
his
servant
43
So
he
brought
out
his
people
with
exultation
His
chosen
ones
with
a
joyful
cry
44
He
gave
them
the
lands
of
nations
They
inherited
what
other
peoples
had
worked
hard
to
produce
45
So
that
they
would
keep
his
decreesAnd
observe
his
laws
Praise
Jah
1
Praise
Jah
Give
thanks
to
Jehovah
for
he
is
good
His
loyal
love
endures
forever

2
Who
can
fully
declare
Jehovahs
mighty
actsOr
proclaim
all
his
praiseworthy
deeds

3
Happy
are
those
who
act
with
justice
Who
always
do
what
is
right

4
Remember
me
O
Jehovah
when
you
show
favor
toward
your
people
Take
care
of
me
with
your
acts
of
salvation
5
So
that
I
may
enjoy
the
goodness
you
show
your
chosen
ones
That
I
may
rejoice
along
with
your
nation
That
I
may
proudly
praise
you
along
with
your
inheritance

6
We
have
sinned
just
as
our
forefathers
did
We
have
done
wrong
we
have
acted
wickedly

7
Our
forefathers
in
Egypt
did
not
appreciate
your
wonderful
works
They
did
not
remember
your
abundant
loyal
love
But
they
rebelled
at
the
sea
by
the
Red
Sea

8
But
he
saved
them
for
the
sake
of
his
name
To
make
his
mightiness
known

9
He
rebuked
the
Red
Sea
and
it
dried
up
He
led
them
through
its
depths
as
through
a
desert
10
He
saved
them
from
the
hand
of
their
foeAnd
reclaimed
them
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
11
The
waters
covered
their
adversaries
Not
one
of
them
survived
12
Then
they
had
faith
in
his
promise
They
began
to
sing
his
praise
13
But
they
quickly
forgot
what
he
did
They
did
not
wait
for
his
counsel
14
They
gave
way
to
their
selfish
desires
in
the
wilderness
They
tested
God
in
the
desert
15
He
gave
them
what
they
requested
But
then
struck
them
with
disease
that
made
them
waste
away
16
In
the
camp
they
grew
jealous
of
MosesAnd
of
Aaron
the
holy
one
of
Jehovah
17
The
earth
then
opened
up
and
swallowed
DathanAnd
covered
those
assembled
with
Abiram
18
A
fire
blazed
among
their
group
A
flame
consumed
the
wicked
19
They
made
a
calf
in
HorebAnd
bowed
down
to
a
statue
of
metal
20
They
exchanged
my
gloryFor
the
representation
of
a
grass-eating
bull
21
They
forgot
God
their
Savior
Who
did
great
things
in
Egypt
22
Wonderful
works
in
the
land
of
Ham
Awe-inspiring
deeds
at
the
Red
Sea
23
He
was
about
to
order
their
annihilation
But
Moses
his
chosen
one
interceded
with
himTo
avert
his
destructive
anger
24
Then
they
despised
the
desirable
land
They
had
no
faith
in
his
promise
25
They
kept
grumbling
in
their
tents
They
did
not
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
26
So
he
raised
his
hand
in
an
oath
concerning
themThat
he
would
make
them
fall
in
the
wilderness
27
He
would
make
their
descendants
fall
among
the
nations
And
he
would
scatter
them
throughout
the
lands
28
Then
they
joined
in
worship
of
Baal
of
Peor
And
they
ate
sacrifices
offered
to
the
dead
29
They
provoked
Him
by
their
actions
And
a
scourge
broke
out
among
them
30
But
when
Phinehas
stood
up
and
intervened
The
scourge
was
halted
31
And
it
was
counted
to
him
as
righteousnessThrough
all
generations
forever
32
They
provoked
Him
at
the
waters
of
Meribah
And
it
went
badly
for
Moses
because
of
them
33
They
embittered
his
spirit
And
he
spoke
rashly
with
his
lips
34
They
did
not
annihilate
the
peoples
As
Jehovah
had
commanded
them
35
But
they
mingled
with
the
nationsAnd
adopted
their
ways
36
They
kept
serving
their
idols
And
these
became
a
snare
to
them
37
They
would
sacrifice
their
sonsAnd
their
daughters
to
demons
38
They
kept
spilling
innocent
blood
The
blood
of
their
own
sons
and
daughtersWhom
they
sacrificed
to
the
idols
of
Canaan
And
the
land
was
polluted
with
bloodshed
39
They
became
unclean
by
their
works
They
committed
spiritual
prostitution
by
their
deeds
40
So
the
anger
of
Jehovah
blazed
against
his
people
And
he
grew
to
detest
his
inheritance
41
He
repeatedly
handed
them
over
to
the
nations
So
that
those
who
hated
them
might
rule
over
them
42
Their
enemies
oppressed
them
And
they
were
subject
to
their
power
43
Many
times
he
rescued
them
But
they
would
rebel
and
disobey
And
they
would
be
brought
low
for
their
error
44
But
he
would
see
their
distressAnd
hear
their
cry
for
help
45
For
their
sake
he
would
remember
his
covenant
And
he
would
feel
pity
moved
by
his
great
loyal
love
46
He
would
cause
them
to
be
pitiedBy
all
who
held
them
captive
47
Save
us
O
Jehovah
our
God
And
gather
us
from
the
nationsSo
that
we
may
give
thanks
to
your
holy
nameAnd
exult
in
praising
you
48
May
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
be
praisedThroughout
all
eternity
And
let
all
the
people
say
Amen
Praise
Jah
1
Give
thanks
to
Jehovah
for
he
is
good
His
loyal
love
endures
forever

2
Let
those
reclaimed
by
Jehovah
say
this
Those
whom
he
reclaimed
from
the
hand
of
the
adversary
3
Whom
he
gathered
together
from
the
lands
From
the
east
and
from
the
west
From
the
north
and
from
the
south

4
They
wandered
about
in
the
wilderness
in
the
desert
They
did
not
find
a
way
to
a
city
where
they
could
live

5
They
were
hungry
and
thirsty
They
were
faint
from
exhaustion

6
They
kept
crying
out
to
Jehovah
in
their
distress
He
rescued
them
from
their
plight

7
He
had
them
walk
in
the
right
wayTo
come
to
a
city
where
they
could
live

8
Let
people
give
thanks
to
Jehovah
for
his
loyal
loveAnd
for
his
wonderful
works
in
behalf
of
the
sons
of
men

9
For
he
has
satisfied
the
thirstyAnd
filled
the
hungry
with
good
things
10
Some
were
living
in
deepest
darkness
Prisoners
in
affliction
and
in
irons
11
For
they
had
rebelled
against
the
word
of
God
They
disrespected
the
counsel
of
the
Most
High
12
So
he
humbled
their
hearts
through
hardship
They
stumbled
and
there
was
no
one
to
help
them
13
They
called
to
Jehovah
for
help
in
their
distress
He
saved
them
from
their
plight
14
He
brought
them
out
of
deepest
darkness
And
he
tore
off
their
shackles
15
Let
people
give
thanks
to
Jehovah
for
his
loyal
loveAnd
for
his
wonderful
works
in
behalf
of
the
sons
of
men
16
For
he
has
broken
down
the
doors
of
copperAnd
cut
through
the
bars
of
iron
17
They
were
foolish
and
suffered
afflictionOn
account
of
their
transgressions
and
their
errors
18
They
lost
their
appetite
for
all
food
They
drew
near
the
gates
of
death
19
They
would
call
to
Jehovah
for
help
in
their
distress
He
would
save
them
from
their
plight
20
He
would
send
his
word
and
heal
themAnd
rescue
them
from
the
pits
they
were
trapped
in
21
Let
people
give
thanks
to
Jehovah
for
his
loyal
loveAnd
for
his
wonderful
works
in
behalf
of
the
sons
of
men
22
Let
them
offer
the
sacrifices
of
thanksgivingAnd
declare
his
works
with
a
joyful
cry
23
Those
who
travel
on
the
sea
in
ships
Who
ply
their
trade
over
the
vast
waters
24
They
have
seen
the
works
of
JehovahAnd
his
wonderful
works
in
the
deep
25
How
by
his
word
a
windstorm
arises
Lifting
up
the
waves
of
the
sea
26
They
rise
up
to
the
sky
They
plunge
down
to
the
depths
Their
courage
melts
away
because
of
the
impending
calamity
27
They
reel
and
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
And
all
their
skill
proves
useless
28
Then
they
cry
out
to
Jehovah
in
their
distress
And
he
rescues
them
from
their
plight
29
He
calms
the
windstorm
The
waves
of
the
sea
grow
quiet
30
They
rejoice
when
these
grow
still
And
he
leads
them
to
their
desired
harbor
31
Let
people
give
thanks
to
Jehovah
for
his
loyal
loveAnd
for
his
wonderful
works
in
behalf
of
the
sons
of
men
32
Let
them
exalt
him
in
the
congregation
of
the
people
And
let
them
praise
him
in
the
council
of
the
elders
33
He
turns
rivers
into
a
desertAnd
springs
of
water
into
parched
ground
34
Fruitful
land
into
salty
wasteland
Because
of
the
wickedness
of
those
dwelling
in
it
35
He
turns
the
desert
into
reedy
pools
of
water
And
dry
land
into
springs
of
water
36
He
causes
the
hungry
to
dwell
there
So
that
they
may
establish
a
city
where
they
can
live
37
They
sow
fields
and
plant
vineyardsThat
yield
fruitful
crops
38
He
blesses
them
and
they
increase
greatly
He
does
not
let
their
cattle
diminish
39
But
again
they
become
few
and
are
humiliatedBecause
of
oppression
calamity
and
grief
40
He
pours
out
contempt
upon
noblesAnd
makes
them
wander
in
trackless
wastelands
41
But
he
protects
the
poor
from
oppressionAnd
makes
their
families
as
numerous
as
a
flock
42
The
upright
see
this
and
rejoice
But
all
the
unrighteous
shut
their
mouths
43
Whoever
is
wise
will
observe
these
thingsAnd
will
carefully
consider
Jehovahs
acts
of
loyal
love
A
song
A
melody
of
David
108
My
heart
is
steadfast
O
God
I
will
sing
and
make
music
with
my
whole
being

2
Do
awake
O
stringed
instrument
you
too
O
harp
I
will
awaken
the
dawn

3
I
will
praise
you
among
the
peoples
O
Jehovah
And
I
will
sing
praises
to
you
among
the
nations

4
For
your
loyal
love
is
great
as
high
as
the
heavens
And
your
faithfulness
up
to
the
skies

5
Be
exalted
above
the
heavens
O
God
May
your
glory
be
over
all
the
earth

6
So
that
your
loved
ones
may
be
rescued
Save
us
with
your
right
hand
and
answer
me

7
God
has
spoken
in
his
holiness
I
will
exult
I
will
give
out
Shechem
as
an
inheritance
And
I
will
measure
off
the
Valley
of
Succoth

8
Gilead
belongs
to
me
as
does
Manasseh
And
Ephraim
is
the
helmet
for
my
head
Judah
is
my
commanders
staff

9
Moab
is
my
washbasin
Over
Edom
I
will
throw
my
sandal
Over
Philistia
I
will
shout
in
triumph
10
Who
will
bring
me
to
the
fortified
city
Who
will
lead
me
as
far
as
Edom
11
Is
it
not
you
O
God
who
have
rejected
us
Our
God
who
no
longer
goes
out
with
our
armies
12
Help
us
in
our
distress
For
salvation
by
humans
is
worthless
13
By
God
we
will
gain
power
And
he
will
trample
on
our
adversaries
To
the
director
Of
David
A
melody
109
O
God
whom
I
praise
do
not
remain
silent

2
For
the
wicked
and
the
deceitful
open
their
mouths
against
me
They
speak
about
me
with
lying
tongues
3
They
surround
me
with
hateful
words
And
they
attack
me
without
cause

4
They
resist
me
in
response
to
my
love
But
I
continue
to
pray

5
They
repay
me
with
bad
for
goodAnd
hatred
for
my
love

6
Appoint
a
wicked
man
over
him
May
a
resister
stand
at
his
right
hand

7
When
he
is
judged
may
he
be
found
guilty
May
even
his
prayer
be
counted
as
a
sin

8
Let
his
days
be
few
His
office
of
oversight
let
someone
else
take

9
Let
his
children
become
fatherless
And
his
wife
a
widow
10
May
his
children
become
wandering
beggars
Foraging
for
food
from
their
ruined
homes
11
May
his
creditor
seize
all
that
he
has
And
may
strangers
plunder
his
possessions
12
May
no
one
extend
kindness
to
him
And
may
no
one
show
favor
to
his
fatherless
children
13
Let
his
descendants
be
cut
off
May
their
name
be
erased
within
a
generation
14
Let
the
error
of
his
forefathers
be
remembered
by
Jehovah
And
may
the
sin
of
his
mother
not
be
erased
15
May
Jehovah
always
be
mindful
of
what
they
have
done
And
may
he
cut
off
the
memory
of
them
from
the
earth
16
For
he
did
not
remember
to
show
kindness
But
he
kept
pursuing
the
oppressed
poor
and
brokenhearted
manTo
put
him
to
death
17
He
loved
to
pronounce
a
curse
so
that
is
what
came
upon
him
He
had
no
desire
to
bless
so
he
received
no
blessing
18
He
was
clothed
with
curses
as
his
garment
And
they
were
poured
into
his
body
like
water
Into
his
bones
like
oil
19
May
his
curses
be
like
the
clothing
in
which
he
wraps
himselfAnd
like
a
belt
he
always
wears
20
This
is
the
payment
from
Jehovah
for
the
one
who
resists
meAnd
for
those
who
speak
evil
things
against
me
21
But
you
Jehovah
the
Sovereign
Lord
Act
in
my
behalf
for
the
sake
of
your
name
Rescue
me
because
your
loyal
love
is
good
22
For
I
am
helpless
and
poor
And
my
heart
has
been
pierced
within
me
23
I
am
passing
away
like
a
fading
shadow
I
have
been
shaken
off
like
a
locust
24
My
knees
give
way
from
fasting
My
body
is
thin
and
I
am
wasting
away
25
I
have
become
the
object
of
their
taunts
When
they
see
me
they
shake
their
heads
26
Help
me
O
Jehovah
my
God
Save
me
by
your
loyal
love
27
May
they
know
that
this
is
by
your
hand
That
you
O
Jehovah
have
done
it
28
Let
them
pronounce
a
curse
but
may
you
give
a
blessing
When
they
rise
up
against
me
may
they
be
put
to
shame
But
let
your
servant
rejoice
29
Let
those
who
resist
me
be
clothed
with
humiliation
May
they
be
wrapped
in
their
shame
as
in
a
robe
30
My
mouth
will
fervently
praise
Jehovah
I
will
praise
him
in
front
of
many
people
31
For
he
will
stand
at
the
right
hand
of
the
poorTo
save
him
from
those
who
condemn
him
Of
David
A

Jehovah
declared
to
my
Lord
Sit
at
my
right
handUntil
I
place
your
enemies
as
a
stool
for
your
feet

2
Jehovah
will
extend
the
scepter
of
your
power
out
of
Zion
saying
Go
subduing
in
the
midst
of
your
enemies

3
Your
people
will
offer
themselves
willingly
on
the
day
of
your
military
force
In
splendid
holiness
from
the
womb
of
the
dawn
You
have
your
company
of
young
men
just
like
dewdrops

4
Jehovah
has
sworn
an
oath
and
he
will
not
change
his
mind
You
are
a
priest
foreverIn
the
manner
of
Melchizedek

5
Jehovah
will
be
at
your
right
hand
He
will
crush
kings
on
the
day
of
his
anger

6
He
will
execute
judgment
against
the
nations
He
will
fill
the
land
with
dead
bodies
He
will
crush
the
leader
of
a
vast
land

7
He
will
drink
from
the
stream
along
the
road
Therefore
he
will
hold
his
head
high

O

not

But
to
your
name
give

of
your
loyal
love
and
your
faithfulness

Why
should
the
nations
say
Where
is
their
God

3
Our
God
is
in
the
heavens
He
does
whatever
he
pleases

4
Their
idols
are
silver

gold
The
work

I
love
JehovahBecause

hears

voice
my
pleas
for

For
he
inclines
his
ear
to
me
And
I
will
call
on
him
as
long
as
I
live

3
The
ropes
of
death
encircled
me
The
Grave
had
me
in
its
grip
I
was
overcome
by
distress
and
grief

4
But
I
called
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
O
Jehovah
rescue
me

5
Jehovah
is
compassionate
and
righteous
Our
God
is
merciful

6
Jehovah
is
guarding
the
inexperienced
I
was
brought
low
and
he
saved
me

7
Let
my
soul
rest
once
again
For
Jehovah
has
dealt
kindly
with
me

8
You
have
rescued
me
from
death
My
eye
from
tears
my
foot
from
stumbling

9
I
will
walk
before
Jehovah
in
the
land
of
the
living
10
I
had
faith

I
spoke
I
was
greatly
afflicted
11
As
for
me
I
panicked
and
said
Every
man
is
a
liar
12
With
what
will
I
repay
JehovahFor
all
the
good
he
has
done
for
me
13
I
will
take
up
the
cup
of
salvation
And
I
will
call
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
14
I
will
pay
my
vows
to
JehovahIn
the
presence
of
all
his
people
15
Costly
in
the
eyes
of
JehovahIs
the
death
of
his
loyal
ones
16
I
beg
you
O
Jehovah
For
I
am
your
servant
I
am
your
servant
the
son
of
your
slave
girl
You
have
freed
me
from
my
bonds
17
I
will
offer
to
you
the
sacrifice
of
thanksgiving
I
will
call
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
18
I
will
pay
my
vows
to
JehovahIn
the
presence
of
all
his
people
19
In
the
courtyards
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
In
your
midst
O
Jerusalem
Praise
Jah

Jehovah

you

Let
those
of
the
house
of
Aaron
now
say
His
loyal
love
endures
forever

4
Let
those
fearing
Jehovah
now
say
His
loyal
love
endures
forever

5
I
called
on
Jah
in
my
distress
Jah
answered
and
brought
me
into
a
place
of
safety

6
Jehovah
is
on
my
side
I
will
not
be
afraid
What
can
man
do
to
me

7
Jehovah
is
on
my
side
as
my
helper
I
will
look
in
triumph
on
those
who
hate
me

8
It
is
better
to
take
refuge
in
JehovahThan
to
trust
in
humans

9
It
is
better
to
take
refuge
in
JehovahThan
to
trust
in
princes
10
All
the
nations
surrounded
me
But
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
I
warded
them
off
11
They
surrounded
me
yes
I
was
completely
surrounded
But
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
I
warded
them
off
12
They
surrounded
me
like
bees
But
they
were
extinguished
as
quickly
as
a
fire
among
thorns
In
the
name
of
Jehovah
I
warded
them
off
13
I
was
pushed
hard
to
make
me
fall
But
Jehovah
helped
me
14
Jah
is
my
shelter
and
my
strength
And
he
has
become
my
salvation
15
The
sound
of
rejoicing
and
salvationIs
in
the
tents
of
the
righteous
The
right
hand
of
Jehovah
is
demonstrating
its
power
16
The
right
hand
of
Jehovah
is
exalting
itself
The
right
hand
of
Jehovah
is
demonstrating
its
power
17
I
will
not
die
no
I
will
live
In
order
to
declare
the
works
of
Jah
18
Jah
disciplined
me
severely
But
he
did
not
hand
me
over
to
death
19
Open
to
me
the
gates
of
righteousness
I
will
enter
them
and
praise
Jah
20
This
is
the
gate
of
Jehovah
The
righteous
will
enter
through
it
21
I
will
praise
you
for
you
answered
meAnd
you
became
my
salvation
22
The
stone
that
the
builders
rejectedHas
become
the
chief
cornerstone
23
This
has
come
from
Jehovah
It
is

in
our
eyes

This
is
the
day

has
made

be
joyful
and

in
it

has
preserved
me
alive
51
The
presumptuous

But
I
do
not
deviate
from
your
law
52
I
remember
your
judgments
from
of
old
O
Jehovah
And
I
find
comfort
in
them
53
I
am
seized
with
burning
rage
because
of
the
wicked
Who
forsake
your
law
54
Your
regulations
are
songs
to
meWherever
I
dwell
55
During
the
night
I
remember
your
name
O
Jehovah
So
that
I
may
keep
your
law
56
This
has
been
my
practiceBecause
I
have
observed
your
orders
57
Jehovah
is
my
portion
I
have
promised
to
keep
your
words
58
I
appeal
to
you
with
all
my
heart
Show
me

according
to
your
promise
59

have
examined
my
ways

order
to
turn
my
feet
back
to
your
reminders
60
I
hurry
and
do
not
delayTo
keep
your
commandments
61
The
ropes
of
the
wicked
surround
me
But
your
law
I
do
not
forget
62
At
midnight
I
get
up
to
give
you
thanksFor
your
righteous
judgments
63
I
am
a
friend
of
all
who
fear
youAnd

those
who

your
orders
64
Your
loyal
love
O
Jehovah

the
earth

me
your
regulations

You
have
dealt
well
with
your
servant
O
Jehovah
according
to
your
word
66
Teach
me
good
sense
and
knowledge
For
I
have
put
my
trust
in
your
commandments
67
Before
I
was
afflicted
I
used
to
go
astray
But
now
I
keep
your
saying
68
You
are
good
and
your
works
are
good
Teach
me
your
regulations
69
The
presumptuous
smear
me
with
lies
But
I
observe
your
orders
with
all
my
heart
70
Their
heart
is
insensitive
But
I
am
fond
of
your
law
71
It
is
good
that
I
have
been
afflicted
So
that
I
may
learn
your
regulations
72
The
law
that
you
have
proclaimed
is
good
for
me
More
so
than
thousands
of
pieces
of
gold
and
silver
73
Your
hands
made
me
and
formed
me
Give
me
understanding
So
that
I
may
learn
your
commandments
74
Those
who
fear
you
see
me
and
rejoice
For
your
word
is
my
hope
75
I
know
O
Jehovah
that
your
judgments
are
righteousAnd
that
you
have
afflicted
me
in
your
faithfulness
76
May
your
loyal
love
please
comfort
me
According
to
the
promise
you
made
to
your
servant
77
Show
me
mercy
so
that
I
may
keep
living
For
I
am
fond
of
your
law
78
May
the
presumptuous
be
put
to
shame
For
they
wrong
me
without
cause
But
I
will
ponder
over
your
orders
79
Let
those
who
fear
you
return
to
me
Those
who
know
your
reminders
80
May
my
heart
be
blameless
in
following
your
regulations
So
that
I
may
not
be
put
to
shame
81
I
long
for
your
salvation
For
your
word
is
my
hope
82
My
eyes
long
for
your
sayingWhile
I
say
When
will
you
comfort
me
83
For
I
am
like
a
skin
bottle
dried
up
in
the
smoke
But
your
regulations
I
do
not
forget
84
How
many
days
must
your
servant
wait
When
will
you
bring
judgment
against
those
persecuting
me
85
The
presumptuous
dig
pits
for
me
Those
who
defy
your
law
86
All
your
commandments
are
trustworthy
Men
persecute
me
without
cause
help
me
87
They
almost
exterminated
me
from
the
earth
But
I
did
not
abandon
your
orders
88
Preserve
me
alive
because
of
your
loyal
love
So
that
I
may
keep
the
reminders
you
have
spoken
89
Forever
O
Jehovah
Your
word
will
remain
in
the
heavens
90
Your
faithfulness
is
through
all
generations
You
have
firmly
established
the
earth
so
that
it
continues
to
stand
91
By
your
judgments
they
remain
until
today
For
they
are
all
your
servants
92
If
I
had
not
been
fond
of
your
law
I
would
have
perished
in
my
affliction
93
I
will
never
forget
your
orders
Because
by
them
you
have
preserved
me
alive
94
I
belong
to
you
save
me
Because
I
have
searched
for
your
orders
95
The
wicked
wait
to
destroy
me
But
I
give
close
attention
to
your
reminders
96
I
have
seen
a
limit
to
all
perfection
But
your
commandment
has
no
limit
97
How
I
do
love
your
law
I
ponder
over
it
all
day
long
98
Your
commandment
makes
me
wiser
than
my
enemies
Because
it
is
with
me
forever
99
I
have
more
insight
than
all
my
teachers
Because
I
ponder
over
your
reminders
100
I
act
with
more
understanding
than
older
men
Because
I
observe
your
orders
101
I
refuse
to
walk
on
any
evil
path
So
that
I
may
keep
your
word
102
I
do
not
turn
aside
from
your
judgments
For
you
have
instructed
me
103
How
sweet
your
sayings
are
to
my
palate
More
so
than
honey
to
my
mouth
104
By
your
orders
I
act
with
understanding
That
is
why
I
hate
every
false
path
105
Your
word
is
a
lamp
to
my
foot
And
a
light
for
my
path
106
I
have
sworn
an
oath
and
I
will
carry
it
out
To
observe
your
righteous
judgments
107
I
have
been
greatly
afflicted
O
Jehovah
preserve
me
alive
according
to
your
word
108
Please
take
pleasure
in
my
voluntary
offerings
of
praise
O
Jehovah
And
teach
me
your
judgments
109
My
life
is
in
constant
danger
But
I
have
not
forgotten
your
law
110
The
wicked
have
set
a
trap
for
me
But
I
have
not
strayed
from
your
orders
111
I
take
your
reminders
as
my
permanent
possession
For
they
are
the
joy
of
my
heart
112
I
have
resolved
to
obey
your
regulationsAt
all
times
down
to
the
last
113
I
hate
the
halfhearted
ones
But
I
love
your
law
114
You
are
my
shelter
and
my
shield
For
your
word
is
my
hope
115
Stay
away
from
me
you
evil
men
So
that
I
may
observe
the
commandments
of
my
God
116
Support
me
as
you
promised
So
that
I
may
keep
living
Do
not
let
my
hope
turn
into
disappointment
117
Support
me
that
I
may
be
saved
Then
I
will
always
concentrate
on
your
regulations
118
You
reject
all
those
who
stray
from
your
regulations
For
they
are
false
and
deceitful
119
You
discard
all
the
wicked
of
the
earth
as
if
they
were
worthless
dross
That
is
why
I
love
your
reminders
120
The
dread
of
you
makes
my
body
tremble
I
am
in
fear
of
your
judgments
121
I
have
done
what
is
just
and
righteous
Do
not
abandon
me
to
my
oppressors
122
Guarantee
the
welfare
of
your
servant
May
the
presumptuous
not
oppress
me
123
My
eyes
have
grown
weary
waiting
for
your
salvationAnd
for
your
righteous
promise
124
Show
your
loyal
love
to
your
servant
And
teach
me
your
regulations
125
I
am
your
servant
give
me
understanding
So
that
I
may
know
your
reminders
126
The
time
has
come
for
Jehovah
to
act
For
they
have
broken
your
law
127
That
is
why
I
love
your
commandmentsMore
than
gold
even
fine
gold
128
Therefore
I
consider
every
instruction
from
you
to
be
right
I
hate
every
false
path
129
Your
reminders
are
wonderful
That
is
why
I
observe
them
130
The
disclosure
of
your
words
brings
light
Giving
understanding
to
the
inexperienced
131
I
open
my
mouth
wide
and
sigh
Because
I
long
for
your
commandments
132
Turn
to
me
and
show
me
favor
In
keeping
with
your
judgment
toward
those
loving
your
name
133
Guide
my
steps
safely
by
your
saying
May
nothing
wicked
dominate
me
134
Rescue
me
from
oppressive
men
And
I
will
keep
your
orders
135
Make
your
face
shine
upon
your
servant
And
teach
me
your
regulations
136
Tears
stream
down
from
my
eyesBecause
people
do
not
keep
your
law
137
You
are
righteous
O
Jehovah
And
your
judgments
are
fair
138
The
reminders
you
give
are
righteousAnd
completely
reliable
139
My
zeal
consumes
me
Because
my
adversaries
have
forgotten
your
words
140
Your
saying
is
thoroughly
refined
And
your
servant
loves
it
141
I
am
insignificant
and
despised
Yet
I
have
not
forgotten
your
orders
142
Your
righteousness
is
an
eternal
righteousness
And
your
law
is
truth
143
Though
distress
and
difficulty
come
upon
me
I
remain
fond
of
your
commandments
144
The
righteousness
of
your
reminders
is
eternal
Give
me
understanding
so
that
I
may
keep
living
145
I
call
with
my
whole
heart
Answer
me
O
Jehovah
Your
regulations
I
will
observe
146
I
call
on
you

me
I
will
keep
your
reminders
147
I
have
been
awake
before
dawn
to
cry
for
help
For
your
words
are
my
hope
148
My
eyes
open
before
the
night
watches
So
that
I
can
ponder
over
your
saying
149
Do
listen
to
my
voice
because
of
your
loyal
love
O
Jehovah
preserve
me
alive
according
to
your
justice
150
Those
who
engage
in
shameful
conduct
come
near
They
are
far
away
from
your
law
151
You
are
near
O
Jehovah
And
all
your
commandments
are
truth
152
Long
ago
I
learned
about
your
reminders
That
you
have
established
them
to
last
forever
153
Look
on
my
affliction
and
rescue
me
For
I
have
not
forgotten
your
law
154
Defend
me
and
rescue
me
Preserve
me
alive
in
harmony
with
your
promise
155
Salvation
is
far
away
from
the
wicked
For
they
have
not
searched
for
your
regulations
156
Your
mercy
is
great
O
Jehovah
Preserve
me
alive
in
harmony
with
your
justice
157
My
persecutors
and
my
adversaries
are
many
But
I
have
not
deviated
from
your
reminders
158
I
look
on
the
treacherous
with
loathing
Because
they
do
not
keep
your
saying
159
See
how
I
love
your
orders
O
Jehovah
preserve
me
alive
because
of
your
loyal
love
160
The
very
essence
of
your
word
is
truth
And
all
your
righteous
judgments
endure
forever
161
Princes
persecute
me
for
no
cause
But
my
heart
stands
in
awe
of
your
words
162
I
rejoice
over
your
sayingLike
someone
who
finds
great
spoil
163
I
hate
falsehood—I
detest
it—I
love
your
law
164
Seven
times
a
day
I
praise
youBecause
of
your
righteous
judgments
165
Abundant
peace
belongs
to
those
who
love
your
law
Nothing
can
make
them
stumble
166
I
hope
for
your
acts
of
salvation
O
Jehovah
And
I
observe
your
commandments
167
I
keep
your
reminders
And
I
love
them
dearly
168
I
observe
your
orders
and
your
reminders
For
you
are
aware
of
all
that
I
do
169
May
my
cry
for
help
reach
you
O
Jehovah
According
to
your
word
make
me
understand
170
May
my
request
for
favor
come
before
you
Save
me
as
you
have
promised
171
May
my
lips
overflow
with
praise
For
you
teach
me
your
regulations
172
May
my
tongue
sing
about
your
saying
For
all
your
commandments
are
righteous
173
May
your
hand
be
ready
to
help
me
Because
I
choose
to
obey
your
orders
174
I
long
for
your
salvation
O
Jehovah
And
I
am
fond
of
your
law
175
Let
me
live
so
that
I
may
praise
you
May
your
judgments
be
my
help
176
I
have
strayed
like
a
lost
sheep
Search
for
your
servant
For
I
have
not
forgotten
your
commandments

to
Jehovah
in

And
he
answered
me

O
Jehovah
rescue
me
from
lying
lipsAnd
from
the
deceitful
tongue

3
What
will
He
do
to
you
and
how
will
He
punish
you
You
deceitful
tongue

4
With
sharp
arrows
of

burning
coals

5
Woe
to
me
for
I
have
lived
as
a
foreigner
in
Meshech
I
have
been
dwelling
among
the
tents
of
Kedar

6
I
have
been
dwelling
far

longWith
those
who
hate
peace

7
I
am
for
peace
but
when
I
speak
They
are
for
war
A

From

my

My

comes
from
Jehovah
The

A
Song

Of

122
I
rejoiced
when
they
said
to
me
Let
us
go
to
the
house
of
Jehovah

2
And
now
our
feet
are
standingWithin
your
gates
O
Jerusalem

3
Jerusalem
is
built
as
a

is
joined
together
as
one

4
The

have
gone
up
to
it
The

of
Jah
According
to
the

to
Israel
To
give
thanks
to
the
name
of
Jehovah

For
thrones

were
set
up
there

Ask
for

Those
who
love

O

will
be

May
peace
continue
within
your

Security
within
your

towers

8
For
the
sake
of
my
brothers
and
my

I
will
say
May
there
be
peace
within

To
you

raise

You
who
are

As
the

servants
look
to
the
hand
of
their
master
And
the
eyes
of
a
servant
girl
to
the
hand
of
her
mistress
So
our
eyes
look
to
Jehovah
our
GodUntil
he
shows
us
favor

3
Show
us
favor
O
Jehovah
show
us
favor
For
we
have
had
our
full
share
of
contempt

4
We
have
had
our
full
share
of
ridicule
from
the
self-assuredAnd
the
contempt
of
the
arrogant
A

124
If
Jehovah
had
not
been
with
us
—Let
Israel
now
say—
2
If
Jehovah
had
not
been
with
usWhen
men
rose
up
to
attack
us
3
Then
they
would
have
swallowed
us
up
aliveWhen
their
anger
was
burning
against
us

4
Then
the
waters
would
have
washed
us
away
The
torrent
would
have
swept
over
us

5
The
raging
waters
would
have
overwhelmed
us

6
May
Jehovah
be
praised
For
he
has
not
given
us
as
prey
to
their
teeth

7
We
are
like
a
bird

The

The

So
that

A
Song

When
Jehovah
gathered
back
the
captives
of
Zion
We
thought
we
were
dreaming

2
At
that
time
our
mouth
was
filled
with
laughterAnd
our
tongue
with
a
joyful
shout
At
that
time
they
said
among
the
nations
Jehovah
has
done
great
things
for
them

3
Jehovah
has
done
great
things
for
us
And
we
are
overjoyed

4
Do
gather
back
our
captives
O
Jehovah
Like
streams
in
the
Negeb

5
Those
sowing
seed
with
tearsWill
reap
with
a
joyful
shout

6
The
one
who
does
go
out
though
weeping
Carrying
his
bag
of
seed
Will
surely
return
with
a
joyful
shout
Carrying
in
his
sheaves
A

Ascents
Of

127
Unless
Jehovah
builds
the
house
It
is
in
vain
that
its
builders
work
hard
on
it
Unless
Jehovah
guards
the
city
It
is
in
vain
that
the
guard
stays
awake

2
It
is
in
vain
that
you
rise
up
early
That
you
stay
up
late
That
you
toil
for
your
food
Since
he
provides
for
his
loved
ones
while
giving
them
sleep

3
Look
Sons
are
an
inheritance
from
Jehovah
The
fruit
of
the
womb
is
a
reward

4
Like
arrows
in
the
hand
of
a
mighty
man
So
are
the

5
Happy
is
the

who
fills

they

Happy
is
everyone
who
fears

You
will
eat
what
your

worked
hard
to
produce
You
will
be
happy
and
will
enjoy
prosperity

3
Your

will
be
like
a
fruitful
vine
within
your

Your

will
be
like
shoots

an
olive
tree
around
your
table

4
Look
That
is
how
the

who
fears
JehovahWill
be
blessed

5
Jehovah
will
bless
you
from
Zion
May
you
see
Jerusalem
prosper

But
they

Plowmen
have

back
They

made
their

But
Jehovah
is
righteous
He
has
cut
up
the
ropes
of
the
wicked

5
They
will
be
put
to
shame
and
will
retreat
in
disgrace
All

hate
Zion

grass
on

withers
before

That
cannot
fill

May
your

were

watch
O

Then
who
O

could
stand

4
For
with
you
there
is
true
forgiveness
So
that
you

be
held
in

Yes
more

wait

Let

keep
waiting

For
Jehovah
is
loyal

And
he
has
great
power
to
redeem

He
will
redeem
Israel
from
all
their

O
Jehovah
my

is
not
haughty
Nor
are
my
eyes
lofty
Nor
do
I
aspire
to
things
too
great
Or
to
things
that
are
beyond
me

No
but
I
have
calmed
and
quieted
my
soulLike

DavidAnd
all
his
suffering

How
he
swore
to
Jehovah
How
he
vowed
to
the
Powerful
One
of
Jacob

3
I
will
not
go
into
my
tent
my
home
I
will
not
lie
upon
my
couch
my
bed
4
I
will
not
allow
my
eyes
to
sleep
Nor
my
eyelids
to
slumber
5
Until
I
find
a
place
for
Jehovah
A
fine
residence
for
the
Powerful
One
of
Jacob

6
Look
We
heard
about
it
in
Ephrathah
We
found
it
in
the
fields

7
Let
us
come
into
his
residence
Let
us
bow
down
at
his
footstool

8
Rise
up
O
Jehovah
to
come
to
your
resting-place
You
and
the
Ark
of
your

be

And
may

Do
not

11
Jehovah
has
sworn
to
David
He
will
surely
not
go
back
on
his
word
One
of
your
offspring
I
will
place
on
your
throne
12
If
your
sons
keep
my
covenantAnd
my
reminders
that
I
teach
them
Their

tooWill
sit
on

throne
forever

For
Jehovah
has
chosen
Zion
He
has
desired
it
for
his
dwelling
place
14
This
is
my
resting-place
forever
Here
I
will
dwell
for
this
is
my
desire
15
I
will
richly
bless
it
with
provisions
I
will
satisfy
its
poor
with
bread

Its

I
will
clothe
with
salvation
And
its
loyal
ones
will
shout
joyfully

There
I
will
make
the
strength
of
David
grow
I
have
prepared
a
lamp
for
my

will
clothe
his

on
his

will
flourish

fine
oil
poured
on
the
headThat
runs
down
the

Aarons
beard
And
runs
down
onto
the

his

13
O
Jehovah
your
name
endures
forever
O
Jehovah
your
fame
endures
for
all
generations
14
For
Jehovah
will
defend
his
people
And
he
will
feel
compassion
for
his
servants
15
The
idols
of
the
nations
are
silver
and
gold
The
work
of
human
hands
16
A
mouth
they
have
but
they
cannot
speak
Eyes
but
they
cannot
see
17
Ears
they
have
but
they
cannot
hear
There
is
no
breath
in
their
mouth
18
The
people
who
make
them
will
become
just
like
them
As
will
all
those
who
trust
in
them

By
the
rivers
of
Babylon
there
we
sat
We
wept
when
we
remembered
Zion

2
Upon
the
poplar
trees
in
her
midst
We
hung
our
harps

3
For
there
our
captors
asked
us
for
a
song
Those
mocking
us
wanted
amusement
Sing
for
us
one
of
the
songs
of
Zion

4
How
can
we
sing
the
song
of
JehovahOn
foreign
soil

5
If
I
should
forget
you
O
Jerusalem
Let
my
right
hand
be
forgetful

6
Let
my
tongue
stick
to
my
palateIf
I
do
not
remember
you
If
I
do
not
place
Jerusalem
aboveMy
greatest
reasons
for
rejoicing

7
Remember
O
Jehovah
What
the
Edomites
said
on
the
day
Jerusalem
fell
Tear
it
down
Tear
it
down
to
its
foundations

8
O
daughter
of
Babylon
who
is
soon
to
be
devastated
Happy
will
be
the
one
who
rewards
youWith
the
treatment
you
inflicted
on
us

9
Happy
will
be
the
one
who
seizes
your
childrenAnd
dashes
them
against
the
rocks
Of
David
138
I
will
praise
you
with
all
my
heart
In
the
face
of
other
gods
I
will
sing
praises

2
I
will
bow
down
toward
your
holy
temple
And
I
will
praise
your
nameBecause
of
your
loyal
love
and
your
faithfulness
For
you
have
magnified
your
saying
and
your
name
above
everything
else

3
On
the
day
I
called
you
answered
me
You
made
me
bold
and
strong

4
All
the
kings
of
the
earth
will
praise
you
O
Jehovah
For
they
will
have
heard
the
promises
you
have
spoken

5
They
will
sing
about
the
ways
of
Jehovah
For
the
glory
of
Jehovah
is
great

6
Though
Jehovah
is
high
he
takes
note
of
the
humble
But
the
haughty
he
knows
only
from
a
distance

7
Even
when
I
walk
in
the
midst
of
danger
you
will
preserve
me
alive
You
stretch
out
your
hand
against
the
anger
of
my
enemies
Your
right
hand
will
save
me

8
Jehovah
will
accomplish
all
things
in
my
behalf
O
Jehovah
your
loyal
love
endures
forever
Do
not
forsake
the
works
of
your
hands
For
the
director
Of
David
A
melody
139
O
Jehovah
you
have
searched
through
me
and
you
know
me

2
You
know
when
I
sit
down
and
when
I
rise
up
You
discern
my
thoughts
from
afar

3
You
observe
me
when
I
travel
and
when
I
lie
down
You
are
familiar
with
all
my
ways

4
There
is
not
a
word
on
my
tongue
But
look
O
Jehovah
you
already
know
it
well

5
Behind
and
before
me
you
surround
me
And
you
lay
your
hand
upon
me

6
Such
knowledge
is
beyond
my
comprehension
It
is
too
high
for
me
to
reach

7
Where
can
I
escape
from
your
spirit
And
where
can
I
run
away
from
your
face

8
If
I
were
to
ascend
to
heaven
you
would
be
there
And
if
I
were
to
make
my
bed
in
the
Grave
look
you
would
be
there

9
If
I
would
fly
away
with
the
wings
of
the
dawnTo
reside
by
the
most
remote
sea
10
Even
there
your
hand
would
lead
meAnd
your
right
hand
would
take
hold
of
me
11
If
I
say
Surely
darkness
will
conceal
me
Then
the
night
around
me
would
become
light
12
Even
the
darkness
would
not
be
too
dark
for
you
But
night
would
be
as
bright
as
the
day
Darkness
is
the
same
as
light
to
you
13
For
you
produced
my
kidneys
You
kept
me
screened
off
in
my
mothers
womb
14
I
praise
you
because
in
an
awe-inspiring
way
I
am
wonderfully
made
Your
works
are
wonderful
I
know
this
very
well
15
My
bones
were
not
hidden
from
youWhen
I
was
made
in
secret
When
I
was
woven
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
16
Your
eyes
even
saw
me
as
an
embryo
All
its
parts
were
written
in
your
bookRegarding
the
days
when
they
were
formed
Before
any
of
them
existed
17
So
to
me
how
precious
your
thoughts
are
O
God
how
vast
is
the
sum
of
them
18
If
I
try
to
count
them
they
outnumber
the
grains
of
sand
When
I
awake
I
am
still
with
you
19
O
God
if
only
you
would
slay
the
wicked
Then
the
violent
men
would
depart
from
me
20
Those
who
say
things
against
you
with
evil
intent
They
are
your
adversaries
who
take
up
your
name
in
a
worthless
way
21
Do
I
not
hate
those
who
hate
you
O
Jehovah
And
loathe
those
who
revolt
against
you
22
I
have
nothing
but
hatred
for
them
They
have
become
real
enemies
to
me
23
Search
through
me
O
God
and
know
my
heart
Examine
me
and
know
my
anxious
thoughts
24
See
whether
there
is
in
me
any
harmful
way
And
lead
me
in
the
way
of
eternity
For
the
director
A
melody
of
David
140
Rescue
me
O
Jehovah
from
evil
men
Protect
me
from
violent
men
2
Those
who
scheme
evil
in
their
heartsAnd
stir
up
conflict
all
day
long

3
They
sharpen
their
tongue
like
that
of
a
serpent
Venom
of
vipers
is
behind
their
lips
Selah

4
Protect
me
O
Jehovah
from
the
hands
of
the
wicked
Safeguard
me
from
violent
men
Those
who
scheme
to
trip
me

5
The
haughty
ones
hide
a
trap
for
me
With
ropes
they
spread
out
a
net
beside
the
path
They
set
snares
for
me
Selah

6
I
say
to
Jehovah
You
are
my
God
Listen
O
Jehovah
to
my
pleas
for
help

7
O
Jehovah
the
Sovereign
Lord
my
strong
Savior
You
shield
my
head
in
the
day
of
battle

8
Do
not
grant
O
Jehovah
the
desires
of
the
wicked
Do
not
let
their
plots
succeed
so
that
they
are
not
exalted
Selah

9
May
the
heads
of
those
surrounding
meBe
covered
with
the
evil
spoken
by
their
lips
10
May
burning
coals
rain
down
on
them
May
they
be
hurled
into
the
fire
Into
deep
pits
never
to
rise
again
11
May
the
slanderer
find
no
place
on
the
earth
May
evil
pursue
men
of
violence
and
strike
them
down
12
I
know
that
Jehovah
will
defend
the
lowlyAnd
give
justice
to
the
poor
13
Surely
the
righteous
will
give
thanks
to
your
name
The
upright
will
dwell
before
your
face
A
melody
of
David
141
O
Jehovah
I
call
on
you
Come
quickly
to
help
me
Do
pay
attention
when
I
call
to
you

2
May
my
prayer
be
as
incense
prepared
before
you
My
uplifted
hands
like
the
evening
grain
offering

3
Station
a
guard
for
my
mouth
O
Jehovah
Do
set
a
watch
over
the
door
of
my
lips

4
Do
not
let
my
heart
incline
to
anything
bad
To
share
in
vile
deeds
with
evil
men
May
I
never
feast
on
their
delicacies

5
Should
the
righteous
one
strike
me
it
would
be
an
act
of
loyal
love
Should
he
reprove
me
it
would
be
like
oil
on
my
head
Which
my
head
would
never
refuse
My
prayer
will
continue
even
during
their
calamities

6
Though
their
judges
are
thrown
down
from
the
cliff
The
people
will
pay
attention
to
my
words
for
they
are
pleasant

7
Just
as
when
someone
plows
and
breaks
up
the
soil
So
our
bones
have
been
scattered
at
the
mouth
of
the
Grave

8
But
my
eyes
look
to
you
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
In
you
I
have
taken
refuge
Do
not
take
away
my
life

9
Protect
me
from
the
jaws
of
the
trap
they
have
laid
for
me
From
the
snares
of
evildoers
10
The
wicked
will
fall
into
their
own
nets
all
togetherWhile
I
pass
by
safely
Maskil
Of
David
when
he
was
in
the
cave
A
prayer
142
With
my
voice
I
call
to
Jehovah
for
help
With
my
voice
I
plead
with
Jehovah
for
favor

2
Before
him
I
pour
out
my
concern
Before
him
I
tell
about
my
distress
3
When
my
spirit
fails
within
me
Then
you
watch
my
roadway
In
the
path
where
I
walk
They
hide
a
trap
for
me

4
Look
at
my
right
hand
and
seeThat
no
one
cares
about
me
There
is
nowhere
I
can
flee
No
one
is
concerned
about
me

5
I
call
to
you
O
Jehovah
for
help
I
say
You
are
my
refuge
All
I
have
in
the
land
of
the
living

6
Pay
attention
to
my
cry
for
help
For
I
have
been
brought
very
low
Rescue
me
from
my
persecutors
For
they
are
stronger
than
I
am

7
Bring
me
out
of
the
dungeonTo
praise
your
name
May
the
righteous
gather
around
meBecause
you
deal
kindly
with
me
A
melody
of
David
143
O
Jehovah
hear
my
prayer
Listen
to
my
plea
for
help
In
your
faithfulness
and
in
your
righteousness
answer
me

2
Do
not
enter
into
judgment
with
your
servant
For
no
one
living
can
be
righteous
before
you

3
For
the
enemy
pursues
me
He
has
crushed
my
life
into
the
ground
He
has
caused
me
to
dwell
in
darkness
like
those
long
dead

4
My
spirit
is
failing
My
heart
is
numb
within
me

5
I
remember
the
days
of
old
I
meditate
on
all
your
activity
I
eagerly
ponder
over
the
work
of
your
hands

6
I
spread
out
my
hands
to
you
I
am
like
a
parched
land
that
thirsts
for
you
Selah

7
Do
answer
me
quickly
O
Jehovah
My
strength
has
come
to
an
end
Do
not
hide
your
face
from
me
Or
I
will
be
like
those
going
down
into
the
pit

8
Let
me
hear
your
loyal
love
in
the
morning
For
I
trust
in
you
Make
known
to
me
the
way
I
should
walk
For
to
you
I
turn

9
Rescue
me
from
my
enemies
O
Jehovah
I
seek
your
protection
10
Teach
me
to
do
your
will
For
you
are
my
God
Your
spirit
is
good
May
it
lead
me
on
level
ground
11
For
the
sake
of
your
name
O
Jehovah
preserve
me
alive
In
your
righteousness
rescue
me
from
distress
12
In
your
loyal
love
put
an
end
to
my
enemies
Destroy
all
those
harassing
me
For
I
am
your
servant
Of
David
144
May
Jehovah
my
Rock
be
praised
Who
trains
my
hands
for
battle
My
fingers
for
warfare

2
He
is
my
loyal
love
and
my
stronghold
My
secure
refuge
and
my
rescuer
My
shield
and
the
One
in
whom
I
have
taken
shelter
The
One
subduing
peoples
under
me

3
O
Jehovah
what
is
man
that
you
should
notice
him
The
son
of
mortal
man
that
you
should
pay
attention
to
him

4
Man
resembles
a
mere
breath
His
days
are
like
a
passing
shadow

5
O
Jehovah
lower
your
heavens
and
descend
Touch
the
mountains
and
make
them
smoke

6
Make
lightning
flash
and
scatter
the
enemy
Shoot
your
arrows
and
throw
them
into
confusion

7
Stretch
out
your
hands
from
above
Rescue
me
and
save
me
from
the
surging
waters
From
the
hand
of
the
foreigners
8
Whose
mouths
speak
liesAnd
who
raise
their
right
hand
to
swear
to
what
is
false

9
O
God
I
will
sing
to
you
a
new
song
I
will
sing
praises
to
you
accompanied
by
a
ten-stringed
instrument
10
To
the
One
who
gives
victory
to
kings
The
One
rescuing
his
servant
David
from
the
deadly
sword
11
Rescue
me
and
save
me
from
the
hand
of
the
foreigners
Whose
mouths
speak
liesAnd
who
raise
their
right
hand
to
swear
to
what
is
false
12
Then
our
sons
will
be
like
young
plants
that
grow
up
quickly
Our
daughters
like
corner
pillars
carved
for
a
palace
13
Our
storehouses
will
overflow
with
every
kind
of
produce
Our
flocks
in
our
fields
will
multiply
by
the
thousands
by
the
tens
of
thousands
14
Our
cattle
heavy
with
young
will
suffer
no
mishap
or
miscarriage
There
will
be
no
cry
of
distress
in
our
public
squares
15
Happy
is
the
people
for
whom
it
is
this
way
Happy
is
the
people
whose
God
is
Jehovah
A
praise
of
David
145
I
will
exalt
you
O
my
God
the
King
I
will
praise
your
name
forever
and
ever

2
All
day
long
I
will
praise
you
I
will
praise
your
name
forever
and
ever

3
Jehovah
is
great
and
most
worthy
of
praise
His
greatness
is
unsearchable

4
Generation
after
generation
will
praise
your
works
They
will
tell
about
your
mighty
acts

5
Of
the
glorious
splendor
of
your
majesty
they
will
speakAnd
on
your
wonderful
works
I
will
meditate

6
They
will
speak
about
your
awe-inspiring
deeds
And
I
will
declare
your
greatness

7
They
will
bubble
over
as
they
recall
your
abundant
goodness
And
they
will
shout
joyfully
because
of
your
righteousness

8
Jehovah
is
compassionate
and
merciful
Slow
to
anger
and
great
in
loyal
love

9
Jehovah
is
good
to
all
And
his
mercy
is
evident
in
all
his
works
10
All
your
works
will
glorify
you
O
Jehovah
And
your
loyal
ones
will
praise
you
11
They
will
proclaim
the
glory
of
your
kingshipAnd
speak
about
your
mightiness
12
To
make
known
to
men
your
mighty
actsAnd
the
glorious
splendor
of
your
kingship
13
Your
kingship
is
an
eternal
kingship
And
your
dominion
endures
throughout
all
generations
14
Jehovah
supports
all
who
are
fallingAnd
raises
up
all
who
are
bowed
down
15
All
eyes
look
hopefully
to
you
You
give
them
their
food
in
its
season
16
You
open
your
handAnd
satisfy
the
desire
of
every
living
thing
17
Jehovah
is
righteous
in
all
his
waysAnd
loyal
in
all
that
he
does
18
Jehovah
is
near
to
all
those
calling
on
him
To
all
who
call
on
him
in
truth
19
He
satisfies
the
desire
of
those
who
fear
him
He
hears
their
cry
for
help
and
he
rescues
them
20
Jehovah
guards
all
those
who
love
him
But
all
the
wicked
he
will
annihilate
21
My
mouth
will
declare
the
praise
of
Jehovah
Let
every
living
thing
praise
his
holy
name
forever
and
ever
1
Praise
Jah
Let
my
whole
being
praise
Jehovah

2
I
will
praise
Jehovah
all
my
life
I
will
sing
praises
to
my
God
as
long
as
I
live

3
Do
not
put
your
trust
in
princesNor
in
a
son
of
man
who
cannot
bring
salvation

4
His
spirit
goes
out
he
returns
to
the
ground
On
that
very
day
his
thoughts
perish

5
Happy
is
the
one
who
has
the
God
of
Jacob
as
his
helper
Whose
hope
is
in
Jehovah
his
God
6
The
Maker
of
heaven
and
earth
Of
the
sea
and
of
all
that
is
in
them
The
One
who
always
remains
faithful
7
The
One
securing
justice
for
those
defrauded
The
One
giving
bread
to
the
hungry
Jehovah
is
releasing
the
prisoners

8
Jehovah
is
opening
the
eyes
of
the
blind
Jehovah
is
raising
up
those
bowed
down
Jehovah
loves
the
righteous

9
Jehovah
is
protecting
the
foreign
residents
He
sustains
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
But
he
thwarts
the
plans
of
the
wicked
10
Jehovah
will
be
King
forever
Your
God
O
Zion
for
generation
after
generation
Praise
Jah
1
Praise
Jah
It
is
good
to
sing
praises
to
our
God
How
pleasant
and
fitting
it
is
to
praise
him

2
Jehovah
is
building
Jerusalem
He
gathers
together
the
dispersed
ones
of
Israel

3
He
heals
the
brokenhearted
He
binds
up
their
wounds

4
He
counts
the
number
of
the
stars
He
calls
all
of
them
by
name

5
Our
Lord
is
great
and
is
mighty
in
power
His
understanding
is
beyond
measure

6
Jehovah
raises
up
the
meek
But
he
hurls
the
wicked
to
the
ground

7
Sing
to
Jehovah
with
thanksgiving
Sing
praises
to
our
God
accompanied
by
the
harp
8
The
One
who
covers
the
heavens
with
clouds
The
One
providing
rain
for
the
earth
The
One
making
grass
sprout
on
the
mountains

9
To
the
animals
he
gives
food
To
the
young
ravens
that
call
out
for
it
10
He
does
not
delight
in
the
power
of
the
horse
Nor
is
he
impressed
by
the
strong
legs
of
a
man
11
Jehovah
finds
pleasure
in
those
who
fear
him
In
those
waiting
for
his
loyal
love
12
Glorify
Jehovah
O
Jerusalem
Praise
your
God
O
Zion
13
He
makes
the
bars
of
your
city
gates
strong
He
blesses
your
sons
within
you
14
He
brings
peace
to
your
territory
He
satisfies
you
with
the
finest
wheat
15
He
sends
his
command
to
the
earth
His
word
runs
swiftly
16
He
sends
the
snow
like
wool
He
scatters
the
frost
just
like
ashes
17
He
hurls
down
his
hailstones
like
morsels
of
bread
Who
can
withstand
his
cold
18
He
sends
out
his
word
and
they
melt
He
makes
his
wind
blow
and
the
waters
flow
19
He
declares
his
word
to
Jacob
His
regulations
and
judgments
to
Israel
20
He
has
not
done
so
with
any
other
nation
They
know
nothing
about
his
judgments

a
decree
that
will
not

away

is
unreachably
high
His
majesty
is
above
earth
and
heaven

Let
them
praise

him
accompanied
by
the
tambourine
and
the

For
Jehovah
takes
pleasure
in

people
He

the
meek
with
salvation

5
Let

ones
exult
in
glory
Let

for
joy
upon

songs
praising
God

hand
7
To
execute
vengeance

This
honor

1
The
proverbs
of
Solomon
the
son
of
David
the
king
of
Israel

2
To
learn
wisdom
and
discipline
To
understand
wise
sayings
3
To
acquire
the
discipline
that
gives
insight
Righteousness
good
judgment
and
uprightness
4
To
impart
shrewdness
to
the
inexperienced
To
give
a
young
man
knowledge
and
thinking
ability

5
A
wise
person
listens
and
takes
in
more
instruction
A
man
of
understanding
acquires
skillful
direction
6
To
understand
a
proverb
and
a
puzzling
saying
The
words
of
the
wise
and
their
riddles

7
The
fear
of
Jehovah
is
the
beginning
of
knowledge
Only
fools
despise
wisdom
and
discipline

8
Listen
my
son
to
the
discipline
of
your
father
And
do
not
forsake
the
instruction
of
your
mother

9
They
are
an
attractive
wreath
for
your
headAnd
a
fine
ornament
for
your
neck
10
My
son
if
sinners
try
to
entice
you
do
not
consent
11
If
they
say
Come
with
us
Let
us
set
an
ambush
to
shed
blood
We
will
lie
hidden
waiting
for
innocent
victims
without
cause
12
We
will
swallow
them
alive
as
the
Grave
does
Whole
like
those
going
down
to
the
pit
13
Let
us
seize
all
their
precious
treasures
We
will
fill
our
houses
with
spoil
14
You
should
join
us
And
we
will
all
share
equally
what
we
steal
15
My
son
do
not
follow
them
Keep
your
feet
off
their
path
16
For
their
feet
run
to
do
evil
They
hurry
to
shed
blood
17
It
is
surely
in
vain
to
spread
a
net
in
full
sight
of
a
bird
18
That
is
why
these
lie
in
ambush
to
shed
blood
They
lie
hidden
to
take
the
lives
of
others
19
These
are
the
ways
of
those
seeking
dishonest
profit
Which
will
take
away
the
life
of
those
who
obtain
it
20
True
wisdom
cries
aloud
in
the
street
It
keeps
raising
its
voice
in
the
public
squares
21
At
the
corner
of
the
busy
streets
it
calls
out
At
the
entrances
of
the
city
gates
it
says
22
How
long
will
you
inexperienced
ones
love
inexperience
How
long
will
you
ridiculers
take
pleasure
in
ridicule
And
how
long
will
you
foolish
ones
hate
knowledge
23
Respond
to
my
reproof
Then
I
will
pour
out
my
spirit
for
you
I
will
make
my
words
known
to
you
24
Because
I
called
out
but
you
kept
refusing
I
stretched
out
my
hand
but
no
one
was
paying
attention
25
You
kept
neglecting
all
my
adviceAnd
rejecting
my
reproof
26
I
also
will
laugh
when
disaster
strikes
you
I
will
mock
when
what
you
dread
comes
27
When
what
you
dread
comes
like
a
storm
And
your
disaster
arrives
like
a
storm
wind
When
distress
and
trouble
come
upon
you
28
At
that
time
they
will
keep
calling
me
but
I
will
not
answer
They
will
eagerly
look
for
me
but
they
will
not
find
me
29
Because
they
hated
knowledge
And
they
did
not
choose
to
fear
Jehovah
30
They
refused
my
advice
They
disrespected
all
my
reproof
31
So
they
will
bear
the
consequences
of
their
way
And
they
will
be
glutted
with
their
own
counsel
32
For
the
waywardness
of
the
inexperienced
will
kill
them
And
the
complacency
of
fools
will
destroy
them
33
But
the
one
listening
to
me
will
dwell
in
securityAnd
be
undisturbed
by
the
dread
of
calamity
1
My
son
if
you
accept
my
sayingsAnd
treasure
up
my
commandments
2
By
making
your
ear
attentive
to
wisdomAnd
inclining
your
heart
to
discernment
3
Moreover
if
you
call
out
for
understandingAnd
raise
your
voice
for
discernment
4
If
you
keep
seeking
for
it
as
for
silver
And
you
keep
searching
for
it
as
for
hidden
treasures
5
Then
you
will
understand
the
fear
of
Jehovah
And
you
will
find
the
knowledge
of
God

6
For
Jehovah
himself
gives
wisdom
From
his
mouth
come
knowledge
and
discernment

7
He
treasures
up
practical
wisdom
for
the
upright
He
is
a
shield
for
those
walking
in
integrity

8
He
watches
over
the
paths
of
justice
And
he
will
guard
the
way
of
his
loyal
ones

9
Then
you
will
understand
what
is
righteous
and
just
and
fair
The
entire
course
of
what
is
good
10
When
wisdom
enters
your
heartAnd
knowledge
becomes
pleasant
to
your
soul
11
Thinking
ability
will
keep
watch
over
you
And
discernment
will
safeguard
you
12
To
save
you
from
the
bad
course
From
the
man
speaking
perverse
things
13
From
those
leaving
the
upright
pathsTo
walk
in
the
ways
of
darkness
14
From
those
who
rejoice
in
wrongdoing
Who
find
joy
in
the
perverseness
of
evil
15
Those
whose
paths
are
crookedAnd
whose
entire
course
is
devious
16
It
will
save
you
from
the
wayward
woman
From
the
smooth
words
of
the
immoral
woman
17
Who
abandons
the
close
companion
of
her
youthAnd
forgets
the
covenant
of
her
God
18
For
her
house
sinks
down
into
death
And
her
paths
lead
to
those
powerless
in
death
19
None
of
those
having
relations
with
her
will
return
Nor
will
they
regain
the
pathways
of
life
20
So
follow
the
way
of
good
peopleAnd
stay
on
the
paths
of
the
righteous
21
For
only
the
upright
will
reside
in
the
earth
And
the
blameless
will
remain
in
it
22
As
for
the
wicked
they
will
be
cut
off
from
the
earth
And
the
treacherous
will
be
torn
away
from
it
1
My
son
do
not
forget
my
teaching
And
may
your
heart
observe
my
commandments
2
Because
they
will
add
many
daysAnd
years
of
life
and
peace
to
you

3
Do
not
let
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
leave
you
Tie
them
around
your
neck
Write
them
on
the
tablet
of
your
heart
4
Then
you
will
find
favor
and
good
insightIn
the
eyes
of
God
and
man

5
Trust
in
Jehovah
with
all
your
heart
And
do
not
rely
on
your
own
understanding

6
In
all
your
ways
take
notice
of
him
And
he
will
make
your
paths
straight

7
Do
not
become
wise
in
your
own
eyes
Fear
Jehovah
and
turn
away
from
bad

8
It
will
be
a
healing
to
your
bodyAnd
refreshment
for
your
bones

9
Honor
Jehovah
with
your
valuable
things
With
the
firstfruits
of
all
your
produce
10
Then
your
storehouses
will
be
completely
filled
And
your
vats
will
overflow
with
new
wine
11
My
son
do
not
reject
the
discipline
of
Jehovah
And
do
not
loathe
his
reproof
12
For
those
whom
Jehovah
loves
he
reproves
Just
as
a
father
does
a
son
in
whom
he
delights
13
Happy
is
the
man
who
finds
wisdomAnd
the
man
who
acquires
discernment
14
To
gain
it
is
better
than
gaining
silver
And
having
it
as
profit
is
better
than
having
gold
15
It
is
more
precious
than
corals
Nothing
you
desire
can
compare
to
it
16
Long
life
is
in
its
right
hand
Riches
and
glory
are
in
its
left
hand
17
Its
ways
are
pleasant
And
all
its
paths
are
peaceful
18
It
is
a
tree
of
life
to
those
who
take
hold
of
it
And
those
who
keep
firm
hold
of
it
will
be
called
happy
19
Jehovah
founded
the
earth
in
wisdom
He
solidly
established
the
heavens
in
discernment
20
By
his
knowledge
the
watery
deeps
were
split
apartAnd
the
cloudy
skies
dripped
with
dew
21
My
son
do
not
lose
sight
of
them
Safeguard
practical
wisdom
and
thinking
ability
22
They
will
give
you
lifeAnd
be
an
adornment
for
your
neck
23
Then
you
will
walk
on
your
way
in
safety
And
your
foot
will
never
stumble
24
When
you
lie
down
you
will
have
no
fear
You
will
lie
down
and
your
sleep
will
be
pleasant
25
You
will
not
fear
any
sudden
terrorNor
the
storm
that
is
coming
on
the
wicked
26
For
Jehovah
will
prove
to
be
your
source
of
confidence
He
will
keep
your
foot
from
being
caught
27
Do
not
withhold
good
from
those
to
whom
you
should
give
itIf
it
is
within
your
power
to
help
28
Do
not
say
to
your
neighbor
Go
away
come
back
later
I
will
give
it
to
you
tomorrow

If
you
can
give
it
now
29
Do
not
plot
harm
against
your
neighborWhen
he
lives
in
a
sense
of
security
with
you
30
Do
not
quarrel
with
a
man
for
no
reasonIf
he
has
done
nothing
bad
to
you
31
Do
not
envy
the
violent
manNor
choose
any
of
his
ways
32
For
Jehovah
detests
a
devious
person
But
His
close
friendship
is
with
the
upright
33
The
curse
of
Jehovah
is
on
the
house
of
the
wicked
one
But
he
blesses
the
home
of
the
righteous
34
For
he
mocks
those
who
ridicule
But
he
shows
favor
to
the
meek
35
The
wise
will
inherit
honor
But
the
stupid
ones
glorify
dishonor
1
Listen
my
sons
to
the
discipline
of
a
father
Pay
attention
in
order
to
gain
understanding
2
For
I
will
give
you
good
instruction
Do
not
forsake
my
teaching

3
I
was
a
true
son
to
my
fatherAnd
the
one
especially
loved
by
my
mother

4
He
taught
me
and
said
May
your
heart
hold
fast
to
my
words
Keep
my
commandments
and
continue
living

5
Acquire
wisdom
acquire
understanding
Do
not
forget
and
do
not
turn
aside
from
what
I
say

6
Do
not
forsake
it
and
it
will
protect
you
Love
it
and
it
will
safeguard
you

7
Wisdom
is
the
most
important
thing
so
acquire
wisdom
And
with
all
you
acquire
acquire
understanding

8
Highly
esteem
it
and
it
will
exalt
you
It
will
honor
you
because
you
embrace
it

9
It
will
place
an
attractive
wreath
on
your
head
It
will
adorn
you
with
a
crown
of
beauty
10
Listen
my
son
and
accept
my
sayings
And
the
years
of
your
life
will
be
many
11
I
will
instruct
you
in
the
way
of
wisdom
I
will
lead
you
in
the
tracks
of
uprightness
12
When
you
walk
your
steps
will
not
be
hindered
And
if
you
run
you
will
not
stumble
13
Hold
on
to
discipline
do
not
let
it
go
Safeguard
it
for
it
means
your
life
14
Do
not
enter
the
path
of
the
wicked
And
do
not
walk
in
the
way
of
evil
men
15
Shun
it
do
not
take
it
Turn
away
from
it
and
pass
it
by
16
For
they
cannot
sleep
unless
they
do
what
is
bad
They
are
robbed
of
sleep
unless
they
cause
someones
downfall
17
They
feed
themselves
with
the
bread
of
wickedness
And
they
drink
the
wine
of
violence
18
But
the
path
of
the
righteous
is
like
the
bright
morning
lightThat
grows
brighter
and
brighter
until
full
daylight
19
The
way
of
the
wicked
is
like
the
darkness
They
do
not
know
what
makes
them
stumble
20
My
son
pay
attention
to
my
words
Listen
carefully
to
my
sayings
21
Do
not
lose
sight
of
them
Keep
them
deep
within
your
heart
22
For
they
are
life
to
those
who
find
themAnd
health
to
their
whole
body
23
Above
all
the
things
that
you
guard
safeguard
your
heart
For
out
of
it
are
the
sources
of
life
24
Put
crooked
speech
away
from
you
And
keep
devious
talk
far
away
from
you
25
Your
eyes
should
look
straight
ahead
Yes
fix
your
gaze
straight
ahead
of
you
26
Smooth
out
the
course
of
your
feet
And
all
your
ways
will
be
sure
27
Do
not
incline
to
the
right
or
the
left
Turn
your
feet
away
from
what
is
bad
1
My
son
pay
attention
to
my
wisdom
Listen
carefully
to
my
discernment
2
So
that
you
may
guard
your
thinking
abilitiesAnd
safeguard
knowledge
with
your
lips

3
For
the
lips
of
a
wayward
woman
drip
like
a
honeycomb
And
her
mouth
is
smoother
than
oil

4
But
in
the
end
she
is
as
bitter
as
wormwoodAnd
as
sharp
as
a
two-edged
sword

5
Her
feet
descend
into
death
Her
steps
lead
straight
to
the
Grave

6
She
gives
no
thought
to
the
path
of
life
Her
course
wanders
but
she
does
not
know
where

7
Now
my
sons
listen
to
meAnd
do
not
turn
away
from
what
I
am
saying

8
Stay
far
away
from
her
Do
not
go
near
the
entrance
of
her
house
9
So
that
you
may
not
give
your
dignity
to
othersNor
reap
years
of
what
is
cruel
10
So
that
strangers
may
not
drain
your
resourcesAnd
what
you
labored
for
go
to
the
house
of
a
foreigner
11
Otherwise
you
will
groan
at
the
end
of
your
lifeWhen
your
flesh
and
body
waste
away12
And
you
say
How
I
hated
discipline
How
my
heart
despised
reproof
13
I
did
not
listen
to
the
voice
of
my
instructorsOr
pay
attention
to
my
teachers
14
I
have
come
to
the
brink
of
complete
ruinIn
the
midst
of
the
entire
congregation
15
Drink
water
from
your
own
cisternAnd
flowing
water
from
your
own
well
16
Should
your
springs
be
dispersed
outside
Your
streams
of
water
in
the
public
squares
17
Let
them
be
for
you
alone
And
not
for
strangers
with
you
18
May
your
own
fountain
be
blessed
And
may
you
rejoice
with
the
wife
of
your
youth
19
A
loving
doe
a
graceful
mountain
goat
Let
her
breasts
satisfy
you
at
all
times
May
you
be
captivated
by
her
love
constantly
20
So
why
my
son
should
you
be
captivated
by
a
wayward
womanOr
embrace
the
bosom
of
an
immoral
woman
21
For
the
ways
of
man
are
before
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
He
examines
all
his
paths
22
The
wicked
one
is
ensnared
by
his
own
errors
And
he
will
be
caught
in
the
ropes
of
his
own
sin
23
He
will
die
for
lack
of
disciplineAnd
go
astray
because
of
his
excessive
foolishness
1
My
son
if
you
have
put
up
security
for
your
neighbor
If
you
have
given
your
handshake
to
a
stranger
2
If
you
have
been
ensnared
by
your
promise
Caught
by
the
words
of
your
mouth
3
Do
this
my
son
and
free
yourself
For
you
have
fallen
into
the
hand
of
your
neighbor
Go
and
humble
yourself
and
urgently
plead
with
your
neighbor

4
Do
not
allow
your
eyes
to
sleep
Nor
your
eyelids
to
slumber

5
Free
yourself
like
a
gazelle
from
the
hunters
hand
Like
a
bird
from
the
hand
of
the
birdcatcher

6
Go
to
the
ant
you
lazy
one
Observe
its
ways
and
become
wise

7
Although
it
has
no
commander
officer
or
ruler
8
It
prepares
its
food
in
the
summer
And
it
gathers
its
food
supplies
in
the
harvest

9
How
long
you
lazy
one
will
you
lie
there
When
will
you
rise
up
from
your
sleep
10
A
little
sleep
a
little
slumbering
A
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
rest
11
And
your
poverty
will
come
like
a
bandit
And
your
want
like
an
armed
man
12
A
useless
and
wicked
man
walks
about
with
crooked
speech
13
He
winks
with
his
eye
signals
with
his
foot
and
motions
with
his
fingers
14
With
a
perverted
heart
He
is
always
scheming
evil
and
spreading
contentions
15
Therefore
his
disaster
will
come
suddenly
In
a
moment
he
will
be
broken
beyond
healing
16
There
are
six
things
that
Jehovah
hates
Yes
seven
things
that
he
detests
17
Haughty
eyes
a
lying
tongue
and
hands
that
shed
innocent
blood
18
A
heart
plotting
wicked
schemes
and
feet
that
run
quickly
to
evil
19
A
false
witness
who
lies
with
every
breath
And
anyone
sowing
contentions
among
brothers
20
Observe
my
son
the
commandment
of
your
father
And
do
not
forsake
the
instruction
of
your
mother
21
Always
bind
them
around
your
heart
Tie
them
about
your
neck
22
When
you
walk
about
it
will
lead
you
When
you
lie
down
it
will
stand
guard
over
you
And
when
you
awaken
it
will
speak
to
you
23
For
the
commandment
is
a
lamp
And
the
law
is
a
light
And
the
reproofs
of
discipline
are
the
way
to
life
24
They
will
guard
you
against
the
bad
woman
Against
the
seductive
tongue
of
the
immoral
woman
25
Do
not
desire
her
beauty
in
your
heartOr
allow
her
to
captivate
you
with
her
alluring
eyes
26
For
because
of
a
prostitute
a
man
is
reduced
to
a
loaf
of
bread
But
the
wife
of
another
man
preys
on
a
precious
life
27
Can
a
man
rake
fire
to
his
chest
and
not
burn
his
garments
28
Or
can
a
man
walk
on
hot
coals
without
scorching
his
feet
29
It
is
the
same
with
anyone
having
relations
with
his
neighbors
wife
No
one
who
touches
her
will
go
unpunished
30
People
do
not
despise
a
thiefIf
he
steals
to
satisfy
himself
when
he
is
hungry
31
Yet
when
found
he
will
repay
sevenfold
He
will
give
up
all
the
valuables
of
his
house
32
Anyone
committing
adultery
with
a
woman
is
lacking
good
sense
The
one
who
does
so
brings
ruin
on
himself
33
He
will
get
only
wounds
and
dishonor
And
his
disgrace
will
not
be
wiped
away
34
For
jealousy
makes
a
husband
furious
He
will
show
no
compassion
when
he
takes
revenge
35
He
will
accept
no
compensation
He
will
not
be
appeased
no
matter
how
large
you
make
the
gift
1
My
son
keep
my
sayings
And
treasure
up
my
commandments

2
Keep
my
commandments
and
live
Guard
my
instruction
like
the
pupil
of
your
eye

3
Tie
them
around
your
fingers
Write
them
on
the
tablet
of
your
heart

4
Say
to
wisdom
You
are
my
sister

And
call
understanding
my
relative


5
To
guard
you
against
the
wayward
woman
Against
the
immoral
woman
and
her
smooth
words

6
From
the
window
of
my
house
Through
my
lattice
I
looked
down
7
And
as
I
observed
the
naive
ones
I
discerned
among
the
youths
a
young
man
lacking
good
sense

8
He
passed
along
the
street
near
her
corner
And
he
marched
in
the
direction
of
her
house
9
In
the
twilight
in
the
evening
At
the
approach
of
night
and
darkness
10
Then
I
saw
a
woman
meet
him
Dressed
like
a
prostitute
with
a
cunning
heart
11
She
is
loud
and
defiant
She
never
stays
at
home
12
One
moment
she
is
outside
next
she
is
in
the
public
squares
She
lurks
near
every
corner
13
She
grabs
hold
of
him
and
gives
him
a
kiss
With
a
bold
face
she
says
to
him
14
I
had
to
offer
communion
sacrifices
Today
I
paid
my
vows
15
That
is
why
I
came
out
to
meet
you
To
look
for
you
and
I
found
you
16
I
have
spread
fine
covers
upon
my
bed
Colorful
linen
from
Egypt
17
I
have
sprinkled
my
bed
with
myrrh
aloes
and
cinnamon
18
Come
let
us
drink
our
fill
of
love
until
the
morning
Let
us
enjoy
passionate
love
together
19
For
my
husband
is
not
at
home
He
has
gone
on
a
distant
journey
20
He
took
a
bag
of
money
with
him
And
he
will
not
return
until
the
day
of
the
full
moon
21
She
misleads
him
with
great
persuasiveness
She
seduces
him
with
smooth
speech
22
Suddenly
he
goes
after
her
like
a
bull
to
the
slaughter
Like
a
fool
to
be
punished
in
the
stocks
23
Until
an
arrow
pierces
his
liver
Like
a
bird
rushing
into
a
trap
he
does
not
know
that
it
will
cost
him
his
life
24
And
now
my
sons
listen
to
me
Pay
attention
to
the
words
I
speak
25
Do
not
let
your
heart
turn
aside
to
her
ways
Do
not
stray
onto
her
paths
26
For
she
has
caused
many
to
fall
down
slain
And
those
she
has
killed
are
numerous
27
Her
house
leads
to
the
Grave
It
goes
down
to
the
inner
chambers
of
death
1
Is
not
wisdom
calling
out
Is
not
discernment
raising
its
voice

2
On
the
heights
along
the
road
It
takes
its
position
at
the
crossroads

3
Next
to
the
gates
leading
into
the
city
At
the
entrances
of
the
doorways
It
keeps
crying
out
loudly

4
To
you
O
people
I
am
calling
I
raise
my
voice
to
everyone

5
You
inexperienced
ones
learn
shrewdness
You
stupid
ones
acquire
an
understanding
heart

6
Listen
for
what
I
say
is
important
My
lips
speak
what
is
right
7
For
my
mouth
softly
utters
truth
And
my
lips
detest
what
is
wicked

8
All
the
sayings
of
my
mouth
are
righteous
None
of
them
are
twisted
or
crooked

9
They
are
all
straightforward
to
the
discerningAnd
right
to
those
who
have
found
knowledge
10
Take
my
discipline
instead
of
silver
And
knowledge
rather
than
the
finest
gold
11
For
wisdom
is
better
than
corals
All
other
desirable
things
cannot
compare
to
it
12
I
wisdom
dwell
together
with
shrewdness
I
have
found
knowledge
and
thinking
ability
13
The
fear
of
Jehovah
means
the
hating
of
bad
I
hate
self-exaltation
and
pride
and
the
evil
way
and
perverse
speech
14
I
possess
good
advice
and
practical
wisdom
Understanding
and
power
are
mine
15
By
me
kings
keep
reigning
And
high
officials
decree
righteousness
16
By
me
princes
keep
ruling
And
nobles
judge
in
righteousness
17
I
love
those
loving
me
And
those
seeking
me
will
find
me
18
Riches
and
glory
are
with
me
Lasting
wealth
and
righteousness
19
My
fruitage
is
better
than
gold
even
refined
gold
And
what
I
produce
is
better
than
the
finest
silver
20
I
walk
in
the
path
of
righteousness
In
the
middle
of
the
pathways
of
justice
21
I
give
a
rich
inheritance
to
those
who
love
me
And
I
fill
up
their
storehouses
22
Jehovah
produced
me
as
the
beginning
of
his
way
The
earliest
of
his
achievements
of
long
ago
23
From
ancient
times
I
was
installed
From
the
start
from
times
earlier
than
the
earth
24
When
there
were
no
deep
waters
I
was
brought
forth
When
there
were
no
springs
overflowing
with
water
25
Before
the
mountains
were
set
in
place
Before
the
hills
I
was
brought
forth
26
When
he
had
not
yet
made
the
earth
and
its
fieldsOr
the
first
clods
of
earths
soil
27
When
he
prepared
the
heavens
I
was
there
When
he
marked
out
the
horizon
on
the
surface
of
the
waters
28
When
he
established
the
clouds
above
When
he
founded
the
fountains
of
the
deep
29
When
he
set
a
decree
for
the
seaThat
its
waters
should
not
pass
beyond
his
order
When
he
established
the
foundations
of
the
earth
30
Then
I
was
beside
him
as
a
master
worker
I
was
the
one
he
was
especially
fond
of
day
by
day
I
rejoiced
before
him
all
the
time
31
I
rejoiced
over
his
habitable
earth
And
I
was
especially
fond
of
the
sons
of
men
32
And
now
my
sons
listen
to
me
Yes
happy
are
those
who
keep
my
ways
33
Listen
to
discipline
and
become
wise
And
never
neglect
it
34
Happy
is
the
man
who
listens
to
meBy
coming
early
to
my
doors
day
by
day
By
waiting
next
to
my
doorposts
35
For
the
one
finding
me
will
find
life
And
he
receives
approval
from
Jehovah
36
But
the
one
who
ignores
me
harms
himself
And
those
who
hate
me
love
death
1
True
wisdom
has
built
its
house
It
has
carved
out
its
seven
pillars

2
It
has
fully
prepared
its
meat
It
has
mixed
its
wine
It
has
also
arranged
its
table

3
It
has
sent
out
its
female
servantsTo
call
out
from
the
heights
above
the
city

4
Whoever
is
inexperienced
let
him
come
in
here
She
says
to
the
one
lacking
good
sense

5
Come
eat
my
breadAnd
share
in
drinking
the
wine
that
I
have
mixed

6
Leave
behind
your
inexperience
and
live
Walk
forward
in
the
way
of
understanding

7
The
one
who
corrects
a
ridiculer
invites
dishonor
And
whoever
reproves
someone
wicked
will
get
hurt

8
Do
not
reprove
a
ridiculer
or
he
will
hate
you
Reprove
a
wise
person
and
he
will
love
you

9
Share
with
a
wise
person
and
he
will
become
wiser
Teach
someone
righteous
and
he
will
add
to
his
learning
10
The
fear
of
Jehovah
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
And
knowledge
of
the
Most
Holy
One
is
understanding
11
For
by
me
your
days
will
be
many
And
years
will
be
added
to
your
life
12
If
you
become
wise
you
are
wise
to
your
own
advantage
But
if
you
are
a
ridiculer
you
alone
will
bear
it
13
A
stupid
woman
is
loud
She
is
ignorant
and
knows
absolutely
nothing
14
She
sits
at
the
entrance
of
her
houseOn
a
seat
in
the
high
places
of
the
city
15
Calling
out
to
those
passing
by
To
those
walking
straight
ahead
on
their
way
16
Whoever
is
inexperienced
let
him
come
in
here
She
says
to
those
lacking
good
sense
17
Stolen
waters
are
sweet
And
food
eaten
in
secret
is
pleasant
18
But
he
does
not
know
that
those
powerless
in
death
are
there
That
her
guests
are
in
the
depths
of
the
Grave
1
Proverbs
of
Solomon
A
wise
son
makes
his
father
rejoice
But
a
foolish
son
is
the
grief
of
his
mother

2
The
treasures
gained
by
wickedness
will
be
of
no
benefit
But
righteousness
is
what
rescues
from
death

3
Jehovah
will
not
cause
the
righteous
one
to
go
hungry
But
he
will
deny
the
wicked
what
they
crave

4
Idle
hands
will
cause
poverty
But
diligent
hands
bring
riches

5
The
son
acting
with
insight
gathers
the
crop
in
summer
But
the
son
acting
shamefully
is
fast
asleep
during
the
harvest

6
Blessings
are
on
the
head
of
the
righteous
one
But
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
conceals
violence

7
The
memory
of
the
righteous
one
is
due
for
a
blessing
But
the
name
of
the
wicked
will
rot

8
The
wisehearted
person
will
accept
instructions
But
the
one
speaking
foolishly
will
be
trodden
down

9
The
one
walking
in
integrity
will
walk
in
security
But
the
one
making
his
ways
crooked
will
be
found
out
10
The
one
who
slyly
winks
his
eye
causes
grief
And
the
one
who
speaks
foolishly
will
be
trodden
down
11
The
mouth
of
the
righteous
one
is
a
source
of
life
But
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
conceals
violence
12
Hatred
is
what
stirs
up
contentions
But
love
covers
over
all
transgressions
13
Wisdom
is
found
on
the
lips
of
the
discerning
person
But
the
rod
is
for
the
back
of
one
lacking
good
sense
14
Those
who
are
wise
treasure
up
knowledge
But
the
mouth
of
the
fool
invites
ruin
15
The
wealth
of
a
rich
man
is
his
fortified
city
The
ruin
of
the
poor
is
their
poverty
16
The
activity
of
the
righteous
one
leads
to
life
But
the
produce
of
the
wicked
one
leads
to
sin
17
The
one
who
heeds
discipline
is
a
path
to
life
But
the
one
who
ignores
reproof
leads
others
astray
18
The
one
who
conceals
his
hatred
speaks
lies
And
the
one
spreading
malicious
reports
is
stupid
19
When
words
are
many
transgression
cannot
be
avoided
But
whoever
controls
his
lips
acts
discreetly
20
The
tongue
of
the
righteous
one
is
like
the
finest
silver
But
the
heart
of
the
wicked
one
is
worth
little
21
The
lips
of
the
righteous
one
nourish
many
But
the
foolish
die
for
lack
of
sense
22
It
is
the
blessing
of
Jehovah
that
makes
one
rich
And
He
adds
no
pain
with
it
23
Engaging
in
shameful
conduct
is
like
a
game
to
the
stupid
one
But
wisdom
is
for
the
man
of
discernment
24
What
the
wicked
one
fears
will
come
upon
him
But
the
desire
of
the
righteous
will
be
granted
25
When
the
storm
passes
by
the
wicked
one
will
be
no
more
But
the
righteous
one
is
a
foundation
forever
26
Like
vinegar
to
the
teeth
and
smoke
to
the
eyes
So
the
lazy
person
is
to
the
one
who
sends
him
27
The
fear
of
Jehovah
prolongs
life
But
the
years
of
the
wicked
will
be
cut
short
28
The
expectation
of
the
righteous
brings
joy
But
the
hope
of
the
wicked
will
perish
29
The
way
of
Jehovah
is
a
stronghold
for
the
blameless
one
But
it
means
ruin
for
evildoers
30
The
righteous
one
will
never
be
made
to
fall
But
the
wicked
will
no
longer
inhabit
the
earth
31
The
mouth
of
the
righteous
one
produces
wisdom
But
the
perverse
tongue
will
be
cut
off
32
The
lips
of
the
righteous
one
know
what
is
pleasing
But
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
is
perverse
1
Dishonest
scales
are
detestable
to
Jehovah
But
an
accurate
weight
brings
pleasure
to
him

2
When
presumptuousness
comes
dishonor
will
follow
But
wisdom
is
with
the
modest
ones

3
The
integrity
of
the
upright
is
what
guides
them
But
the
deviousness
of
the
treacherous
will
destroy
them

4
Wealth
will
be
of
no
benefit
on
the
day
of
fury
But
righteousness
is
what
will
rescue
from
death

5
The
righteousness
of
the
blameless
one
makes
his
path
straight
But
the
wicked
one
will
fall
because
of
his
own
wickedness

6
The
righteousness
of
the
upright
will
rescue
them
But
the
treacherous
will
be
caught
by
their
own
desires

7
When
a
wicked
man
dies
his
hope
perishes
And
expectations
based
on
his
power
also
perish

8
The
righteous
one
is
rescued
from
distress
And
the
wicked
one
takes
his
place

9
By
his
mouth
the
apostate
brings
his
neighbor
to
ruin
But
by
knowledge
the
righteous
are
rescued
10
The
goodness
of
the
righteous
makes
a
city
rejoice
And
when
the
wicked
perish
there
is
a
joyful
cry
11
Because
of
the
blessing
of
the
upright
a
city
is
exalted
But
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
tears
it
down
12
Whoever
is
lacking
good
sense
shows
contempt
for
his
neighbor
But
the
man
of
true
discernment
remains
silent
13
A
slanderer
goes
about
revealing
confidential
talk
But
the
trustworthy
person
keeps
a
confidence
14
When
there
is
no
skillful
direction
the
people
fall
But
there
is
success
through
many
advisers
15
Whoever
guarantees
a
loan
for
a
stranger
is
sure
to
fare
badly
But
whoever
avoids
shaking
hands
in
a
pledge
will
be
secure
16
A
gracious
woman
acquires
glory
But
ruthless
men
seize
riches
17
A
kind
man
benefits
himself
But
the
cruel
person
brings
trouble
on
himself
18
The
wicked
one
earns
deceptive
wages
But
the
one
who
sows
righteousness
receives
a
true
reward
19
The
one
standing
firmly
for
righteousness
is
in
line
for
life
But
the
one
chasing
after
evil
is
in
line
for
death
20
Those
crooked
at
heart
are
detestable
to
Jehovah
But
those
whose
way
is
blameless
bring
pleasure
to
him
21
Be
assured
of
this
An
evil
person
will
not
go
unpunished
But
the
children
of
the
righteous
will
escape
22
Like
a
gold
ring
in
the
snout
of
a
pigIs
a
beautiful
woman
who
rejects
good
sense
23
The
desire
of
the
righteous
leads
to
good
But
what
the
wicked
hope
for
leads
to
fury
24
One
gives
generously
and
ends
up
with
more
Another
withholds
what
should
be
given
but
he
comes
to
poverty
25
The
generous
person
will
prosper
And
whoever
refreshes
others
will
himself
be
refreshed
26
The
people
will
curse
the
one
who
withholds
grain
But
they
will
bless
the
one
who
sells
it
27
The
one
who
diligently
seeks
to
do
good
seeks
favor
But
the
one
searching
for
bad—that
is
what
will
surely
come
upon
him
28
The
one
trusting
in
his
riches
will
fall
But
the
righteous
will
flourish
like
the
foliage
29
Anyone
who
brings
trouble
on
his
household
will
inherit
the
wind
And
the
fool
will
be
a
servant
to
the
wisehearted
one
30
The
fruitage
of
the
righteous
one
is
a
tree
of
life
And
the
one
who
wins
souls
is
wise
31
If
indeed
the
righteous
one
on
earth
is
rewarded
How
much
more
the
wicked
one
and
the
sinner
1
The
one
who
loves
discipline
loves
knowledge
But
the
one
who
hates
reproof
is
unreasoning

2
The
good
person
obtains
Jehovahs
approval
But
He
condemns
the
man
of
wicked
schemes

3
No
man
is
made
secure
by
wickedness
But
the
righteous
will
never
be
uprooted

4
A
capable
wife
is
a
crown
to
her
husband
But
the
wife
who
acts
shamefully
is
like
rottenness
in
his
bones

5
The
thoughts
of
the
righteous
are
just
But
the
guidance
of
the
wicked
is
deceptive

6
The
words
of
the
wicked
are
a
deadly
ambush
But
the
mouth
of
the
upright
saves
them

7
When
the
wicked
are
overthrown
they
are
no
more
But
the
house
of
the
righteous
will
keep
standing

8
A
man
is
praised
for
the
discretion
of
his
mouth
But
one
with
a
twisted
heart
will
be
treated
with
contempt

9
Better
to
be
lightly
esteemed
and
have
a
servantThan
to
glorify
oneself
and
have
no
food
10
The
righteous
one
takes
care
of
his
domestic
animals
But
even
the
mercy
of
the
wicked
is
cruel
11
The
one
who
cultivates
his
land
will
be
satisfied
with
food
But
the
one
pursuing
worthless
things
is
lacking
good
sense
12
The
wicked
man
envies
what
other
evil
men
have
caught
But
the
root
of
the
righteous
bears
fruit
13
The
evil
man
is
ensnared
by
his
own
sinful
speech
But
the
righteous
one
escapes
from
distress
14
From
the
fruitage
of
his
speech
a
man
is
satisfied
with
good
And
the
work
of
his
hands
will
reward
him
15
The
way
of
the
fool
is
right
in
his
own
eyes
But
the
wise
one
accepts
advice
16
A
fool
immediately
shows
his
annoyance
But
the
shrewd
man
overlooks
an
insult
17
The
one
who
testifies
faithfully
will
tell
the
truth
But
a
false
witness
speaks
deceit
18
Thoughtless
speech
is
like
the
stabs
of
a
sword
But
the
tongue
of
the
wise
is
a
healing
19
Truthful
lips
will
endure
forever
But
a
lying
tongue
will
last
for
only
a
moment
20
Deceit
is
in
the
heart
of
those
who
plot
mischief
But
those
who
promote
peace
have
joy
21
No
harm
will
befall
the
righteous
one
But
the
wicked
will
have
their
fill
of
calamity
22
Lying
lips
are
detestable
to
Jehovah
But
those
acting
faithfully
bring
pleasure
to
him
23
A
shrewd
man
conceals
what
he
knows
But
the
heart
of
the
fool
blurts
out
his
foolishness
24
The
hand
of
the
diligent
ones
will
rule
But
idle
hands
will
be
put
to
forced
labor
25
Anxiety
in
a
mans
heart
weighs
it
down
But
a
good
word
cheers
it
up
26
The
righteous
one
searches
out
his
pastures
But
the
course
of
the
wicked
leads
them
astray
27
The
lazy
do
not
chase
after
the
prey
But
diligence
is
a
mans
precious
treasure
28
The
path
of
righteousness
leads
to
life
Along
its
pathway
there
is
no
death
1
A
wise
son
accepts
his
fathers
discipline
But
the
scoffer
does
not
listen
to
a
rebuke

2
From
the
fruitage
of
his
speech
a
man
will
eat
what
is
good
But
the
very
desire
of
the
treacherous
is
for
violence

3
The
one
guarding
his
mouth
protects
his
life
But
the
one
opening
his
lips
wide
will
come
to
ruin

4
The
lazy
person
has
his
cravings
yet
he
has
nothing
But
the
diligent
one
will
be
fully
satisfied

5
The
righteous
one
hates
lies
But
the
actions
of
the
wicked
bring
shame
and
disgrace

6
Righteousness
protects
the
one
whose
way
is
innocent
But
wickedness
brings
down
the
sinner

7
There
is
one
who
pretends
to
be
rich
yet
has
nothing
There
is
another
who
pretends
to
be
poor
yet
has
great
wealth

8
Riches
are
the
ransom
for
a
mans
life
But
the
poor
are
not
even
threatened

9
The
light
of
the
righteous
shines
brightly
But
the
lamp
of
the
wicked
will
be
extinguished
10
Presumptuousness
leads
only
to
strife
But
wisdom
belongs
to
those
who
seek
advice
11
Wealth
quickly
gained
will
dwindle
But
the
wealth
of
the
one
who
gathers
it
little
by
little
will
increase
12
Expectation
postponed
makes
the
heart
sick
But
a
desire
realized
is
a
tree
of
life
13
Whoever
despises
instruction
will
pay
the
penalty
But
the
one
who
respects
the
commandment
will
be
rewarded
14
The
teaching
of
the
wise
one
is
a
source
of
lifeTo
turn
one
away
from
the
snares
of
death
15
Keen
insight
wins
favor
But
the
way
of
the
treacherous
is
harsh
16
The
shrewd
person
acts
with
knowledge
But
the
fool
exposes
his
own
foolishness
17
A
wicked
messenger
falls
into
trouble
But
a
faithful
envoy
brings
healing
18
Whoever
neglects
discipline
comes
to
poverty
and
disgrace
But
the
one
accepting
correction
will
be
glorified
19
Desire
when
realized
is
sweet
to
a
person
But
the
stupid
hate
to
turn
away
from
bad
20
The
one
walking
with
the
wise
will
become
wise
But
the
one
who
has
dealings
with
the
stupid
will
fare
badly
21
Calamity
pursues
sinners
But
prosperity
rewards
the
righteous
22
The
good
person
leaves
an
inheritance
to
his
grandchildren
But
the
sinners
wealth
will
be
stored
up
for
the
righteous
one
23
The
plowed
field
of
the
poor
yields
much
food
But
it
may
be
swept
away
by
injustice
24
Whoever
holds
back
his
rod
hates
his
son
But
the
one
who
loves
him
disciplines
him
diligently
25
The
righteous
one
eats
and
satisfies
his
appetite
But
the
stomach
of
the
wicked
is
empty
1
The
truly
wise
woman
builds
up
her
house
But
the
foolish
one
tears
it
down
with
her
own
hands

2
The
one
walking
in
his
uprightness
fears
Jehovah
But
the
one
whose
ways
are
devious
despises
Him

3
The
rod
of
haughtiness
is
in
the
mouth
of
the
fool
But
the
lips
of
the
wise
will
protect
them

4
Where
there
are
no
cattle
the
manger
is
clean
But
the
power
of
a
bull
yields
an
abundant
harvest

5
A
faithful
witness
will
not
lie
But
a
false
witness
lies
with
every
breath

6
The
scoffer
seeks
wisdom
and
finds
none
But
knowledge
comes
easily
to
the
person
with
understanding

7
Stay
away
from
the
foolish
man
For
you
will
not
find
knowledge
on
his
lips

8
By
wisdom
the
shrewd
man
understands
the
way
he
is
going
But
the
stupid
are
deceived
by
their
foolishness

9
Fools
make
fun
of
guilt
But
among
the
upright
there
is
a
willingness
to
reconcile
10
The
heart
knows
its
own
bitterness
And
no
outsider
can
share
in
its
joy
11
The
house
of
the
wicked
will
be
destroyed
But
the
tent
of
the
upright
will
flourish
12
There
is
a
way
that
seems
right
to
a
man
But
in
the
end
it
leads
to
death
13
Even
in
laughter
the
heart
may
feel
pain
And
rejoicing
may
end
in
grief
14
The
one
wayward
at
heart
will
reap
the
results
of
his
ways
But
the
good
man
reaps
the
reward
of
his
dealings
15
The
naive
person
believes
every
word
But
the
shrewd
one
ponders
each
step
16
The
wise
one
is
cautious
and
turns
away
from
evil
But
the
stupid
one
is
reckless
and
overconfident
17
The
one
who
is
quick
to
anger
acts
foolishly
But
the
man
who
thinks
things
out
is
hated
18
The
naive
will
inherit
foolishness
But
the
shrewd
are
crowned
with
knowledge
19
Bad
people
will
have
to
bow
down
before
the
good
And
the
wicked
will
bow
at
the
gates
of
the
righteous
20
The
poor
man
is
hated
even
by
his
neighbors
But
many
are
the
friends
of
the
rich
person
21
The
one
who
despises
his
neighbor
sins
But
whoever
shows
compassion
to
the
lowly
is
happy
22
Will
not
those
who
plot
mischief
go
astray
But
those
intent
on
doing
good
will
receive
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
23
There
is
benefit
in
every
kind
of
hard
work
But
mere
talk
leads
to
want
24
The
crown
of
the
wise
is
their
wealth
But
the
foolishness
of
the
stupid
is
only
foolishness
25
A
true
witness
saves
lives
But
a
deceitful
one
lies
with
every
breath
26
There
is
strong
confidence
in
the
fear
of
Jehovah
And
it
will
be
a
refuge
for
his
children
27
The
fear
of
Jehovah
is
a
fountain
of
life
To
turn
one
away
from
the
snares
of
death
28
A
multitude
of
people
are
a
kings
majesty
But
a
ruler
without
subjects
is
ruined
29
The
one
who
is
slow
to
anger
has
great
discernment
But
the
impatient
one
displays
his
foolishness
30
A
calm
heart
gives
life
to
the
body
But
jealousy
is
rottenness
to
the
bones
31
The
one
who
defrauds
the
lowly
one
insults
his
Maker
But
whoever
shows
compassion
to
the
poor
glorifies
Him
32
The
wicked
one
will
be
brought
down
by
his
own
evil
But
the
righteous
one
will
find
refuge
in
his
integrity
33
Wisdom
rests
quietly
in
the
heart
of
an
understanding
person
But
among
the
stupid
it
must
make
itself
known
34
Righteousness
exalts
a
nation
But
sin
is
disgraceful
to
a
people
35
The
king
finds
pleasure
in
a
servant
who
acts
with
insight
But
his
fury
is
against
the
one
who
acts
shamefully
1
A
mild
answer
turns
away
rage
But
a
harsh
word
stirs
up
anger

2
The
tongue
of
the
wise
makes
good
use
of
knowledge
But
the
mouth
of
the
stupid
blurts
out
foolishness

3
The
eyes
of
Jehovah
are
everywhere
Watching
both
the
bad
and
the
good

4
A
calm
tongue
is
a
tree
of
life
But
twisted
speech
causes
despair

5
A
fool
disrespects
his
fathers
discipline
But
a
shrewd
person
accepts
correction

6
In
the
house
of
the
righteous
one
there
is
abundant
treasure
But
the
produce
of
the
wicked
one
brings
him
trouble

7
The
lips
of
the
wise
spread
knowledge
But
not
so
the
heart
of
the
stupid
one

8
The
sacrifice
of
the
wicked
is
detestable
to
Jehovah
But
the
prayer
of
the
upright
is
a
pleasure
to
Him

9
Jehovah
detests
the
way
of
the
wicked
one
But
he
loves
the
one
who
pursues
righteousness
10
Discipline
seems
bad
to
one
forsaking
the
way
But
whoever
hates
reproof
will
die
11
The
Grave
and
the
place
of
destruction
are
in
full
view
of
Jehovah
How
much
more
so
the
hearts
of
men
12
The
scoffer
does
not
love
the
one
correcting
him
He
will
not
consult
the
wise
13
A
joyful
heart
makes
for
a
cheerful
countenance
But
heartache
crushes
the
spirit
14
The
understanding
heart
seeks
knowledge
But
the
mouth
of
the
stupid
feeds
on
foolishness
15
All
the
days
of
the
afflicted
one
are
bad
But
the
one
with
a
cheerful
heart
has
a
continual
feast
16
Better
is
a
little
in
the
fear
of
JehovahThan
great
wealth
along
with
anxiety
17
Better
is
a
dish
of
vegetables
where
there
is
loveThan
a
fattened
bull
where
there
is
hatred
18
A
hot-tempered
man
stirs
up
strife
But
one
who
is
slow
to
anger
calms
a
quarrel
19
The
way
of
the
lazy
one
is
like
a
hedge
of
thorns
But
the
path
of
the
upright
is
like
a
level
highway
20
A
wise
son
makes
his
father
rejoice
But
a
stupid
man
despises
his
mother
21
Foolishness
is
a
joy
to
one
lacking
good
sense
But
the
man
of
discernment
walks
straight
ahead
22
Plans
fail
when
there
is
no
consultation
But
there
is
accomplishment
through
many
advisers
23
A
man
rejoices
in
giving
the
right
answer
And
a
word
spoken
at
the
right
time—how
good
it
is
24
The
path
of
life
leads
upward
to
one
with
insight
To
turn
him
away
from
the
Grave
below
25
Jehovah
will
tear
down
the
house
of
the
haughty
But
he
will
preserve
the
boundary
of
the
widow
26
Jehovah
detests
the
schemes
of
the
wicked
one
But
pleasant
sayings
are
pure
to
Him
27
The
one
making
dishonest
profit
brings
trouble
on
his
own
household
But
the
one
hating
bribes
will
keep
living
28
The
heart
of
the
righteous
one
meditates
before
answering
But
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
blurts
out
bad
things
29
Jehovah
is
far
away
from
the
wicked
But
he
hears
the
prayer
of
the
righteous
30
Bright
eyes
make
the
heart
rejoice
A
good
report
invigorates
the
bones
31
The
one
who
listens
to
life-giving
reproofIs
at
home
among
the
wise
32
Anyone
refusing
discipline
despises
his
life
But
whoever
listens
to
reproof
acquires
understanding
33
The
fear
of
Jehovah
is
a
training
in
wisdom
And
before
glory
there
is
humility
1
A
man
prepares
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
But
the
answer
he
gives
is
from
Jehovah

2
All
of
a
mans
ways
seem
right
to
him
But
Jehovah
examines
the
motives

3
Commit
to
Jehovah
whatever
you
do
And
your
plans
will
succeed

4
Jehovah
has
made
everything
work
for
his
purpose
Even
the
wicked
for
the
day
of
disaster

5
Everyone
proud
in
heart
is
detestable
to
Jehovah
Be
assured
that
he
will
not
go
unpunished

6
By
loyal
love
and
faithfulness
error
is
atoned
for
And
by
fearing
Jehovah
one
turns
away
from
bad

7
When
Jehovah
is
pleased
with
a
mans
ways
He
causes
even
his
enemies
to
be
at
peace
with
him

8
Better
is
a
little
with
righteousnessThan
a
large
income
without
justice

9
A
man
may
plot
out
his
course
in
his
heart
But
it
is
Jehovah
who
directs
his
steps
10
Inspired
decision
should
be
on
the
lips
of
a
king
He
must
never
betray
justice
11
Honest
balances
and
scales
are
from
Jehovah
All
the
weights
in
the
bag
are
his
doing
12
Wicked
practices
are
detestable
to
kings
For
the
throne
is
firmly
established
by
righteousness
13
Righteous
speech
is
a
pleasure
to
kings
They
love
someone
who
speaks
honestly
14
The
kings
rage
is
like
a
messenger
of
death
But
the
wise
man
appeases
it
15
In
the
light
of
the
kings
face
there
is
life
His
favor
is
like
a
cloud
of
rain
in
spring
16
How
much
better
to
acquire
wisdom
than
gold
To
gain
understanding
is
to
be
chosen
over
silver
17
The
highway
of
the
upright
avoids
what
is
bad
Whoever
safeguards
his
way
preserves
his
life
18
Pride
is
before
a
crash
And
a
haughty
spirit
before
stumbling
19
Better
to
be
humble
among
the
meekThan
to
share
the
spoil
of
the
haughty
20
The
one
who
shows
insight
in
a
matter
will
find
success
And
happy
is
the
one
trusting
in
Jehovah
21
The
wise
in
heart
will
be
called
understanding
And
the
one
kind
in
speech
adds
persuasiveness
22
Insight
is
a
fountain
of
life
to
those
possessing
it
But
fools
are
disciplined
by
their
own
foolishness
23
The
heart
of
the
wise
one
gives
his
mouth
insightAnd
adds
persuasiveness
to
his
speech
24
Pleasant
sayings
are
a
honeycomb
Sweet
to
the
soul
and
a
healing
to
the
bones
25
There
is
a
way
that
seems
right
to
a
man
But
in
the
end
it
leads
to
death
26
The
appetite
of
a
laborer
makes
him
work
hardFor
his
hunger
urges
him
on
27
A
worthless
man
digs
up
what
is
bad
His
speech
is
like
a
scorching
fire
28
A
troublemaker
causes
dissension
And
a
slanderer
separates
close
friends
29
A
violent
man
entices
his
neighborAnd
leads
him
in
the
wrong
way
30
He
winks
his
eye
as
he
schemes
harm
He
pinches
his
lips
together
as
he
carries
out
mischief
31
Gray
hair
is
a
crown
of
beautyWhen
it
is
found
in
the
way
of
righteousness
32
The
one
slow
to
anger
is
better
than
a
mighty
man
And
the
one
controlling
his
temper
than
one
conquering
a
city
33
The
lot
is
cast
into
the
lap
But
every
decision
by
it
is
from
Jehovah
1
Better
is
a
piece
of
dry
bread
where
there
is
peaceThan
a
house
full
of
feasting
along
with
quarreling

2
A
servant
with
insight
will
rule
over
a
son
who
acts
shamefully
He
will
share
in
the
inheritance
as
one
of
the
brothers

3
The
refining
pot
is
for
silver
and
the
furnace
for
gold
But
Jehovah
is
the
examiner
of
hearts

4
A
wicked
man
pays
attention
to
hurtful
speech
And
a
deceptive
man
listens
to
a
malicious
tongue

5
Whoever
mocks
the
poor
insults
his
Maker
And
whoever
rejoices
over
anothers
disaster
will
not
go
unpunished

6
Grandsons
are
a
crown
to
the
aged
And
fathers
are
the
glory
of
their
sons

7
Upright
speech
does
not
befit
a
fool
How
much
less
does
false
speech
befit
a
ruler

8
A
gift
is
like
a
precious
stone
to
its
owner
Everywhere
he
turns
it
brings
him
success

9
Whoever
forgives
a
transgression
seeks
love
But
the
one
who
keeps
harping
on
a
matter
separates
close
friends
10
A
rebuke
makes
a
deeper
impression
on
one
having
understandingThan
striking
a
stupid
person
a
hundred
times
11
A
bad
man
seeks
only
rebellion
But
a
cruel
messenger
will
be
sent
to
punish
him
12
Better
to
meet
a
bear
bereaved
of
her
cubsThan
to
encounter
someone
stupid
in
his
foolishness
13
If
anyone
repays
bad
for
good
Bad
will
not
depart
from
his
house
14
Beginning
a
fight
is
like
opening
a
floodgate
Before
the
quarrel
breaks
out
take
your
leave
15
Anyone
who
acquits
the
wicked
one
and
anyone
who
condemns
the
righteous
one—Both
of
them
are
detestable
to
Jehovah
16
What
good
is
it
that
the
stupid
one
has
the
means
to
acquire
wisdomWhen
he
has
no
heart
for
acquiring
it
17
A
true
friend
shows
love
at
all
timesAnd
is
a
brother
who
is
born
for
times
of
distress
18
A
man
lacking
good
sense
shakes
hands
and
agreesTo
put
up
security
in
the
presence
of
his
neighbor
19
The
one
who
loves
conflict
loves
transgression
Anyone
who
makes
his
entryway
high
invites
a
crash
20
The
one
who
is
crooked
at
heart
will
not
find
success
And
the
one
who
speaks
deceitfully
will
fall
into
ruin
21
The
one
who
fathers
a
stupid
child
will
experience
grief
And
the
father
of
a
senseless
child
has
no
joy
22
A
joyful
heart
is
good
medicine
But
a
crushed
spirit
saps
ones
strength
23
A
wicked
man
will
take
a
bribe
in
secretTo
pervert
the
course
of
justice
24
Wisdom
is
directly
in
front
of
the
discerning
person
But
the
eyes
of
the
stupid
wander
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
25
A
stupid
son
brings
grief
to
his
fatherAnd
heartache
to
the
one
who
gave
birth
to
him
26
To
punish
the
righteous
one
is
not
good
And
to
flog
honorable
people
goes
against
what
is
right
27
A
man
of
knowledge
restrains
his
words
And
a
discerning
man
will
remain
calm
28
Even
a
fool
who
keeps
silent
will
be
considered
wise
And
the
one
who
seals
his
lips
discerning
1
Whoever
isolates
himself
pursues
his
own
selfish
desires
He
rejects
all
practical
wisdom

2
A
stupid
person
takes
no
pleasure
in
understanding
He
would
rather
disclose
what
is
in
his
heart

3
When
a
wicked
person
comes
contempt
also
comes
And
along
with
dishonor
there
is
disgrace

4
The
words
of
a
mans
mouth
are
deep
waters
The
fountain
of
wisdom
is
a
bubbling
brook

5
It
is
not
good
to
show
partiality
to
the
wicked
oneOr
to
deprive
the
righteous
one
of
justice

6
The
speech
of
the
stupid
one
leads
to
quarrels
And
his
mouth
invites
a
beating

7
The
mouth
of
the
stupid
is
his
ruin
And
his
lips
are
a
snare
for
his
life

8
The
words
of
a
slanderer
are
like
tasty
morsels
They
are
gulped
right
down
into
the
stomach

9
Whoever
is
lazy
in
his
workIs
a
brother
to
the
one
who
causes
ruin
10
The
name
of
Jehovah
is
a
strong
tower
Into
it
the
righteous
one
runs
and
receives
protection
11
The
wealth
of
the
rich
is
his
fortified
city
It
is
like
a
protective
wall
in
his
imagination
12
Before
a
crash
a
mans
heart
is
lofty
And
before
glory
there
is
humility
13
When
anyone
replies
to
a
matter
before
he
hears
the
facts
It
is
foolish
and
humiliating
14
A
persons
spirit
can
sustain
him
through
illness
But
who
can
bear
a
crushed
spirit
15
The
heart
of
the
understanding
one
acquires
knowledge
And
the
ear
of
the
wise
seeks
to
find
knowledge
16
A
mans
gift
opens
the
way
for
him
It
gives
him
access
to
great
people
17
The
first
to
state
his
case
seems
right
Until
the
other
party
comes
and
cross-examines
him
18
Casting
lots
puts
an
end
to
disputesAnd
decides
between
strong
opponents
19
A
brother
offended
is
more
unyielding
than
a
fortified
city
And
there
are
disputes
like
the
bars
of
a
fortress
20
From
the
fruitage
of
a
mans
speech
his
stomach
will
be
filled
He
will
be
satisfied
with
what
his
lips
produce
21
Death
and
life
are
in
the
power
of
the
tongue
Those
who
love
to
use
it
will
eat
its
fruitage
22
The
one
who
finds
a
good
wife
has
found
something
good
And
he
receives
Jehovahs
favor
23
The
poor
man
implores
when
speaking
But
the
rich
man
answers
harshly
24
There
are
companions
ready
to
crush
one
another
But
there
is
a
friend
who
sticks
closer
than
a
brother
1
It
is
better
to
be
poor
and
walk
in
integrityThan
to
be
stupid
and
speak
lies

2
A
person
without
knowledge
is
not
good
And
the
one
who
acts
rashly
is
sinning

3
It
is
a
mans
own
foolishness
that
distorts
his
way
And
his
heart
becomes
enraged
against
Jehovah

4
Wealth
attracts
many
friends
But
the
poor
man
will
be
deserted
even
by
his
friend

5
A
false
witness
will
not
go
unpunished
And
the
one
who
lies
with
every
breath
will
not
escape

6
Many
seek
the
favor
of
a
noble
And
everyone
is
a
friend
to
the
man
who
gives
gifts

7
All
the
brothers
of
a
poor
man
hate
him
How
much
more
he
is
shunned
by
his
friends
He
pursues
them
with
requests
but
no
one
responds

8
Whoever
acquires
good
sense
loves
himself
Whoever
treasures
discernment
will
find
success

9
A
false
witness
will
not
go
unpunished
And
the
one
who
lies
with
every
breath
will
perish
10
It
is
not
fitting
for
a
fool
to
live
in
luxury
How
much
less
for
a
servant
to
rule
over
princes
11
The
insight
of
a
man
certainly
slows
down
his
anger
And
it
is
beauty
on
his
part
to
overlook
an
offense
12
The
kings
rage
is
like
the
growling
of
a
lion
But
his
favor
is
like
dew
on
the
vegetation
13
A
stupid
son
brings
adversity
on
his
father
And
a
quarrelsome
wife
is
like
a
roof
that
never
stops
leaking
14
A
house
and
wealth
are
inherited
from
fathers
But
a
discreet
wife
is
from
Jehovah
15
Laziness
brings
on
a
deep
sleep
And
a
sluggish
person
will
go
hungry
16
The
one
who
keeps
the
commandment
keeps
his
life
The
one
who
is
reckless
about
his
ways
will
die
17
The
one
showing
favor
to
the
lowly
is
lending
to
Jehovah
And
He
will
repay
him
for
what
he
does
18
Discipline
your
son
while
there
is
hope
And
do
not
become
responsible
for
his
death
19
The
hot-tempered
man
will
pay
the
penalty
If
you
try
to
spare
him
you
will
have
to
do
it
again
and
again
20
Listen
to
counsel
and
accept
discipline
In
order
to
become
wise
in
your
future
21
Many
are
the
plans
in
a
mans
heart
But
the
counsel
of
Jehovah
is
what
will
prevail
22
The
desirable
thing
in
a
man
is
his
loyal
love
And
it
is
better
to
be
poor
than
to
be
a
liar
23
The
fear
of
Jehovah
leads
to
life
The
one
who
has
it
will
have
a
pleasant
rest
free
from
harm
24
The
lazy
one
buries
his
hand
in
the
banquet
bowl
But
he
does
not
even
bother
to
bring
it
back
to
his
mouth
25
Strike
the
ridiculer
so
that
the
inexperienced
one
may
become
shrewd
And
reprove
the
understanding
one
so
that
he
will
increase
in
knowledge
26
The
one
who
mistreats
his
father
and
drives
away
his
motherIs
a
son
causing
shame
and
disgrace
27
My
son
if
you
stop
listening
to
discipline
You
will
stray
from
the
sayings
of
knowledge
28
A
worthless
witness
mocks
justice
And
the
mouth
of
the
wicked
gulps
down
evil
29
Judgment
is
in
store
for
ridiculers
And
beatings
for
the
back
of
the
stupid
ones
1
Wine
is
a
ridiculer
alcohol
is
unruly
Whoever
goes
astray
by
them
is
not
wise

2
The
terror
of
a
king
is
like
the
growling
of
a
lion
Whoever
provokes
his
anger
risks
his
own
life

3
It
is
honorable
for
a
man
to
refrain
from
a
dispute
But
every
fool
will
become
embroiled
in
it

4
The
lazy
one
does
not
plow
in
winter
So
he
will
be
begging
during
the
harvest
when
he
has
nothing

5
The
thoughts
of
a
mans
heart
are
like
deep
waters
But
the
discerning
man
draws
them
out

6
Many
men
proclaim
their
loyal
love
But
who
can
find
a
faithful
man

7
The
righteous
one
is
walking
in
his
integrity
Happy
are
his
children
who
come
after
him

8
When
the
king
sits
on
the
throne
to
judge
He
sifts
out
all
evil
with
his
eyes

9
Who
can
say
I
have
cleansed
my
heart
I
am
pure
from
my
sin
10
Dishonest
weights
and
false
measures—Both
are
detestable
to
Jehovah
11
Even
a
child
is
known
by
his
actions
Whether
his
behavior
is
pure
and
right
12
The
hearing
ear
and
the
seeing
eye—Jehovah
has
made
both
of
them
13
Do
not
love
sleep
or
you
will
come
to
poverty
Open
your
eyes
and
you
will
be
satisfied
with
bread
14
It
is
no
good
it
is
no
good
says
the
buyer
Then
he
goes
away
and
boasts
about
himself
15
There
is
gold
also
much
coral
But
the
lips
of
knowledge
are
something
precious
16
Take
a
mans
garment
if
he
has
given
security
for
a
stranger
Seize
the
pledge
from
him
if
he
did
so
for
a
foreign
woman
17
Bread
gained
by
deceit
tastes
good
to
a
man
But
afterward
his
mouth
will
be
full
of
gravel
18
By
consultation
plans
will
succeed
And
by
skillful
direction
wage
your
war
19
A
slanderer
goes
about
revealing
confidential
talk
Do
not
associate
with
one
who
loves
to
gossip
20
Whoever
curses
his
father
and
his
mother
His
lamp
will
be
extinguished
when
darkness
comes
21
An
inheritance
obtained
first
by
greedWill
not
be
a
blessing
in
the
end
22
Do
not
say
I
will
pay
back
evil
Hope
in
Jehovah
and
he
will
save
you
23
Dishonest
weights
are
detestable
to
Jehovah
And
deceptive
scales
are
not
good
24
A
mans
footsteps
are
directed
by
Jehovah
How
can
a
man
understand
his
own
way
25
It
is
a
snare
for
a
man
to
cry
out
rashly
Holy
And
only
later
to
give
consideration
to
what
he
vowed
26
A
wise
king
sifts
out
the
wickedAnd
drives
the
threshing
wheel
over
them
27
The
breath
of
a
man
is
the
lamp
of
Jehovah
Searching
through
his
innermost
being
28
Loyal
love
and
faithfulness
safeguard
the
king
By
loyal
love
he
sustains
his
throne
29
The
glory
of
young
men
is
their
strength
And
the
splendor
of
old
men
is
their
gray
hair
30
Bruises
and
wounds
purge
away
evil
And
beatings
cleanse
ones
innermost
being
1
A
kings
heart
is
like
streams
of
water
in
Jehovahs
hand
He
directs
it
wherever
He
pleases

2
All
of
a
mans
ways
seem
right
to
him
But
Jehovah
examines
the
hearts

3
To
do
what
is
right
and
justIs
more
pleasing
to
Jehovah
than
a
sacrifice

4
Haughty
eyes
and
an
arrogant
heart—The
lamp
that
guides
the
wicked
is
sin

5
The
plans
of
the
diligent
surely
lead
to
success
But
all
who
are
hasty
surely
head
for
poverty

6
Gaining
treasures
by
a
lying
tongueIs
like
a
vanishing
mist
a
deadly
snare

7
The
violence
of
the
wicked
will
sweep
them
away
For
they
refuse
to
act
with
justice

8
The
way
of
a
guilty
man
is
crooked
But
the
activity
of
the
pure
man
is
upright

9
Better
to
dwell
on
a
corner
of
the
roofThan
in
the
same
house
with
a
quarrelsome
wife
10
The
wicked
man
craves
what
is
bad
He
shows
no
favor
toward
his
neighbor
11
When
a
ridiculer
is
punished
the
inexperienced
become
wiser
And
when
a
wise
person
receives
insight
he
gains
knowledge
12
The
Righteous
One
observes
the
house
of
the
wicked
one
He
overthrows
the
wicked
to
their
ruin
13
Whoever
stops
up
his
ear
to
the
cry
of
the
lowly
oneWill
himself
call
and
not
be
answered
14
A
secret
gift
subdues
anger
And
a
hidden
bribe
fierce
rage
15
It
is
a
joy
for
the
righteous
one
to
act
with
justice
But
it
is
something
terrible
to
those
who
practice
evil
16
The
man
who
strays
from
the
way
of
insightWill
rest
in
the
company
of
those
powerless
in
death
17
The
one
who
loves
having
a
good
time
will
come
to
poverty
The
one
who
loves
wine
and
oil
will
not
grow
rich
18
The
wicked
one
is
a
ransom
for
the
righteous
one
And
the
treacherous
one
will
be
taken
in
place
of
the
upright
19
Better
to
dwell
in
the
wildernessThan
with
a
quarrelsome
and
irritable
wife
20
Precious
treasure
and
oil
are
found
in
the
house
of
the
wise
But
the
stupid
man
will
squander
what
he
has
21
Whoever
pursues
righteousness
and
loyal
loveWill
find
life
righteousness
and
glory
22
A
wise
man
can
scale
the
city
of
the
mightyAnd
undermine
the
strength
in
which
they
trust
23
The
one
guarding
his
mouth
and
his
tongueKeeps
himself
out
of
trouble
24
A
presumptuous
arrogant
braggart
is
what
you
callThe
man
who
acts
with
reckless
presumptuousness
25
What
the
lazy
man
craves
will
put
him
to
death
For
his
hands
refuse
to
work
26
All
day
long
he
greedily
craves
But
the
righteous
one
gives
holding
nothing
back
27
The
sacrifice
of
the
wicked
is
detestable
How
much
more
when
he
offers
it
with
evil
intent
28
A
lying
witness
will
perish
But
the
man
who
listens
will
testify
with
success
29
The
wicked
man
puts
on
a
bold
face
But
it
is
the
upright
one
whose
course
is
sure
30
There
is
no
wisdom
nor
discernment
nor
counsel
in
opposition
to
Jehovah
31
The
horse
is
prepared
for
the
day
of
battle
But
salvation
belongs
to
Jehovah
1
A
good
name
is
to
be
chosen
rather
than
great
wealth
To
be
respected
is
better
than
silver
and
gold

2
The
rich
and
the
poor
have
this
in
common
Jehovah
made
them
both

3
The
shrewd
one
sees
the
danger
and
conceals
himself
But
the
inexperienced
keep
right
on
going
and
suffer
the
consequences

4
The
result
of
humility
and
the
fear
of
JehovahIs
riches
and
glory
and
life

5
Thorns
and
traps
are
in
the
crooked
mans
path
But
whoever
values
his
life
keeps
far
away
from
them

6
Train
a
boy
in
the
way
he
should
go
Even
when
he
grows
old
he
will
not
depart
from
it

7
The
rich
one
rules
the
poor
And
the
borrower
is
a
slave
to
the
lender

8
Whoever
sows
unrighteousness
will
reap
disaster
And
the
rod
of
his
fury
will
come
to
its
end

9
The
generous
person
will
be
blessed
For
he
shares
his
food
with
the
poor
10
Drive
away
the
scornful
man
And
contention
will
disappear
Disputes
and
insults
will
cease
11
The
one
who
loves
a
pure
heart
and
whose
speech
is
graciousWill
have
the
king
as
his
friend
12
The
eyes
of
Jehovah
safeguard
knowledge
But
He
overturns
the
words
of
the
treacherous
13
The
lazy
one
says
There
is
a
lion
outside
I
will
be
killed
in
the
middle
of
the
public
square
14
The
mouth
of
wayward
women
is
a
deep
pit
The
one
condemned
by
Jehovah
will
fall
into
it
15
Foolishness
is
bound
up
in
the
heart
of
a
boy
But
the
rod
of
discipline
will
remove
it
far
from
him
16
The
one
defrauding
the
poor
to
increase
his
wealthAnd
the
one
giving
gifts
to
the
richWill
end
up
in
poverty
17
Incline
your
ear
and
listen
to
the
words
of
the
wise
In
order
to
apply
your
heart
to
my
knowledge
18
For
it
is
pleasant
to
keep
them
deep
within
you
So
that
all
of
them
may
constantly
be
on
your
lips
19
For
your
confidence
to
be
in
Jehovah
I
am
giving
you
knowledge
today
20
Have
I
not
already
written
you
Imparting
advice
and
knowledge
21
To
teach
you
true
and
reliable
words
So
that
you
can
return
with
an
accurate
report
to
the
one
who
sent
you
22
Do
not
rob
the
poor
man
because
he
is
poor
And
do
not
crush
the
lowly
man
in
the
city
gate
23
For
Jehovah
himself
will
plead
their
causeAnd
he
will
take
the
life
of
those
who
defraud
them
24
Do
not
keep
company
with
a
hot-tempered
manOr
get
involved
with
one
disposed
to
rage
25
So
that
you
never
learn
his
waysAnd
ensnare
yourself
26
Do
not
be
among
those
who
shake
hands
in
a
pledge
Who
put
up
security
for
loans
27
If
you
have
nothing
to
pay
Your
bed
will
be
taken
right
out
from
under
you
28
Do
not
move
an
ancient
boundary
markerThat
your
forefathers
put
in
place
29
Have
you
seen
a
man
skillful
at
his
work
He
will
stand
before
kings
He
will
not
stand
before
common
men
1
When
you
sit
down
to
eat
with
a
king
Carefully
consider
what
is
before
you
2
Put
a
knife
to
your
throatIf
you
have
a
large
appetite

3
Do
not
crave
his
delicacies
For
it
is
deceptive
food

4
Do
not
wear
yourself
out
to
gain
wealth
Stop
and
show
understanding

5
When
you
cast
your
eyes
on
it
it
is
not
there
For
it
will
surely
sprout
wings
like
an
eagle
and
fly
off
into
the
sky

6
Do
not
eat
the
food
of
a
stingy
person
Do
not
crave
his
delicacies
7
For
he
is
like
one
keeping
accounts
Eat
and
drink

he
says
to
you
but
he
does
not
mean
it

8
You
will
vomit
up
the
morsels
you
have
eatenAnd
will
have
wasted
your
compliments

9
Do
not
speak
in
the
ears
of
the
stupid
one
For
he
will
despise
the
wisdom
of
your
words
10
Do
not
move
an
ancient
boundary
markerOr
encroach
on
the
field
of
the
fatherless
11
For
their
Defender
is
strong
He
will
take
up
their
cause
against
you
12
Apply
your
heart
to
disciplineAnd
your
ear
to
the
sayings
of
knowledge
13
Do
not
hold
back
discipline
from
a
boy
If
you
strike
him
with
the
rod
he
will
not
die
14
With
the
rod
you
should
strike
him
In
order
to
save
him
from
the
Grave
15
My
son
if
your
heart
becomes
wise
Then
my
own
heart
will
rejoice
16
My
innermost
being
will
find
joyWhen
your
lips
speak
what
is
right
17
Let
your
heart
not
envy
sinners
But
be
in
the
fear
of
Jehovah
all
day
long
18
For
then
you
will
have
a
futureAnd
your
hope
will
not
be
cut
off
19
Listen
my
son
and
become
wise
And
direct
your
heart
in
the
right
way
20
Do
not
be
among
those
who
drink
too
much
wine
Among
those
who
gorge
themselves
on
meat
21
For
a
drunkard
and
a
glutton
will
come
to
poverty
And
drowsiness
will
clothe
one
with
rags
22
Listen
to
your
father
who
caused
your
birth
And
do
not
despise
your
mother
just
because
she
has
grown
old
23
Buy
truth
and
never
sell
it
Also
wisdom
and
discipline
and
understanding
24
The
father
of
a
righteous
one
will
surely
be
joyful
Whoever
fathers
a
wise
son
will
rejoice
in
him
25
Your
father
and
your
mother
will
rejoice
And
she
who
gave
birth
to
you
will
be
joyful
26
My
son
do
give
your
heart
to
me
And
may
your
eyes
take
pleasure
in
my
ways
27
For
a
prostitute
is
a
deep
pit
And
an
immoral
woman
is
a
narrow
well
28
She
lies
in
wait
like
a
robber
She
increases
the
number
of
unfaithful
men
29
Who
has
woe
Who
has
uneasiness
Who
has
quarrels
Who
has
complaints
Who
has
wounds
for
no
reason
Who
has
bleary
eyes
30
Those
lingering
long
over
wine
Those
searching
out
mixed
wine
31
Do
not
look
at
the
wines
red
colorAs
it
sparkles
in
the
cup
and
goes
down
smoothly
32
For
in
the
end
it
bites
like
a
serpent
And
it
secretes
poison
like
a
viper
33
Your
eyes
will
see
strange
things
And
your
heart
will
speak
perverse
things
34
And
you
will
be
like
one
lying
down
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
Like
one
lying
at
the
top
of
a
ships
mast
35
You
will
say
They
have
struck
me
but
I
did
not
feel
it
They
beat
me
but
I
did
not
know
it
When
will
I
wake
up
I
need
another
drink
1
Do
not
envy
evil
men
And
do
not
crave
their
company
2
For
their
heart
meditates
on
violence
And
their
lips
speak
of
trouble

3
By
wisdom
a
house
is
built
up
And
by
discernment
it
is
made
secure

4
By
knowledge
its
rooms
are
filledWith
all
sorts
of
precious
and
pleasant
treasures

5
A
wise
man
is
powerful
And
with
knowledge
a
man
increases
his
power

6
By
skillful
direction
you
will
wage
your
war
And
through
many
advisers
there
is
victory

7
True
wisdom
is
unattainable
for
a
fool
He
has
nothing
to
say
in
the
city
gate

8
Anyone
who
plots
evilWill
be
called
a
master
schemer

9
Foolish
schemes
are
sinful
And
people
detest
a
ridiculer
10
If
you
become
discouraged
in
the
day
of
distress
Your
strength
will
be
meager
11
Rescue
those
who
are
being
taken
away
to
death
And
hold
back
those
staggering
to
the
slaughter
12
If
you
say
But
we
did
not
know
about
this

Does
not
the
One
who
examines
hearts
discern
it
Yes
the
One
who
watches
you
will
knowAnd
will
repay
each
man
according
to
his
activity
13
My
son
eat
honey
because
it
is
good
Honey
from
the
comb
is
sweet
to
the
taste
14
Likewise
know
that
wisdom
is
good
for
you
If
you
find
it
you
will
have
a
futureAnd
your
hope
will
not
be
cut
off
15
Do
not
wickedly
lie
in
ambush
near
the
home
of
the
righteous
one
Do
not
destroy
his
place
of
rest
16
For
the
righteous
one
may
fall
seven
times
and
he
will
get
up
again
But
the
wicked
will
be
made
to
stumble
by
calamity
17
When
your
enemy
falls
do
not
rejoice
And
when
he
stumbles
do
not
let
your
heart
be
joyful
18
Otherwise
Jehovah
will
see
and
be
displeased
And
He
will
turn
away
his
anger
from
him
19
Do
not
be
upset
because
of
evil
men
Do
not
envy
wicked
people
20
For
there
is
no
future
for
anyone
evil
The
lamp
of
the
wicked
will
be
extinguished
21
My
son
fear
Jehovah
and
the
king
And
do
not
associate
with
dissenters
22
For
their
disaster
will
arise
suddenly
Who
knows
what
ruin
both
will
bring
upon
them
23
These
sayings
also
belong
to
the
wise
Partiality
in
judgment
is
not
good
24
Whoever
says
to
the
wicked
one
You
are
righteous

Will
be
cursed
by
the
peoples
and
denounced
by
the
nations
25
But
it
will
go
well
for
those
reproving
him
Blessings
of
good
things
will
come
upon
them
26
People
will
kiss
the
lips
of
the
one
replying
honestly
27
Prepare
your
outside
work
and
get
everything
ready
in
the
field
Then
build
your
house
28
Do
not
testify
against
your
neighbor
without
grounds
Do
not
use
your
lips
to
deceive
others
29
Do
not
say
I
will
do
to
him
just
as
he
has
done
to
me
I
will
repay
him
for
what
he
did
30
I
passed
by
the
field
of
the
lazy
one
By
the
vineyard
of
the
man
lacking
good
sense
31
I
saw
that
it
was
overgrown
with
weeds
The
ground
was
covered
with
nettles
And
its
stone
wall
was
broken
down
32
I
observed
this
and
took
it
to
heart
I
saw
it
and
learned
this
lesson
33
A
little
sleep
a
little
slumbering
A
little
folding
of
the
hands
to
rest
34
And
your
poverty
will
come
like
a
bandit
And
your
want
like
an
armed
man
1
These
also
are
the
proverbs
of
Solomon
which
the
men
of
Hezekiah
the
king
of
Judah
transcribed

2
It
is
the
glory
of
God
to
keep
a
matter
secret
And
the
glory
of
kings
is
to
search
through
a
matter

3
As
the
heavens
are
high
and
the
earth
is
deep
So
the
heart
of
kings
is
unsearchable

4
Remove
the
dross
from
the
silver
And
it
will
emerge
completely
refined

5
Remove
the
wicked
one
from
the
kings
presence
And
his
throne
will
be
firmly
established
in
righteousness

6
Do
not
honor
yourself
before
the
king
And
do
not
take
a
place
among
the
prominent
7
For
it
is
better
for
him
to
say
to
you
Come
up
here

Than
to
humiliate
you
in
the
presence
of
a
noble

8
Do
not
rush
into
a
legal
dispute
For
what
will
you
do
later
if
your
neighbor
humiliates
you

9
Plead
your
case
with
your
neighbor
But
do
not
reveal
what
you
were
told
confidentially
10
So
that
the
one
listening
will
not
put
you
to
shameAnd
you
spread
a
bad
report
that
cannot
be
recalled
11
Like
apples
of
gold
in
silver
carvingsIs
a
word
spoken
at
the
right
time
12
Like
an
earring
of
gold
and
an
ornament
of
fine
goldIs
a
wise
reprover
to
the
receptive
ear
13
Just
like
the
coldness
of
snow
on
the
day
of
harvestIs
a
faithful
messenger
to
those
who
sent
him
For
he
refreshes
his
master
14
Like
clouds
and
wind
that
bring
no
rainIs
a
man
who
boasts
about
a
gift
never
given
15
By
patience
a
commander
is
won
over
And
a
gentle
tongue
can
break
a
bone
16
If
you
find
honey
eat
only
what
you
need
For
if
you
take
too
much
you
may
vomit
it
up
17
Rarely
set
foot
in
your
neighbors
house
So
that
he
does
not
get
tired
of
you
and
hate
you
18
Like
a
war
club
and
a
sword
and
a
sharp
arrowIs
a
man
bearing
false
witness
against
his
neighbor
19
Like
a
broken
tooth
or
an
unsteady
footIs
confidence
in
an
unreliable
person
in
times
of
trouble
20
Like
one
who
removes
a
garment
on
a
cold
dayAnd
like
vinegar
poured
on
sodaIs
the
one
who
sings
songs
to
a
gloomy
heart
21
If
your
enemy
is
hungry
give
him
bread
to
eat
If
he
is
thirsty
give
him
water
to
drink
22
For
you
will
be
heaping
burning
coals
on
his
head
And
Jehovah
will
reward
you
23
The
north
wind
brings
a
downpour
And
a
gossiping
tongue
brings
an
angry
face
24
Better
to
dwell
on
a
corner
of
the
roofThan
in
the
same
house
with
a
quarrelsome
wife
25
Like
cold
water
on
a
tired
soulIs
a
good
report
from
a
distant
land
26
Like
a
muddied
spring
and
a
ruined
wellIs
a
righteous
person
who
gives
in
to
a
wicked
one
27
It
is
not
good
to
eat
too
much
honey
Nor
is
it
glorious
to
seek
ones
own
glory
28
As
a
city
broken
through
without
a
wall
Is
the
man
who
cannot
control
his
temper
1
Like
snow
in
summer
and
rain
at
harvesttime
Honor
is
not
fitting
for
someone
stupid

2
Just
as
a
bird
has
reason
to
flee
and
a
swallow
to
fly
So
a
curse
does
not
come
without
a
real
reason

3
A
whip
is
for
the
horse
a
bridle
is
for
the
donkey
And
the
rod
is
for
the
back
of
stupid
people

4
Do
not
answer
the
stupid
one
according
to
his
foolishness
So
that
you
do
not
put
yourself
on
his
level

5
Answer
the
stupid
one
according
to
his
foolishness
So
that
he
does
not
think
he
is
wise

6
Like
someone
who
cripples
his
own
feet
and
harms
himselfIs
the
one
who
entrusts
matters
to
someone
stupid

7
Like
the
limp
legs
of
the
lame
So
is
a
proverb
in
the
mouth
of
stupid
people

8
Like
tying
a
stone
to
a
sling
So
is
giving
glory
to
someone
stupid

9
Like
a
thorn
plant
that
comes
into
the
hand
of
a
drunkard
So
is
a
proverb
in
the
mouth
of
stupid
people
10
Like
an
archer
who
wounds
at
random
So
is
the
one
who
hires
the
stupid
one
or
those
passing
by
11
Like
a
dog
that
returns
to
its
vomit
The
stupid
one
repeats
his
foolishness
12
Have
you
seen
a
man
who
thinks
he
is
wise
There
is
more
hope
for
someone
stupid
than
for
him
13
The
lazy
one
says
There
is
a
young
lion
in
the
road
A
lion
in
the
public
square
14
A
door
keeps
turning
on
its
hinges
And
the
lazy
one
on
his
bed
15
The
lazy
one
buries
his
hand
in
the
banquet
bowl
But
he
is
too
tired
to
bring
it
back
to
his
mouth
16
The
lazy
one
thinks
he
is
wiserThan
seven
people
who
give
a
sensible
reply
17
Like
someone
grabbing
hold
of
a
dogs
earsIs
the
one
passing
by
who
becomes
furious
about
a
quarrel
that
is
not
his
18
Like
a
madman
who
shoots
fiery
missiles
arrows
and
death19
Is
the
man
who
plays
a
trick
on
his
neighbor
and
says
I
was
only
joking
20
Where
there
is
no
wood
the
fire
goes
out
And
where
there
is
no
slanderer
quarreling
ceases
21
As
charcoal
for
the
embers
and
wood
for
the
fire
So
a
contentious
man
kindles
a
quarrel
22
The
words
of
a
slanderer
are
like
tasty
morsels
They
are
gulped
right
down
into
the
stomach
23
Like
a
silver
glazing
over
a
piece
of
earthenwareAre
affectionate
words
from
an
evil
heart
24
The
one
who
hates
others
disguises
it
with
his
lips
But
inside
he
harbors
deceit
25
Although
he
speaks
graciously
do
not
trust
him
For
there
are
seven
detestable
things
in
his
heart
26
Though
his
hatred
is
concealed
by
deceit
His
evil
will
be
exposed
in
the
congregation
27
The
one
who
digs
a
pit
will
fall
into
it
And
whoever
rolls
away
a
stone—it
will
come
back
on
him
28
A
lying
tongue
hates
those
crushed
by
it
And
a
flattering
mouth
causes
ruin
1
Do
not
boast
about
tomorrow
For
you
do
not
know
what
a
day
will
bring

2
Let
someone
else
praise
you
and
not
your
own
mouth
Others
and
not
your
own
lips

3
A
stone
is
heavy
and
sand
is
weighty
But
the
irritation
caused
by
a
fool
is
heavier
than
both

4
There
is
the
cruelty
of
rage
and
the
flood
of
anger
But
who
can
withstand
jealousy

5
Open
reproof
is
better
than
concealed
love

6
The
wounds
inflicted
by
a
friend
are
faithful
But
an
enemys
kisses
are
plentiful

7
One
whose
appetite
is
satisfied
turns
down
honey
from
the
comb
But
to
the
hungry
even
what
is
bitter
tastes
sweet

8
Like
a
bird
that
strays
from
its
nestIs
a
man
who
strays
from
his
home

9
Oil
and
incense
make
the
heart
rejoice
So
does
sweet
friendship
springing
from
sincere
counsel
10
Do
not
forsake
your
friend
or
your
fathers
friend
And
do
not
enter
your
own
brothers
house
on
the
day
of
your
disaster
Better
is
a
neighbor
nearby
than
a
brother
far
away
11
Be
wise
my
son
and
make
my
heart
rejoice
So
that
I
can
make
a
reply
to
him
who
taunts
me
12
The
shrewd
person
sees
the
danger
and
conceals
himself
But
the
inexperienced
keep
right
on
going
and
suffer
the
consequences
13
Take
a
mans
garment
if
he
has
given
security
for
a
stranger
Seize
the
pledge
from
him
if
he
did
so
for
a
foreign
woman
14
When
someone
blesses
his
fellow
man
with
a
loud
voice
early
in
the
morning
It
will
be
counted
as
a
curse
to
him
15
A
quarrelsome
wife
is
like
a
constantly
leaking
roof
on
a
rainy
day
16
Whoever
can
restrain
her
can
restrain
the
windAnd
can
grip
oil
with
his
right
hand
17
As
iron
sharpens
iron
So
one
man
sharpens
his
friend
18
The
one
who
cares
for
a
fig
tree
will
eat
its
fruit
And
the
one
who
takes
care
of
his
master
will
be
honored
19
As
water
reflects
ones
face
So
the
heart
of
one
man
reflects
anothers
20
The
Grave
and
the
place
of
destruction
are
never
satisfied
Nor
are
a
mans
eyes
ever
satisfied
21
As
the
refining
pot
is
for
silver
and
the
furnace
for
gold
So
a
person
is
tested
by
the
praise
he
receives
22
Even
if
you
pound
a
fool
with
a
pestleLike
crushed
grain
in
a
mortar
His
foolishness
will
not
leave
him
23
You
should
know
well
the
appearance
of
your
flock
Take
good
care
of
your
sheep
24
For
wealth
does
not
last
forever
Nor
a
crown
for
all
generations
25
The
green
grass
disappears
new
grass
appears
And
the
vegetation
of
the
mountains
is
gathered
in
26
The
young
rams
provide
your
clothing
And
the
male
goats
provide
the
price
of
a
field
27
And
there
will
be
enough
goats
milk
to
feed
you
To
feed
your
household
and
to
sustain
your
servant
girls
1
The
wicked
flee
when
no
one
pursues
them
But
the
righteous
are
as
confident
as
a
lion

2
When
there
is
transgression
in
the
land
it
will
have
one
prince
after
another
But
with
the
help
of
a
man
of
discernment
and
knowledge
a
prince
will
long
endure

3
A
poor
man
who
defrauds
the
lowlyIs
like
a
rain
that
sweeps
away
all
the
food

4
Those
who
abandon
the
law
praise
the
wicked
one
But
those
who
observe
the
law
are
indignant
with
them

5
Evil
men
cannot
understand
justice
But
those
who
seek
Jehovah
can
understand
everything

6
Better
is
a
poor
man
who
walks
in
his
integrityThan
a
rich
man
whose
ways
are
corrupt

7
An
understanding
son
observes
the
law
But
a
companion
of
gluttons
disgraces
his
father

8
The
one
who
increases
his
wealth
by
interest
and
usuryAmasses
it
for
the
one
who
shows
favor
to
the
poor

9
The
one
refusing
to
listen
to
the
law—Even
his
prayer
is
detestable
10
The
one
misleading
the
upright
into
an
evil
course
will
fall
into
his
own
pit
But
the
blameless
will
inherit
what
is
good
11
A
rich
man
is
wise
in
his
own
eyes
But
a
poor
man
with
discernment
can
see
through
him
12
When
the
righteous
triumph
there
is
great
glory
But
when
the
wicked
rise
to
power
people
go
into
hiding
13
The
one
covering
over
his
transgressions
will
not
succeed
But
whoever
confesses
and
abandons
them
will
be
shown
mercy
14
Happy
is
the
man
who
is
always
on
guard
But
whoever
hardens
his
heart
will
fall
into
calamity
15
Like
a
growling
lion
and
a
charging
bearIs
a
wicked
ruler
over
a
helpless
people
16
A
leader
without
discernment
abuses
his
power
But
the
one
hating
dishonest
profit
will
prolong
his
life
17
A
man
burdened
with
bloodguilt
for
taking
someones
life
will
keep
fleeing
until
the
grave
Let
no
one
support
him
18
The
one
walking
faultlessly
will
be
saved
But
the
one
whose
ways
are
crooked
will
suddenly
fall
19
The
one
cultivating
his
ground
will
have
plenty
of
bread
But
the
one
taking
up
worthless
pursuits
will
have
his
fill
of
poverty
20
A
faithful
man
will
receive
many
blessings
But
the
one
hastening
to
get
rich
will
not
remain
innocent
21
It
is
not
good
to
show
partiality
But
a
man
might
do
wrong
for
a
piece
of
bread
22
An
envious
man
is
eager
for
wealth
Not
knowing
that
poverty
will
overtake
him
23
Whoever
reproves
a
man
will
afterward
find
more
favorThan
someone
who
flatters
with
his
tongue
24
Whoever
robs
his
father
and
mother
and
says
It
is
not
wrong

Is
a
partner
of
the
man
who
causes
ruin
25
The
greedy
person
stirs
up
dissension
But
whoever
relies
on
Jehovah
will
prosper
26
Whoever
trusts
in
his
own
heart
is
stupid
But
the
one
who
walks
in
wisdom
will
escape
27
Whoever
gives
to
the
poor
will
lack
nothing
But
the
one
who
closes
his
eyes
to
them
will
receive
many
curses
28
When
the
wicked
rise
to
power
a
man
hides
himself
But
when
they
perish
the
righteous
increase
1
A
man
who
stiffens
his
neck
after
much
reproofWill
suddenly
be
broken
beyond
healing

2
When
the
righteous
are
many
the
people
rejoice
But
when
the
wicked
one
rules
the
people
groan

3
A
man
who
loves
wisdom
makes
his
father
rejoice
But
the
one
who
keeps
company
with
prostitutes
squanders
his
wealth

4
By
justice
a
king
brings
stability
to
a
land
But
a
man
seeking
bribes
brings
it
to
ruin

5
A
man
who
flatters
his
neighborSpreads
out
a
net
for
his
feet

6
A
bad
mans
transgression
ensnares
him
But
the
righteous
one
cries
out
joyfully
and
rejoices

7
The
righteous
one
is
concerned
about
the
legal
rights
of
the
poor
But
the
wicked
one
has
no
such
concern

8
Boastful
men
inflame
a
town
But
those
who
are
wise
turn
away
anger

9
When
a
wise
man
enters
into
a
controversy
with
a
fool
There
will
be
ranting
and
ridicule
but
no
satisfaction
10
Bloodthirsty
men
hate
anyone
innocent
And
they
seek
to
take
the
life
of
the
upright
11
A
stupid
person
gives
vent
to
all
his
feelings
But
the
wise
one
calmly
keeps
them
in
check
12
When
a
ruler
pays
attention
to
lies
All
his
servants
will
be
wicked
13
The
poor
man
and
the
oppressor
have
this
in
common
Jehovah
gives
light
to
the
eyes
of
both
14
When
a
king
judges
the
poor
fairly
His
throne
will
always
be
secure
15
The
rod
and
reproof
impart
wisdom
But
a
child
left
unrestrained
brings
shame
on
his
mother
16
When
the
wicked
increase
transgression
increases
But
the
righteous
will
see
their
downfall
17
Discipline
your
son
and
he
will
bring
you
rest
And
he
will
give
you
great
pleasure
18
Where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
go
unrestrained
But
happy
are
those
who
observe
the
law
19
A
servant
will
not
let
himself
be
corrected
by
words
For
though
he
understands
he
does
not
obey
20
Have
you
seen
a
man
hasty
with
his
words
There
is
more
hope
for
a
fool
than
for
him
21
If
a
servant
is
pampered
from
his
youth
He
will
become
thankless
later
on
22
A
man
prone
to
anger
stirs
up
strife
Anyone
disposed
to
rage
commits
many
transgressions
23
The
haughtiness
of
a
man
will
humble
him
But
whoever
is
humble
in
spirit
will
obtain
glory
24
The
partner
of
a
thief
hates
himself
He
may
hear
the
call
to
testify
but
he
reports
nothing
25
Trembling
at
men
is
a
snare
But
the
one
trusting
in
Jehovah
will
be
protected
26
Many
seek
an
audience
with
a
ruler
But
it
is
from
Jehovah
that
a
man
gets
justice
27
An
unjust
man
is
detestable
to
the
righteous
But
the
one
whose
way
is
upright
is
detestable
to
the
wicked
one
1
The
weighty
message
contained
in
the
words
of
Agur
son
of
Jakeh
which
he
spoke
to
Ithiel
to
Ithiel
and
Ucal

2
I
am
more
ignorant
than
anyone
else
And
I
lack
the
understanding
a
man
should
have

3
I
have
not
learned
wisdom
And
I
do
not
possess
the
knowledge
of
the
Most
Holy
One

4
Who
has
ascended
to
heaven
and
then
descended
Who
has
gathered
the
wind
in
the
palms
of
both
hands
Who
has
wrapped
up
the
waters
in
his
garment
Who
has
established
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
What
is
his
name
and
the
name
of
his
son—if
you
know

5
Every
saying
of
God
is
refined
He
is
a
shield
to
those
taking
refuge
in
him

6
Add
nothing
to
his
words
Or
he
will
reprove
you
And
you
will
be
proved
a
liar

7
Two
things
I
ask
of
you
Do
not
withhold
them
from
me
before
I
die

8
Remove
untruth
and
lies
far
from
me
Give
me
neither
poverty
nor
riches
Just
let
me
consume
my
portion
of
food
9
So
that
I
do
not
become
satisfied
and
deny
you
and
say
Who
is
Jehovah
Nor
let
me
become
poor
and
steal
and
dishonor
the
name
of
my
God
10
Do
not
slander
a
servant
to
his
master
Or
he
may
curse
you
and
you
will
be
found
guilty
11
There
is
a
generation
that
curses
its
fatherAnd
does
not
bless
its
mother
12
There
is
a
generation
that
is
pure
in
its
own
eyesBut
has
not
been
cleansed
from
its
filth
13
There
is
a
generation
whose
eyes
are
so
haughtyAnd
whose
eyes
look
so
arrogantly
14
There
is
a
generation
whose
teeth
are
swordsAnd
whose
jaws
are
slaughtering
knives
They
devour
the
lowly
ones
of
the
earthAnd
the
poor
from
among
mankind
15
The
leeches
have
two
daughters
that
cry
Give
Give
There
are
three
things
that
do
not
get
satisfied
Four
that
never
say
Enough
16
—The
Grave
and
a
barren
womb
A
land
that
is
deprived
of
water
And
fire
that
never
says
Enough
17
The
eye
that
mocks
a
father
and
despises
obedience
to
a
mother—The
ravens
of
the
valley
will
peck
it
out
And
the
young
eagles
will
eat
it
up
18
There
are
three
things
that
are
beyond
my
comprehension
And
four
that
I
do
not
understand
19
The
way
of
an
eagle
in
the
heavens
The
way
of
a
serpent
on
a
rock
The
way
of
a
ship
in
the
open
sea
And
the
way
of
a
man
with
a
young
woman
20
This
is
the
way
of
an
adulterous
woman
She
eats
she
wipes
her
mouth
Then
she
says
I
have
done
nothing
wrong
21
There
are
three
things
that
make
the
earth
shudderAnd
four
things
it
cannot
endure
22
When
a
slave
rules
as
king
When
a
fool
is
glutted
with
food
23
When
a
hated
woman
is
taken
as
a
wife
And
when
a
servant
girl
takes
the
place
of
her
mistress
24
Four
things
on
earth
are
among
the
smallest
But
they
are
instinctively
wise
25
The
ants
are
not
strong
creatures
Yet
they
prepare
their
food
in
the
summer
26
The
rock
badgers
are
not
mighty
creatures
Yet
they
make
their
house
in
the
crags
27
The
locusts
have
no
king
Yet
they
all
go
forward
in
formation
28
The
gecko
lizard
clings
with
its
feet
And
it
goes
into
the
palace
of
a
king
29
There
are
three
things
that
have
an
impressive
stride
Four
that
are
impressive
as
they
move
30
The
lion
the
mightiest
among
beasts
Which
does
not
retreat
from
anyone
31
The
greyhound
the
male
goat
And
a
king
whose
army
is
with
him
32
If
you
have
foolishly
exalted
yourselfOr
if
you
have
schemed
to
do
so
Put
your
hand
over
your
mouth
33
For
as
the
churning
of
milk
produces
butterAnd
the
squeezing
of
the
nose
produces
blood
So
the
stirring
up
of
anger
produces
quarrels
1
The
words
of
King
Lemuel
the
weighty
message
his
mother
gave
to
instruct
him

2
What
should
I
tell
you
O
my
son
What
O
son
of
my
womb
And
what
O
son
of
my
vows

3
Do
not
give
your
vigor
to
women
Nor
follow
ways
that
destroy
kings

4
It
is
not
for
kings
O
Lemuel
It
is
not
for
kings
to
drink
wineNor
for
rulers
to
say
Where
is
my
drink

5
So
that
they
do
not
drink
and
forget
what
is
decreedAnd
pervert
the
rights
of
the
lowly
ones

6
Give
alcohol
to
those
who
are
perishingAnd
wine
to
those
in
bitter
distress

7
Let
them
drink
and
forget
their
poverty
Let
them
remember
their
trouble
no
more

8
Speak
up
in
behalf
of
the
speechless
Defend
the
rights
of
all
who
are
perishing

9
Speak
up
and
judge
righteously
Defend
the
rights
of
the
lowly
and
the
poor
10
Who
can
find
a
capable
wife
Her
value
is
far
more
than
that
of
corals
11
Her
husband
trusts
her
from
his
heart
And
he
lacks
nothing
of
value
12
She
rewards
him
with
good
not
bad
All
the
days
of
her
life
13
She
obtains
wool
and
linen
She
delights
to
work
with
her
hands
14
She
is
like
the
ships
of
a
merchant
Bringing
her
food
in
from
afar
15
She
also
rises
while
it
is
still
night
Providing
food
for
her
householdAnd
portions
for
her
female
servants
16
She
sets
her
mind
on
a
field
and
buys
it
She
plants
a
vineyard
from
her
own
labors
17
She
prepares
herself
for
hard
work
And
she
strengthens
her
arms
18
She
sees
that
her
trading
is
profitable
Her
lamp
does
not
go
out
at
night
19
Her
hands
seize
the
distaff
And
her
hands
take
hold
of
the
spindle
20
She
extends
her
palm
to
the
lowly
one
And
she
opens
her
hands
to
the
poor
21
She
does
not
worry
about
her
household
because
of
the
snow
For
her
whole
household
is
clothed
in
warm
garments
22
She
makes
her
own
bed
covers
Her
clothing
is
of
linen
and
purple
wool
23
Her
husband
is
well-known
in
the
city
gates
Where
he
sits
among
the
elders
of
the
land
24
She
makes
and
sells
linen
garmentsAnd
supplies
belts
to
the
merchants
25
She
is
clothed
with
strength
and
splendor
And
she
looks
to
the
future
with
confidence
26
She
opens
her
mouth
in
wisdom
The
law
of
kindness
is
on
her
tongue
27
She
watches
over
the
activity
of
her
household
And
the
bread
of
laziness
she
does
not
eat
28
Her
children
rise
up
and
declare
her
happy
Her
husband
rises
up
and
praises
her
29
There
are
many
capable
women
But
you—you
surpass
them
all
30
Charm
may
be
false
and
beauty
may
be
fleeting
But
the
woman
who
fears
Jehovah
will
be
praised
31
Give
her
the
reward
for
what
she
does
And
let
her
works
praise
her
in
the
city
gates
1
The
words
of
the
congregator
the
son
of
David
the
king
in
Jerusalem

2
The
greatest
futility
says
the
congregator
The
greatest
futility
Everything
is
futile

3
What
does
a
person
gain
from
all
his
hard
workAt
which
he
toils
under
the
sun

4
A
generation
is
going
and
a
generation
is
coming
But
the
earth
remains
forever

5
The
sun
rises
and
the
sun
sets
Then
it
hurries
back
to
the
place
where
it
rises
again

6
The
wind
goes
south
and
circles
around
to
the
north
Round
and
round
it
continuously
circles
the
wind
keeps
making
its
rounds

7
All
the
streams
flow
into
the
sea
yet
the
sea
is
not
full
To
the
place
from
which
the
streams
flow
there
they
return
so
as
to
flow
again

8
All
things
are
wearisome
No
one
can
even
speak
of
it
The
eye
is
not
satisfied
at
seeing
Nor
is
the
ear
filled
from
hearing

9
What
has
been
is
what
will
be
And
what
has
been
done
will
be
done
again
There
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
10
Is
there
anything
of
which
one
may
say
Look
at
this—it
is
new
It
already
existed
from
long
ago
It
already
existed
before
our
time
11
No
one
remembers
people
of
former
times
Nor
will
anyone
remember
those
who
come
later
Nor
will
they
be
remembered
by
those
who
come
still
later
12
I
the
congregator
have
been
king
over
Israel
in
Jerusalem
13
I
set
my
heart
to
study
and
explore
with
wisdom
everything
that
has
been
done
under
the
heavens—the
miserable
occupation
that
God
has
given
to
the
sons
of
men
that
keeps
them
occupied
14
I
saw
all
the
works
that
were
done
under
the
sun
And
look
everything
was
futile
a
chasing
after
the
wind
15
What
is
crooked
cannot
be
made
straight
And
what
is
lacking
cannot
possibly
be
counted
16
Then
I
said
in
my
heart
Look
I
have
acquired
great
wisdom
more
than
anyone
who
was
before
me
in
Jerusalem
and
my
heart
gained
a
great
deal
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
17
I
applied
my
heart
to
knowing
wisdom
and
to
knowing
madness
and
to
knowing
folly
and
this
too
is
a
chasing
after
the
wind
18
For
an
abundance
of
wisdom
brings
an
abundance
of
frustration
So
that
whoever
increases
knowledge
increases
pain
1
Then
I
said
in
my
heart
Come
and
let
me
try
out
pleasure
and
see
what
good
comes
But
look
that
too
was
futility

2
I
said
about
laughter
It
is
madness
And
about
pleasure
What
use
is
it
3
I
explored
with
my
heart
by
indulging
myself
with
wine
all
the
while
maintaining
my
own
wisdom
I
even
embraced
foolishness
to
find
out
what
was
the
best
thing
for
humans
to
do
during
their
few
days
of
life
under
the
heavens
4
I
undertook
great
works
I
built
houses
for
myself
I
planted
vineyards
for
myself
5
I
made
gardens
and
parks
for
myself
and
I
planted
in
them
all
sorts
of
fruit
trees
6
I
made
pools
of
water
for
myself
to
irrigate
a
grove
of
flourishing
trees
7
I
acquired
male
and
female
servants
and
I
had
servants
born
in
my
household
I
also
acquired
much
livestock—cattle
and
flocks—more
than
any
of
my
predecessors
in
Jerusalem
8
I
accumulated
silver
and
gold
for
myself
the
treasures
of
kings
and
of
provinces
I
gathered
male
and
female
singers
for
myself
as
well
as
what
brings
great
pleasure
to
the
sons
of
men—a
woman
yes
many
women
9
So
I
grew
great
and
surpassed
anyone
prior
to
me
in
Jerusalem
And
my
wisdom
remained
with
me
10
I
did
not
deny
myself
anything
that
I
desired
I
did
not
withhold
from
my
heart
any
sort
of
pleasure
for
my
heart
was
joyful
because
of
all
my
hard
work
and
this
was
my
reward
for
all
my
hard
work
11
But
when
I
reflected
on
all
the
works
that
my
own
hands
had
done
and
on
all
the
hard
work
that
I
had
toiled
to
accomplish
I
saw
that
everything
was
futile
a
chasing
after
the
wind
there
was
nothing
of
real
value
under
the
sun
12
Then
I
turned
my
attention
to
wisdom
and
madness
and
folly
For
what
can
the
man
do
who
comes
after
the
king
Only
what
has
already
been
done
13
And
I
saw
that
there
is
an
advantage
to
wisdom
over
folly
just
as
there
is
an
advantage
to
light
over
darkness
14
The
wise
one
has
his
eyes
in
his
head
but
the
stupid
one
is
walking
in
darkness
I
have
also
come
to
realize
that
there
is
one
outcome
that
befalls
all
of
them
15
Then
I
said
in
my
heart
What
happens
to
the
stupid
one
will
also
happen
to
me
What
then
did
I
gain
by
becoming
excessively
wise
So
I
said
in
my
heart
This
too
is
futility
16
For
there
is
no
lasting
memory
either
of
the
wise
one
or
of
the
stupid
one
In
the
days
to
come
everyone
will
be
forgotten
And
how
will
the
wise
one
die
Along
with
the
stupid
one
17
So
I
came
to
hate
life
because
everything
being
done
under
the
sun
seemed
distressing
to
me
for
everything
was
futile
a
chasing
after
the
wind
18
I
came
to
hate
all
that
I
had
worked
so
hard
for
under
the
sun
because
I
must
leave
it
behind
for
the
man
coming
after
me
19
And
who
knows
whether
he
will
be
wise
or
foolish
Yet
he
will
take
control
over
all
the
things
I
spent
great
effort
and
wisdom
to
acquire
under
the
sun
This
too
is
futility
20
So
I
began
to
despair
in
my
heart
over
all
the
hard
work
at
which
I
had
toiled
under
the
sun
21
For
a
man
may
work
hard
guided
by
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
skill
but
he
must
hand
over
his
portion
to
a
man
who
did
not
work
for
it
This
too
is
futility
and
a
great
tragedy
22
What
does
a
man
really
gain
from
all
his
hard
work
and
ambition
that
drives
him
to
work
hard
under
the
sun
23
For
during
all
his
days
his
occupation
brings
pain
and
frustration
and
even
at
night
his
heart
does
not
rest
This
too
is
futility
24
There
is
nothing
better
for
a
man
than
to
eat
and
drink
and
find
enjoyment
in
his
hard
work
This
too
I
have
realized
is
from
the
hand
of
the
true
God
25
for
who
eats
and
who
drinks
better
than
I
do
26
To
the
man
who
pleases
him
he
gives
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
rejoicing
but
to
the
sinner
he
gives
the
occupation
of
gathering
and
merely
collecting
to
give
to
the
one
who
pleases
the
true
God
This
too
is
futility
a
chasing
after
the
wind
1
There
is
an
appointed
time
for
everything
A
time
for
every
activity
under
the
heavens

2
A
time
for
birth
and
a
time
to
die
A
time
to
plant
and
a
time
to
uproot
what
was
planted
3
A
time
to
kill
and
a
time
to
heal
A
time
to
tear
down
and
a
time
to
build
up
4
A
time
to
weep
and
a
time
to
laugh
A
time
to
wail
and
a
time
to
dance
5
A
time
to
throw
stones
away
and
a
time
to
gather
stones
together
A
time
to
embrace
and
a
time
to
refrain
from
embracing
6
A
time
to
search
and
a
time
to
give
up
as
lost
A
time
to
keep
and
a
time
to
throw
away
7
A
time
to
rip
apart
and
a
time
to
sew
together
A
time
to
be
silent
and
a
time
to
speak
8
A
time
to
love
and
a
time
to
hate
A
time
for
war
and
a
time
for
peace
9
What
does
the
worker
gain
from
all
his
efforts
10
I
have
seen
the
occupation
that
God
has
given
to
the
sons
of
men
to
keep
them
occupied
11
He
has
made
everything
beautiful
in
its
time
He
has
even
put
eternity
in
their
heart
yet
mankind
will
never
find
out
the
work
that
the
true
God
has
made
from
start
to
finish
12
I
have
concluded
that
there
is
nothing
better
for
them
than
to
rejoice
and
to
do
good
during
their
life
13
also
that
everyone
should
eat
and
drink
and
find
enjoyment
for
all
his
hard
work
It
is
the
gift
of
God
14
I
have
come
to
know
that
everything
the
true
God
makes
will
endure
forever
There
is
nothing
to
add
to
it
and
nothing
to
subtract
from
it
The
true
God
has
made
it
this
way
so
that
people
will
fear
him
15
Whatever
happens
has
already
happened
and
what
is
to
come
has
already
been
but
the
true
God
seeks
what
has
been
pursued
16
I
have
also
seen
this
under
the
sun
In
the
place
of
justice
there
was
wickedness
and
in
the
place
of
righteousness
there
was
wickedness
17
So
I
said
in
my
heart
The
true
God
will
judge
both
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
for
there
is
a
time
for
every
activity
and
every
action
18
I
also
said
in
my
heart
about
the
sons
of
men
that
the
true
God
will
test
them
and
show
them
that
they
are
like
animals
19
for
there
is
an
outcome
for
humans
and
an
outcome
for
animals
they
all
have
the
same
outcome
As
the
one
dies
so
the
other
dies
and
they
all
have
but
one
spirit
So
man
has
no
superiority
over
animals
for
everything
is
futile
20
All
are
going
to
the
same
place
They
all
come
from
the
dust
and
they
all
are
returning
to
the
dust
21
Who
really
knows
whether
the
spirit
of
humans
ascends
upward
and
whether
the
spirit
of
animals
descends
down
to
the
earth
22
And
I
saw
that
there
is
nothing
better
than
for
a
man
to
find
enjoyment
in
his
work
because
that
is
his
reward
for
who
can
enable
him
to
see
what
will
happen
after
he
is
gone
1
Again
I
turned
my
attention
to
all
the
acts
of
oppression
that
go
on
under
the
sun
I
saw
the
tears
of
the
oppressed
and
there
was
no
one
to
comfort
them
And
their
oppressors
had
the
power
and
there
was
no
one
to
comfort
them
2
And
I
congratulated
the
dead
who
had
already
died
rather
than
the
living
who
were
still
alive
3
And
better
off
than
both
of
them
is
the
one
who
has
not
yet
been
born
who
has
not
seen
the
distressing
deeds
that
are
done
under
the
sun
4
And
I
have
seen
how
much
effort
and
skillful
work
spring
from
rivalry
between
people
this
too
is
futility
a
chasing
after
the
wind
5
The
stupid
one
folds
his
hands
while
his
flesh
wastes
away
6
Better
is
a
handful
of
rest
than
two
handfuls
of
hard
work
and
chasing
after
the
wind
7
I
turned
my
attention
to
another
example
of
futility
under
the
sun
8
There
is
a
man
who
is
all
alone
without
any
companion
he
has
no
son
or
brother
but
there
is
no
end
to
all
his
hard
work
His
eyes
are
never
satisfied
with
riches
But
does
he
ask
himself
For
whom
am
I
working
hard
and
depriving
myself
of
good
things
This
too
is
futility
and
a
miserable
occupation
9
Two
are
better
than
one
because
they
have
a
good
reward
for
their
hard
work
10
For
if
one
of
them
falls
the
other
can
help
his
partner
up
But
what
will
happen
to
the
one
who
falls
with
no
one
to
help
him
up
11
Moreover
if
two
lie
down
together
they
will
stay
warm
but
how
can
just
one
keep
warm
12
And
someone
may
overpower
one
alone
but
two
together
can
take
a
stand
against
him
And
a
threefold
cord
cannot
quickly
be
torn
apart
13
Better
is
a
poor
but
wise
child
than
an
old
but
stupid
king
who
no
longer
has
enough
sense
to
heed
a
warning
14
For
he
went
out
from
prison
to
become
king
although
in
that
ones
kingship
he
was
born
poor
15
I
considered
all
those
alive
who
walk
about
under
the
sun
as
well
as
how
it
goes
with
the
young
successor
who
stands
up
in
the
others
place
16
Although
there
is
no
end
to
all
his
supporters
those
who
come
later
will
not
be
happy
with
him
This
too
is
futility
a
chasing
after
the
wind
1
Watch
your
step
whenever
you
go
to
the
house
of
the
true
God
it
is
better
to
draw
near
to
listen
than
to
give
a
sacrifice
as
the
stupid
ones
do
for
they
are
not
aware
that
what
they
are
doing
is
bad
2
Do
not
be
quick
with
your
mouth
nor
let
your
heart
speak
rashly
before
the
true
God
for
the
true
God
is
in
the
heavens
but
you
are
on
the
earth
That
is
why
your
words
should
be
few
3
For
a
dream
comes
from
too
many
preoccupations
and
the
chatter
of
the
stupid
one
comes
from
too
many
words
4
Whenever
you
make
a
vow
to
God
do
not
delay
to
pay
it
for
he
finds
no
pleasure
in
the
stupid
ones
What
you
vow
pay
5
Better
for
you
not
to
vow
than
to
vow
and
not
pay
6
Do
not
allow
your
mouth
to
cause
you
to
sin
and
do
not
say
before
the
angel
that
it
was
a
mistake
Why
make
the
true
God
indignant
over
what
you
say
so
that
he
has
to
destroy
the
work
of
your
hands
7
For
just
as
many
preoccupations
lead
to
dreams
so
too
many
words
lead
to
futility
But
fear
the
true
God
8
If
you
see
any
oppression
of
the
poor
and
a
violation
of
justice
and
righteousness
in
your
district
do
not
be
surprised
about
the
matter
For
that
high
official
is
being
watched
by
one
who
is
higher
than
he
is
and
there
are
others
who
are
still
higher
than
them
9
Also
the
profit
of
the
land
is
divided
among
them
all
even
the
king
is
served
by
the
field
10
A
lover
of
silver
will
never
be
satisfied
with
silver
nor
a
lover
of
wealth
with
income
This
too
is
futility
11
When
good
things
increase
those
consuming
them
increase
And
what
advantage
is
it
to
the
owner
except
to
look
at
them
with
his
eyes
12
Sweet
is
the
sleep
of
the
one
serving
whether
he
eats
little
or
much
but
the
plenty
belonging
to
the
rich
one
does
not
permit
him
to
sleep
13
There
is
a
great
tragedy
that
I
have
seen
under
the
sun
riches
that
were
hoarded
by
their
owner
to
his
own
harm
14
Those
riches
were
lost
because
of
a
disastrous
venture
and
when
he
becomes
a
father
to
a
son
he
has
nothing
left
in
his
possession
15
Just
as
one
came
from
his
mothers
womb
naked
he
will
go
away
just
as
he
came
And
he
cannot
carry
away
anything
for
all
his
hard
work
16
This
too
is
a
great
tragedy
Exactly
as
he
came
so
he
will
go
away
and
what
profit
is
there
to
the
one
who
keeps
working
hard
for
the
wind
17
Also
every
day
he
eats
in
darkness
with
a
great
deal
of
frustration
and
sickness
and
anger
18
This
is
what
I
have
seen
to
be
good
and
proper
that
one
should
eat
and
drink
and
find
enjoyment
for
all
the
hard
work
at
which
he
toils
under
the
sun
during
the
few
days
of
life
that
the
true
God
has
given
him
for
that
is
his
reward
19
Also
when
the
true
God
gives
a
man
riches
and
material
possessions
along
with
the
ability
to
enjoy
them
he
should
take
his
reward
and
rejoice
in
his
hard
work
This
is
the
gift
of
God
20
For
he
will
hardly
notice
the
passing
days
of
his
life
because
the
true
God
keeps
him
preoccupied
with
the
rejoicing
of
his
heart
1
There
is
another
tragedy
that
I
have
seen
under
the
sun
and
it
is
common
among
men
2
The
true
God
gives
a
man
riches
and
material
possessions
and
glory
so
that
he
lacks
nothing
that
he
desires
yet
the
true
God
does
not
enable
him
to
enjoy
them
although
a
stranger
may
enjoy
them
This
is
futility
and
a
severe
affliction
3
If
a
man
should
become
a
father
a
hundred
times
and
live
for
many
years
and
reach
old
age
yet
he
does
not
enjoy
his
good
things
before
he
reaches
the
grave
I
must
say
that
a
stillborn
child
is
better
off
than
he
is
4
For
this
one
came
in
vain
and
went
away
in
darkness
and
his
name
is
shrouded
in
darkness
5
Even
though
he
never
saw
the
sun
or
knew
anything
he
is
still
better
off
than
the
former
one
6
What
is
the
benefit
of
living
a
thousand
years
twice
over
but
not
experiencing
enjoyment
Do
not
all
go
to
the
same
place
7
All
the
hard
work
of
a
man
is
to
fill
his
mouth
yet
his
appetite
is
never
satisfied
8
For
what
advantage
does
the
wise
one
have
over
the
stupid
one
or
of
what
benefit
is
it
that
the
poor
man
knows
how
to
survive
9
Better
to
enjoy
what
the
eyes
see
than
to
wander
after
ones
desires
This
too
is
futility
a
chasing
after
the
wind
10
Whatever
has
come
to
be
has
already
been
named
and
it
is
known
what
man
is
and
he
is
not
able
to
dispute
with
the
one
more
powerful
than
he
11
The
more
words
the
more
futility
and
what
advantage
do
they
bring
to
man
12
Who
knows
what
is
best
for
a
man
to
do
in
life
during
the
few
days
of
his
futile
life
which
he
spends
like
a
shadow
For
who
can
tell
man
what
will
happen
under
the
sun
after
he
is
gone
1
A
good
name
is
better
than
good
oil
and
the
day
of
death
is
better
than
the
day
of
birth
2
Better
to
go
to
the
house
of
mourning
than
to
the
house
of
feasting
for
that
is
the
end
of
every
man
and
the
living
should
take
it
to
heart
3
Better
is
distress
than
laughter
for
the
sadness
of
the
face
makes
the
heart
better
4
The
heart
of
the
wise
is
in
the
house
of
mourning
but
the
heart
of
the
stupid
is
in
the
house
of
rejoicing
5
Better
to
listen
to
a
wise
mans
rebuke
than
to
listen
to
the
song
of
fools
6
For
as
the
crackling
of
thorns
burning
under
the
pot
so
is
the
laughter
of
the
fool
and
this
too
is
futility
7
But
oppression
can
drive
the
wise
one
into
madness
and
a
bribe
corrupts
the
heart
8
Better
is
the
end
of
a
matter
than
its
beginning
Better
to
be
patient
than
to
be
haughty
in
spirit
9
Do
not
be
quick
to
take
offense
for
the
taking
of
offense
lodges
in
the
bosom
of
fools
10
Do
not
say
Why
were
the
former
days
better
than
these
for
it
is
not
out
of
wisdom
that
you
ask
this
11
Wisdom
together
with
an
inheritance
is
a
good
thing
and
an
advantage
to
those
who
see
the
light
of
day
12
For
wisdom
is
a
protection
just
as
money
is
a
protection
but
the
advantage
of
knowledge
is
this
Wisdom
preserves
the
life
of
its
owner
13
Consider
the
work
of
the
true
God
for
who
can
straighten
out
what
he
has
made
crooked
14
On
a
good
day
reflect
this
goodness
but
on
the
day
of
adversity
consider
that
God
made
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
so
that
men
cannot
be
certain
of
anything
that
will
happen
to
them
in
the
future
15
During
my
futile
life
I
have
seen
everything—from
the
righteous
one
who
perishes
in
his
righteousness
to
the
wicked
one
who
lives
long
despite
his
badness
16
Do
not
be
overly
righteous
nor
show
yourself
excessively
wise
Why
should
you
bring
ruin
to
yourself
17
Do
not
be
excessively
wicked
nor
be
foolish
Why
should
you
die
before
your
time
18
It
is
best
to
grasp
one
warning
without
letting
go
of
the
other
for
the
one
who
fears
God
will
heed
them
both
19
Wisdom
makes
a
wise
man
more
powerful
than
ten
strong
men
in
a
city
20
For
there
is
no
righteous
man
on
earth
who
always
does
good
and
never
sins
21
Also
do
not
take
to
heart
every
word
that
people
say
otherwise
you
may
hear
your
servant
calling
down
evil
on
you
22
for
you
well
know
in
your
heart
that
many
times
you
yourself
have
called
down
evil
on
others
23
All
of
this
I
tested
with
wisdom
and
I
said
I
will
become
wise
But
it
was
beyond
me
24
What
has
come
to
be
is
out
of
reach
and
exceedingly
deep
Who
can
understand
it
25
I
directed
my
heart
to
know
and
to
explore
and
to
search
for
wisdom
and
the
reason
behind
things
and
to
understand
the
wickedness
of
stupidity
and
the
folly
of
madness
26
Then
I
discovered
this
More
bitter
than
death
is
the
woman
who
is
like
a
hunters
net
whose
heart
is
like
dragnets
and
whose
hands
are
like
prison
chains
The
one
who
pleases
the
true
God
will
escape
her
but
the
sinner
is
captured
by
her
27
See
this
is
what
I
found

says
the
congregator
I
investigated
one
thing
after
another
to
reach
my
conclusion
28
but
what
I
continually
sought
I
have
not
found
One
man
out
of
a
thousand
I
found
but
a
woman
among
them
I
have
not
found
29
This
alone
I
have
found
The
true
God
made
mankind
upright
but
they
have
sought
out
many
schemes
1
Who
is
like
the
wise
man
Who
knows
the
solution
to
a
problem
A
mans
wisdom
lights
up
his
face
and
softens
his
stern
appearance
2
I
say
Obey
the
kings
orders
out
of
regard
for
the
oath
to
God
3
Do
not
rush
to
depart
from
his
presence
Do
not
take
a
stand
for
anything
bad
for
he
can
do
whatever
he
pleases
4
because
the
word
of
the
king
is
absolute
who
can
say
to
him
What
are
you
doing
5
The
one
who
observes
the
commandment
will
not
experience
harm
and
the
wise
heart
will
know
the
right
time
and
procedure
6
For
every
matter
there
is
a
time
and
procedure
because
the
troubles
of
mankind
are
so
abundant
7
Since
no
one
knows
what
will
happen
who
can
tell
him
how
it
will
happen
8
Just
as
no
man
has
power
over
the
spirit
or
can
restrain
the
spirit
so
no
one
has
power
over
the
day
of
death
Just
as
no
one
is
discharged
during
a
war
so
wickedness
will
not
allow
those
who
practice
it
to
escape
9
All
of
this
I
have
seen
and
I
applied
my
heart
to
every
work
that
has
been
done
under
the
sun
during
the
time
that
man
has
dominated
man
to
his
harm
10
And
I
saw
the
wicked
being
buried
those
who
used
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
holy
place
but
they
were
soon
forgotten
in
the
city
where
they
acted
that
way
This
too
is
futility
11
Because
sentence
against
a
bad
deed
has
not
been
executed
speedily
the
heart
of
men
becomes
emboldened
to
do
bad
12
Although
a
sinner
may
do
bad
a
hundred
times
and
still
live
a
long
time
yet
I
am
aware
that
it
will
turn
out
well
for
those
who
fear
the
true
God
because
they
fear
him
13
But
it
will
not
turn
out
well
for
the
wicked
one
nor
will
he
prolong
his
days
that
are
like
a
shadow
because
he
does
not
fear
God
14
There
is
something
futile
that
takes
place
on
the
earth
There
are
righteous
people
who
are
treated
as
if
they
had
acted
wickedly
and
there
are
wicked
people
who
are
treated
as
if
they
had
acted
righteously
I
say
that
this
too
is
futility
15
So
I
recommended
rejoicing
because
there
is
nothing
better
for
man
under
the
sun
than
to
eat
and
drink
and
rejoice
this
should
accompany
him
as
he
works
hard
during
the
days
of
his
life
which
the
true
God
gives
him
under
the
sun
16
I
applied
my
heart
to
acquire
wisdom
and
to
see
all
the
activity
happening
on
the
earth
even
going
without
sleep
day
and
night
17
Then
I
considered
all
the
work
of
the
true
God
and
I
realized
that
mankind
cannot
comprehend
what
happens
under
the
sun
No
matter
how
hard
men
try
they
cannot
comprehend
it
Even
if
they
claim
that
they
are
wise
enough
to
know
they
cannot
really
comprehend
it
1
So
I
took
all
of
this
to
heart
and
concluded
that
the
righteous
and
the
wise
as
well
as
their
works
are
in
the
hands
of
the
true
God
Men
are
not
aware
of
the
love
and
the
hate
that
took
place
prior
to
them
2
All
have
the
very
same
outcome
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
the
good
and
the
clean
and
the
unclean
those
sacrificing
and
those
not
sacrificing
The
good
one
is
the
same
as
the
sinner
the
one
who
swears
an
oath
is
the
same
as
the
one
who
is
cautious
about
swearing
an
oath
3
This
is
a
distressing
thing
that
happens
under
the
sun
Because
all
have
the
same
outcome
the
heart
of
humans
is
also
full
of
bad
and
there
is
madness
in
their
heart
during
their
life
and
then
they
die
4
There
is
hope
for
whoever
is
among
the
living
because
a
live
dog
is
better
off
than
a
dead
lion
5
For
the
living
know
that
they
will
die
but
the
dead
know
nothing
at
all
nor
do
they
have
any
more
reward
because
all
memory
of
them
is
forgotten
6
Also
their
love
and
their
hate
and
their
jealousy
have
already
perished
and
they
no
longer
have
any
share
in
what
is
done
under
the
sun
7
Go
eat
your
food
with
rejoicing
and
drink
your
wine
with
a
cheerful
heart
for
already
the
true
God
has
found
pleasure
in
your
works
8
May
your
clothing
always
be
white
and
do
not
fail
to
put
oil
on
your
head
9
Enjoy
life
with
your
beloved
wife
all
the
days
of
your
futile
life
which
He
has
given
you
under
the
sun
all
the
days
of
your
futility
for
that
is
your
lot
in
life
and
in
your
hard
work
at
which
you
toil
under
the
sun
10
Whatever
your
hand
finds
to
do
do
with
all
your
might
for
there
is
no
work
nor
planning
nor
knowledge
nor
wisdom
in
the
Grave
where
you
are
going
11
I
have
seen
something
further
under
the
sun
that
the
swift
do
not
always
win
the
race
nor
do
the
mighty
win
the
battle
nor
do
the
wise
always
have
the
food
nor
do
the
intelligent
always
have
the
riches
nor
do
those
with
knowledge
always
have
success
because
time
and
unexpected
events
overtake
them
all
12
For
man
does
not
know
his
time
Just
as
fish
are
caught
in
an
evil
net
and
birds
are
caught
in
a
trap
so
the
sons
of
men
are
ensnared
in
a
time
of
disaster
when
it
suddenly
overtakes
them
13
I
also
observed
this
about
wisdom
under
the
sun—and
it
impressed
me
14
There
was
a
small
city
with
a
few
men
in
it
and
a
mighty
king
came
against
it
and
surrounded
it
and
built
great
siegeworks
against
it
15
In
it
was
found
a
poor
but
wise
man
and
he
saved
the
city
by
his
wisdom
But
no
one
remembered
that
poor
man
16
And
I
said
to
myself
Wisdom
is
better
than
mightiness
yet
a
poor
mans
wisdom
is
despised
and
his
words
are
not
heeded
17
Better
to
heed
the
calm
words
of
the
wise
than
the
shouts
of
the
one
ruling
among
fools
18
Wisdom
is
better
than
weapons
of
war
but
just
one
sinner
can
destroy
much
good
1
As
dead
flies
cause
the
perfumers
oil
to
stink
and
bubble
so
a
little
foolishness
outweighs
wisdom
and
glory
2
The
heart
of
the
wise
one
leads
him
in
the
right
way
but
the
heart
of
the
stupid
one
leads
him
in
the
wrong
way
3
In
whatever
way
the
fool
walks
he
is
lacking
good
sense
and
he
lets
everyone
know
that
he
is
a
fool
4
If
the
anger
of
a
ruler
should
flare
up
against
you
do
not
leave
your
place
for
calmness
allays
great
sins
5
There
is
something
distressing
that
I
have
seen
under
the
sun
the
sort
of
mistake
made
by
those
in
power
6
Foolishness
is
put
in
many
high
positions
but
the
rich
remain
in
low
positions
7
I
have
seen
servants
on
horseback
but
princes
walking
on
foot
just
like
servants
8
The
one
who
digs
a
pit
may
fall
into
it
and
the
one
who
breaks
through
a
stone
wall
may
be
bitten
by
a
snake
9
The
one
who
quarries
stones
may
be
hurt
by
them
and
the
one
who
splits
logs
may
be
endangered
by
them
10
If
an
iron
tool
is
dull
and
one
does
not
sharpen
its
edge
he
will
need
to
exert
much
effort
But
wisdom
helps
to
achieve
success
11
If
the
snake
bites
before
it
is
charmed
there
is
no
advantage
to
the
skilled
charmer
12
The
words
from
the
mouth
of
the
wise
one
bring
favor
but
the
lips
of
the
stupid
one
are
his
ruin
13
The
first
words
out
of
his
mouth
are
foolishness
and
his
last
words
are
disastrous
madness
14
But
the
fool
keeps
on
speaking
A
man
does
not
know
what
will
happen
who
can
tell
him
what
will
come
after
him
15
The
hard
work
of
the
stupid
one
wears
him
out
for
he
does
not
even
know
how
to
find
his
way
to
the
city
16
How
terrible
for
a
land
when
the
king
is
a
boy
and
the
princes
start
their
feasting
in
the
morning
17
How
happy
for
the
land
when
the
king
is
the
son
of
nobles
and
the
princes
eat
at
the
proper
time
for
strength
not
for
drunkenness
18
Because
of
extreme
laziness
the
roof
beams
sag
and
because
of
idle
hands
the
house
leaks
19
Bread
is
made
for
laughter
and
wine
makes
life
enjoyable
but
money
answers
every
need
20
Even
in
your
thoughts
do
not
curse
the
king
and
do
not
curse
the
rich
in
your
bedroom
for
a
bird
may
convey
the
sound
or
a
creature
with
wings
may
repeat
what
was
said
1
Cast
your
bread
on
the
waters
for
after
many
days
you
will
find
it
again
2
Give
a
share
to
seven
or
even
to
eight
for
you
do
not
know
what
disaster
will
occur
on
the
earth
3
If
the
clouds
are
filled
with
water
they
will
pour
down
rain
on
the
earth
and
if
a
tree
falls
to
the
south
or
to
the
north
the
place
where
the
tree
falls
is
where
it
will
lie
4
The
one
who
watches
the
wind
will
not
sow
seed
and
the
one
who
looks
at
the
clouds
will
not
reap
5
Just
as
you
do
not
know
how
the
spirit
operates
in
the
bones
of
the
child
inside
a
pregnant
woman
so
you
do
not
know
the
work
of
the
true
God
who
does
all
things
6
Sow
your
seed
in
the
morning
and
do
not
let
your
hand
rest
until
the
evening
for
you
do
not
know
which
will
have
success
whether
this
one
or
that
one
or
whether
they
will
both
do
well
7
Light
is
sweet
and
it
is
good
for
the
eyes
to
see
the
sun
8
For
if
a
man
should
live
many
years
let
him
enjoy
them
all
But
he
should
remember
that
the
days
of
darkness
may
be
many
all
that
is
to
come
is
futility
9
Rejoice
young
man
while
you
are
young
and
let
your
heart
be
glad
in
the
days
of
your
youth
Follow
the
ways
of
your
heart
and
go
where
your
eyes
lead
you
but
know
that
the
true
God
will
bring
you
into
judgment
for
all
these
things
10
So
remove
troublesome
things
from
your
heart
and
ward
off
harmful
things
from
your
body
for
youth
and
the
prime
of
life
are
futility
1
Remember
then
your
Grand
Creator
in
the
days
of
your
youth
before
the
days
of
distress
come
and
the
years
arrive
when
you
will
say
I
have
no
pleasure
in
them
2
before
the
sun
and
the
light
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
grow
dark
and
the
clouds
return
after
the
downpour
3
in
the
day
when
the
guards
of
the
house
become
shaky
and
the
strong
men
stoop
over
and
the
women
quit
grinding
because
they
have
become
few
and
the
ladies
looking
out
the
windows
find
it
dark
4
when
the
doors
to
the
street
have
been
closed
when
the
sound
of
the
grinding
mill
becomes
low
when
one
gets
up
at
the
sound
of
a
bird
and
all
the
daughters
of
song
grow
faint
5
Also
one
is
afraid
of
heights
and
there
are
terrors
in
the
street
And
the
almond
tree
blossoms
and
the
grasshopper
drags
itself
along
and
the
caper
berry
bursts
because
man
is
walking
to
his
lasting
house
and
the
mourners
walk
about
in
the
street
6
before
the
silver
cord
is
removed
and
the
golden
bowl
is
crushed
and
the
jar
at
the
spring
is
broken
and
the
waterwheel
for
the
cistern
is
crushed
7
Then
the
dust
returns
to
the
earth
just
as
it
was
and
the
spirit
returns
to
the
true
God
who
gave
it
8
The
greatest
futility
says
the
congregator
Everything
is
futile
9
Not
only
had
the
congregator
become
wise
but
he
continually
taught
the
people
what
he
knew
and
he
pondered
and
made
a
thorough
search
in
order
to
compile
many
proverbs
10
The
congregator
sought
to
find
delightful
words
and
to
record
accurate
words
of
truth
11
The
words
of
the
wise
are
like
oxgoads
and
their
collected
sayings
are
like
firmly
embedded
nails
they
have
been
given
from
one
shepherd
12
As
for
anything
besides
these
my
son
be
warned
To
the
making
of
many
books
there
is
no
end
and
much
devotion
to
them
is
wearisome
to
the
flesh
13
The
conclusion
of
the
matter
everything
having
been
heard
is
Fear
the
true
God
and
keep
his
commandments
for
this
is
the
whole
obligation
of
man
14
For
the
true
God
will
judge
every
deed
including
every
hidden
thing
as
to
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
1
The
song
of
songs
which
is
Solomons

2
May
he
kiss
me
with
the
kisses
of
his
mouth
For
your
expressions
of
affection
are
better
than
wine

3
The
fragrance
of
your
oils
is
pleasant
Your
name
is
like
a
fragrant
oil
poured
out
That
is
why
the
young
women
love
you

4
Take
me
with
you
let
us
run
The
king
has
brought
me
into
his
interior
rooms
Let
us
be
joyful
and
rejoice
in
you
Let
us
praise
your
expressions
of
affection
more
than
wine
Rightly
they
love
you

5
I
am
dark
but
lovely
O
daughters
of
Jerusalem
Like
the
tents
of
Kedar
like
the
tent
cloths
of
Solomon

6
Do
not
stare
at
me
because
I
am
swarthy
Because
the
sun
has
gazed
upon
me
The
sons
of
my
mother
were
angry
with
me
They
appointed
me
the
keeper
of
the
vineyards
But
my
own
vineyard
I
did
not
keep

7
Tell
me
you
whom
I
love
so
much
Where
you
pasture
your
flock
Where
you
have
them
lie
down
at
midday
Why
should
I
be
like
a
woman
wrapped
in
a
veilAmong
the
flocks
of
your
companions

8
If
you
do
not
know
O
most
beautiful
of
women
Go
follow
the
tracks
of
the
flockAnd
pasture
your
young
goats
next
to
the
tents
of
the
shepherds

9
I
liken
you
my
beloved
to
a
mare
among
the
chariots
of
Pharaoh
10
Your
cheeks
are
lovely
with
ornaments
Your
neck
with
strings
of
beads
11
We
will
make
for
you
gold
ornamentsStudded
with
silver
12
While
the
king
sits
at
his
round
table
My
perfume
gives
off
its
fragrance
13
My
dear
one
is
to
me
like
a
fragrant
bag
of
myrrhSpending
the
night
between
my
breasts
14
My
dear
one
is
to
me
like
a
cluster
of
hennaAmong
the
vineyards
of
En-gedi
15
Look
You
are
beautiful
my
beloved
Look
You
are
beautiful
Your
eyes
are
those
of
doves
16
Look
You
are
beautiful
my
dear
one
and
delightful
Our
bed
is
among
the
foliage
17
The
beams
of
our
house
are
cedars
Our
rafters
are
juniper
trees
1
I
am
but
a
saffron
of
the
coastal
plain
A
lily
of
the
valleys

2
Like
a
lily
among
thornsIs
my
beloved
among
the
daughters

3
Like
an
apple
tree
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
So
is
my
dear
one
among
the
sons
I
passionately
desire
to
sit
in
his
shade
And
his
fruit
is
sweet
to
my
taste

4
He
brought
me
into
the
banquet
house
And
his
banner
over
me
was
love

5
Refresh
me
with
raisin
cakes
Sustain
me
with
apples
For
I
am
lovesick

6
His
left
hand
is
under
my
head
And
his
right
hand
embraces
me

7
I
put
you
under
oath
O
daughters
of
Jerusalem
By
the
gazelles
and
the
does
of
the
field
Do
not
try
to
awaken
or
arouse
love
in
me
until
it
feels
inclined

8
The
sound
of
my
dear
one
Look
Here
he
comes
Climbing
the
mountains
leaping
over
the
hills

9
My
dear
one
is
like
a
gazelle
like
a
young
stag
There
he
is
standing
behind
our
wall
Gazing
through
the
windows
Looking
through
the
lattices
10
My
dear
one
speaks
he
says
to
me
Rise
up
my
beloved
My
beautiful
one
come
away
with
me
11
Look
The
winter
has
passed
The
rains
are
over
and
gone
12
Blossoms
have
appeared
in
the
land
The
time
of
pruning
has
arrived
And
the
song
of
the
turtledove
is
heard
in
our
land
13
The
fig
tree
ripens
its
early
figs
The
vines
are
in
blossom
and
give
off
their
fragrance
Rise
up
my
beloved
and
come
My
beautiful
one
come
away
with
me
14
O
my
dove
in
the
retreats
of
the
crag
In
the
recesses
of
the
cliff
Let
me
see
you
and
hear
your
voice
For
your
voice
is
pleasant
and
your
appearance
is
lovely
15
Catch
the
foxes
for
us
The
little
foxes
that
ruin
the
vineyards
For
our
vineyards
are
in
bloom
16
My
dear
one
is
mine
and
I
am
his
He
is
shepherding
among
the
lilies
17
Until
the
day
grows
breezy
and
the
shadows
flee
Return
quickly
O
my
dear
one
Like
the
gazelle
or
the
young
stag
upon
the
mountains
of
separation
1
Upon
my
bed
during
the
nights
I
sought
the
one
I
love
I
sought
him
but
I
did
not
find
him

2
I
will
arise
and
roam
the
city
In
the
streets
and
in
the
public
squares
Let
me
seek
the
one
I
love
I
sought
him
but
I
did
not
find
him

3
The
watchmen
making
their
rounds
in
the
city
found
me
Have
you
seen
the
one
I
love

4
Scarcely
had
I
passed
by
themWhen
I
found
the
one
I
love
I
held
on
to
him
I
would
not
let
him
goUntil
I
brought
him
into
my
mothers
house
Into
the
interior
room
of
her
who
conceived
me

5
I
put
you
under
oath
O
daughters
of
Jerusalem
By
the
gazelles
and
the
does
of
the
field
Do
not
try
to
awaken
or
arouse
love
in
me
until
it
feels
inclined

6
What
is
this
coming
up
from
the
wilderness
like
columns
of
smoke
Perfumed
with
myrrh
and
frankincense
With
all
the
fragrant
powders
of
a
merchant

7
Look
It
is
the
couch
belonging
to
Solomon
Sixty
mighty
men
surround
it
Of
the
mighty
men
of
Israel
8
All
of
them
armed
with
a
sword
All
trained
in
warfare
Each
with
his
sword
at
his
sideTo
guard
against
the
terrors
of
the
night

9
It
is
the
royal
litter
of
King
SolomonThat
he
made
for
himself
from
the
trees
of
Lebanon
10
Its
pillars
he
made
of
silver
Its
supports
of
gold
Its
seat
is
of
purple
wool
Its
interior
was
lovingly
decoratedBy
the
daughters
of
Jerusalem
11
Go
out
O
daughters
of
Zion
Gaze
at
King
SolomonWearing
the
wedding
crown
his
mother
made
for
himOn
the
day
of
his
marriage
On
the
day
of
his
hearts
rejoicing
1
Look
You
are
beautiful
my
beloved
Look
You
are
beautiful
Your
eyes
are
those
of
doves
behind
your
veil
Your
hair
is
like
a
flock
of
goatsStreaming
down
the
mountains
of
Gilead

2
Your
teeth
are
like
a
flock
of
newly
shorn
sheepThat
have
come
up
from
being
washed
All
of
them
bearing
twins
And
not
one
has
lost
her
young

3
Your
lips
are
like
a
scarlet
thread
And
your
speech
is
delightful
Like
a
segment
of
pomegranateAre
your
cheeks
behind
your
veil

4
Your
neck
is
like
the
tower
of
David
Built
with
courses
of
stoneUpon
which
are
hung
a
thousand
shields
All
the
circular
shields
of
the
mighty
men

5
Your
two
breasts
are
like
two
fawns
The
twins
of
a
gazelle
That
feed
among
the
lilies

6
Until
the
day
grows
breezy
and
the
shadows
flee
I
will
go
my
way
to
the
mountain
of
myrrhAnd
to
the
hill
of
frankincense

7
You
are
altogether
beautiful
my
beloved
There
is
no
blemish
in
you

8
Come
with
me
from
Lebanon
my
bride
Come
with
me
from
Lebanon
Descend
from
the
peak
of
Amanah
From
the
peak
of
Senir
the
peak
of
Hermon
From
the
lairs
of
lions
from
the
mountains
of
leopards

9
You
have
captured
my
heart
my
sister
my
bride
You
have
captured
my
heart
with
one
glance
of
your
eyes
With
one
pendant
of
your
necklace
10
How
beautiful
your
expressions
of
affection
are
my
sister
my
bride
Your
expressions
of
affection
are
far
better
than
wine
And
the
fragrance
of
your
perfume
than
any
spice
11
Your
lips
my
bride
drip
with
comb
honey
Honey
and
milk
are
under
your
tongue
And
the
fragrance
of
your
garments
is
like
the
fragrance
of
Lebanon
12
My
sister
my
bride
is
like
a
locked
garden
A
locked
garden
a
spring
sealed
shut
13
Your
shoots
are
a
paradise
of
pomegranatesWith
the
choicest
fruits
with
henna
along
with
spikenard
plants
14
Spikenard
and
saffron
cane
and
cinnamon
With
all
sorts
of
trees
of
frankincense
myrrh
and
aloes
Along
with
all
the
finest
perfumes
15
You
are
a
garden
spring
a
well
of
fresh
water
And
flowing
streams
from
Lebanon
16
Awake
O
north
wind
Come
in
O
south
wind
Breathe
upon
my
garden
Let
its
fragrance
spread
Let
my
dear
one
come
into
his
gardenAnd
eat
its
choicest
fruits
1
I
have
entered
my
garden
O
my
sister
my
bride
I
have
picked
my
myrrh
and
my
spice
I
have
eaten
my
honeycomb
and
my
honey
I
have
drunk
my
wine
and
my
milk
Eat
dear
friends
Drink
and
become
intoxicated
with
expressions
of
affection

2
I
am
asleep
but
my
heart
is
awake
There
is
the
sound
of
my
dear
one
knocking
Open
to
me
O
my
sister
my
beloved
My
dove
my
flawless
one
For
my
head
is
wet
with
dew
The
locks
of
my
hair
with
the
moisture
of
the
night

3
I
have
taken
off
my
robe
Must
I
put
it
back
on
I
have
washed
my
feet
Must
I
soil
them
again

4
My
dear
one
withdrew
his
hand
from
the
hole
of
the
door
And
my
feelings
for
him
were
stirred

5
I
got
up
to
open
to
my
dear
one
My
hands
dripped
with
myrrh
And
my
fingers
with
liquid
myrrh
Onto
the
handles
of
the
lock

6
I
opened
to
my
dear
one
But
my
dear
one
had
turned
away
he
had
gone
I
felt
despair
when
he
departed
I
sought
him
but
I
did
not
find
him
I
called
him
but
he
did
not
answer
me

7
The
watchmen
making
their
rounds
in
the
city
found
me
They
struck
me
they
wounded
me
The
watchmen
of
the
walls
took
my
shawl
away
from
me

8
I
put
you
under
oath
O
daughters
of
Jerusalem
If
you
find
my
dear
one
Tell
him
that
I
am
lovesick

9
How
is
your
dear
one
better
than
any
other
dear
one
You
most
beautiful
of
women
How
is
your
dear
one
better
than
any
other
dear
one
That
you
put
us
under
such
an
oath
10
My
dear
one
is
dazzling
and
ruddy
He
stands
out
among
ten
thousand
11
His
head
is
gold
the
finest
gold
The
locks
of
his
hair
are
like
waving
palm
fronds
As
black
as
the
raven
12
His
eyes
are
like
doves
by
streams
of
water
Bathing
themselves
in
milk
Sitting
by
a
brimming
pool
13
His
cheeks
are
like
a
bed
of
spices
Mounds
of
scented
herbs
His
lips
are
lilies
dripping
with
liquid
myrrh
14
His
hands
are
cylinders
of
gold
set
with
chrysolite
His
abdomen
is
polished
ivory
covered
with
sapphires
15
His
legs
are
pillars
of
marble
set
on
pedestals
of
the
finest
gold
His
appearance
is
like
Lebanon
as
unrivaled
as
the
cedars
16
His
mouth
is
sweetness
itself
And
everything
about
him
is
desirable
This
is
my
dear
one
this
is
my
beloved
O
daughters
of
Jerusalem
1
Where
has
your
dear
one
gone
O
most
beautiful
of
women
Which
way
did
your
dear
one
turn
Let
us
seek
him
with
you

2
My
dear
one
has
gone
down
to
his
garden
To
the
beds
of
spice
plants
To
shepherd
among
the
gardensAnd
to
pick
lilies

3
I
am
my
dear
ones
And
my
dear
one
is
mine
He
is
shepherding
among
the
lilies

4
You
are
as
beautiful
as
Tirzah
my
beloved
As
lovely
as
Jerusalem
As
breathtaking
as
armies
around
their
banners

5
Turn
your
eyes
away
from
me
For
they
overwhelm
me
Your
hair
is
like
a
flock
of
goatsStreaming
down
the
slopes
of
Gilead

6
Your
teeth
are
like
a
flock
of
sheepThat
have
come
up
from
being
washed
All
of
them
bearing
twins
And
not
one
has
lost
her
young

7
Like
a
segment
of
pomegranateAre
your
cheeks
behind
your
veil

8
There
may
be
60
queensAnd
80
concubinesAnd
young
women
without
number

9
But
only
one
is
my
dove
my
flawless
one
The
only
one
of
her
mother
She
is
the
favorite
of
the
one
who
bore
her
The
daughters
see
her
and
they
pronounce
her
happy
Queens
and
concubines
and
they
praise
her
10
Who
is
she
who
shines
like
the
dawn
As
beautiful
as
the
full
moon
As
pure
as
the
sunlight
As
breathtaking
as
armies
around
their
banners
11
I
went
down
to
the
garden
of
nut
treesTo
see
the
new
growth
in
the
valley
To
see
whether
the
vine
had
sprouted
Whether
the
pomegranate
trees
had
blossomed
12
Before
I
knew
it
My
desire
had
put
meAt
the
chariots
of
my
noble
people
13
Return
return
O
Shulammite
Return
return
That
we
may
look
upon
you
Why
do
you
gaze
upon
the
Shulammite
She
is
like
the
dance
of
two
companies
1
How
beautiful
your
feet
are
in
your
sandals
O
noble
daughter
The
curves
of
your
thighs
are
like
ornaments
The
work
of
an
artisans
hands

2
Your
navel
is
a
round
bowl
May
it
never
lack
mixed
wine
Your
belly
is
a
heap
of
wheat
Encircled
by
lilies

3
Your
two
breasts
are
like
two
fawns
The
twins
of
a
gazelle

4
Your
neck
is
like
an
ivory
tower
Your
eyes
are
like
the
pools
in
Heshbon
By
the
gate
of
Bath-rabbim
Your
nose
is
like
the
tower
of
Lebanon
Which
looks
toward
Damascus

5
Your
head
crowns
you
like
Carmel
And
the
locks
of
your
hair
are
like
purple
wool
The
king
is
captivated
by
the
flowing
tresses

6
How
beautiful
you
are
and
how
pleasant
you
are
O
beloved
girl
above
all
exquisite
delights

7
Your
stature
is
like
a
palm
tree
And
your
breasts
are
like
date
clusters

8
I
said
I
will
climb
the
palm
treeTo
take
hold
of
its
stalks
of
fruit
May
your
breasts
be
like
clusters
of
grapes
Your
breath
as
fragrant
as
apples
9
And
your
mouth
like
the
best
wine
May
it
go
down
smoothly
for
my
dear
one
Softly
flowing
over
the
lips
of
those
asleep
10
I
am
my
dear
ones
And
his
desire
is
for
me
11
Come
O
my
dear
one
Let
us
go
out
to
the
fields
Let
us
lodge
among
the
henna
plants
12
Let
us
rise
early
and
go
to
the
vineyardsTo
see
if
the
vine
has
sprouted
If
the
blossoms
have
opened
If
the
pomegranates
are
in
bloom
There
I
will
express
my
affection
for
you
13
The
mandrakes
give
off
their
fragrance
At
our
doors
are
all
sorts
of
choice
fruits
The
new
as
well
as
the
old
O
my
dear
one
I
have
kept
in
store
for
you
1
If
only
you
were
like
my
brother
Who
nursed
at
my
mothers
breasts
Then
if
I
found
you
outside
I
would
kiss
you
And
no
one
would
despise
me

2
I
would
lead
you
I
would
bring
you
into
the
house
of
my
mother
She
who
taught
me
I
would
give
you
spiced
wine
to
drink
The
fresh
juice
of
pomegranates

3
His
left
hand
would
be
under
my
head
And
his
right
hand
would
embrace
me

4
I
put
you
under
oath
O
daughters
of
Jerusalem
Do
not
try
to
awaken
or
arouse
love
in
me
until
it
feels
inclined

5
Who
is
this
coming
up
from
the
wilderness
Leaning
upon
her
dear
one
Under
the
apple
tree
I
awakened
you
There
your
mother
was
in
labor
with
you
There
she
who
gave
birth
to
you
was
in
labor

6
Place
me
as
a
seal
upon
your
heart
As
a
seal
upon
your
arm
For
love
is
as
strong
as
death
is
And
exclusive
devotion
is
as
unyielding
as
the
Grave
Its
flames
are
a
blazing
fire
the
flame
of
Jah

7
Surging
waters
cannot
extinguish
love
Nor
can
rivers
wash
it
away
If
a
man
would
offer
all
the
wealth
of
his
house
for
love
It
would
be
utterly
despised

8
We
have
a
little
sister
And
she
has
no
breasts
What
will
we
do
for
our
sisterOn
the
day
when
she
is
spoken
for

9
If
she
is
a
wall
We
will
build
upon
her
a
battlement
of
silver
But
if
she
is
a
door
We
will
board
her
up
with
a
cedar
plank
10
I
am
a
wall
And
my
breasts
are
like
towers
So
in
his
eyes
I
have
becomeAs
one
who
finds
peace
11
Solomon
had
a
vineyard
in
Baal-hamon
He
entrusted
the
vineyard
to
caretakers
Each
one
would
bring
in
a
thousand
pieces
of
silver
for
its
fruit
12
I
have
my
own
vineyard
at
my
disposal
The
thousand
pieces
of
silver
belong
to
you
O
Solomon
And
two
hundred
to
those
who
care
for
its
fruit
13
O
you
who
are
dwelling
in
the
gardens
The
companions
listen
for
your
voice
Let
me
hear
it
14
Hurry
my
dear
one
And
be
swift
like
a
gazelleOr
a
young
stagUpon
the
mountains
of
spices
1
The
vision
that
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
saw
concerning
Judah
and
Jerusalem
in
the
days
of
Uzziah
Jotham
Ahaz
and
Hezekiah
kings
of
Judah

2
Hear
O
heavens
and
pay
attention
O
earth
For
Jehovah
has
spoken
Sons
I
have
brought
up
and
raised
But
they
have
revolted
against
me

3
A
bull
well
knows
its
buyer
And
a
donkey
the
manger
of
its
owner
But
Israel
does
not
know
me
My
own
people
do
not
behave
with
understanding

4
Woe
to
the
sinful
nation
The
people
weighed
down
with
error
A
brood
of
wicked
men
corrupt
children
They
have
abandoned
Jehovah
They
have
treated
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
with
disrespect
They
have
turned
their
backs
on
him

5
Where
will
you
be
struck
next
as
you
add
to
your
rebellion
The
whole
head
is
sick
And
the
whole
heart
is
diseased

6
From
the
sole
of
the
foot
to
the
head
nothing
is
healthy
There
are
wounds
and
bruises
and
open
sores—They
have
not
been
treated
or
bound
up
or
softened
with
oil

7
Your
land
is
desolate
Your
cities
are
burned
with
fire
Foreigners
devour
your
land
right
in
front
of
you
It
is
like
a
wasteland
overthrown
by
foreigners

8
The
daughter
of
Zion
has
been
left
like
a
shelter
in
a
vineyard
Like
a
hut
in
a
cucumber
field
Like
a
city
under
siege

9
Unless
Jehovah
of
armies
had
left
us
a
few
survivors
We
should
have
become
just
like
Sodom
And
we
should
have
resembled
Gomorrah
10
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
you
dictators
of
Sodom
Pay
attention
to
the
law
of
our
God
you
people
of
Gomorrah
11
Of
what
benefit
to
me
are
your
many
sacrifices
says
Jehovah
I
have
had
enough
of
your
burnt
offerings
of
rams
and
the
fat
of
well-fed
animals
And
I
have
no
delight
in
the
blood
of
young
bulls
and
lambs
and
goats
12
When
you
come
to
appear
before
me
Who
has
required
this
from
you
This
trampling
of
my
courtyards
13
Stop
bringing
in
any
more
worthless
grain
offerings
Your
incense
is
detestable
to
me
New
moons
sabbaths
the
calling
of
conventions—I
cannot
put
up
with
the
use
of
magical
power
along
with
your
solemn
assembly
14
I
have
hated
your
new
moons
and
your
festivals
They
have
become
a
burden
to
me
I
am
tired
of
bearing
them
15
And
when
you
spread
out
your
palms
I
hide
my
eyes
from
you
Although
you
offer
many
prayers
I
am
not
listening
Your
hands
are
filled
with
blood
16
Wash
yourselves
make
yourselves
clean
Remove
your
evil
deeds
from
my
sight
Stop
doing
bad
17
Learn
to
do
good
seek
justice
Correct
the
oppressor
Defend
the
rights
of
the
fatherless
child
And
plead
the
cause
of
the
widow
18
Come
now
and
let
us
set
matters
straight
between
us

says
Jehovah
Though
your
sins
are
like
scarlet
They
will
be
made
as
white
as
snow
Though
they
are
as
red
as
crimson
cloth
They
will
become
like
wool
19
If
you
show
willingness
and
listen
You
will
eat
the
good
things
of
the
land
20
But
if
you
refuse
and
rebel
You
will
be
devoured
by
the
sword
For
the
mouth
of
Jehovah
has
spoken
it
21
How
the
faithful
city
has
become
a
prostitute
She
was
full
of
justice
Righteousness
used
to
lodge
in
her
But
now
murderers
22
Your
silver
has
become
dross
And
your
beer
is
diluted
with
water
23
Your
princes
are
stubborn
and
partners
with
thieves
Every
one
of
them
loves
a
bribe
and
chases
after
gifts
They
do
not
grant
justice
to
the
fatherless
And
the
legal
case
of
the
widow
never
reaches
them
24
Therefore
the
true
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
The
Powerful
One
of
Israel
declares
Ah
I
will
rid
myself
of
my
adversaries
And
I
will
take
revenge
on
my
enemies
25
I
will
turn
my
hand
against
you
I
will
smelt
away
your
dross
as
with
lye
And
I
will
remove
all
your
impurities
26
I
will
restore
your
judges
as
in
the
beginningAnd
your
advisers
as
at
the
start
After
this
you
will
be
called
City
of
Righteousness
Faithful
Town
27
With
justice
Zion
will
be
redeemed
And
her
people
who
return
with
righteousness
28
The
rebels
and
the
sinners
will
be
broken
together
And
those
leaving
Jehovah
will
come
to
their
finish
29
For
they
will
be
ashamed
of
the
mighty
trees
that
you
desired
And
you
will
be
disgraced
because
of
the
gardens
that
you
chose
30
For
you
will
become
like
a
big
tree
with
withering
leaves
And
like
a
garden
without
water
31
The
strong
man
will
become
tow
And
his
work
a
spark
Both
of
them
will
go
up
in
flames
together
With
no
one
to
extinguish
them
1
This
is
what
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
saw
concerning
Judah
and
Jerusalem

2
In
the
final
part
of
the
days
The
mountain
of
the
house
of
JehovahWill
become
firmly
established
above
the
top
of
the
mountains
And
it
will
be
raised
up
above
the
hills
And
to
it
all
the
nations
will
stream

3
And
many
peoples
will
go
and
say
Come
let
us
go
up
to
the
mountain
of
Jehovah
To
the
house
of
the
God
of
Jacob
He
will
instruct
us
about
his
ways
And
we
will
walk
in
his
paths
For
law
will
go
out
of
Zion
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
out
of
Jerusalem

4
He
will
render
judgment
among
the
nationsAnd
set
matters
straight
respecting
many
peoples
They
will
beat
their
swords
into
plowsharesAnd
their
spears
into
pruning
shears
Nation
will
not
lift
up
sword
against
nation
Nor
will
they
learn
war
anymore

5
O
house
of
Jacob
come
Let
us
walk
in
the
light
of
Jehovah

6
For
you
have
forsaken
your
people
the
house
of
Jacob
Because
they
have
become
full
of
things
from
the
East
They
practice
magic
like
the
Philistines
And
they
abound
with
the
children
of
foreigners

7
Their
land
is
filled
with
silver
and
gold
And
there
is
no
limit
to
their
treasures
Their
land
is
filled
with
horses
And
there
is
no
limit
to
their
chariots

8
Their
land
is
filled
with
worthless
gods
They
bow
down
to
the
work
of
their
own
hands
To
what
their
own
fingers
have
made

9
So
man
bows
down
he
becomes
low
And
you
cannot
possibly
pardon
them
10
Enter
into
the
rock
and
hide
yourself
in
the
dustBecause
of
the
terrifying
presence
of
JehovahAnd
his
majestic
splendor
11
The
haughty
eyes
of
man
will
be
brought
low
And
the
arrogance
of
men
will
bow
down
Jehovah
alone
will
be
exalted
in
that
day
12
For
it
is
the
day
belonging
to
Jehovah
of
armies
It
is
coming
upon
everyone
who
is
haughty
and
lofty
Upon
everyone
whether
exalted
or
lowly
13
Upon
all
the
cedars
of
Lebanon
that
are
lofty
and
exaltedAnd
upon
all
the
oaks
of
Bashan
14
Upon
all
the
lofty
mountainsAnd
upon
all
the
high
hills
15
Upon
every
high
tower
and
every
fortified
wall
16
Upon
all
the
ships
of
TarshishAnd
upon
all
desirable
boats
17
Mans
haughtiness
will
be
brought
down
And
the
arrogance
of
men
will
bow
low
Jehovah
alone
will
be
exalted
in
that
day
18
The
worthless
gods
will
completely
disappear
19
And
people
will
enter
into
the
caves
of
the
rocksAnd
into
the
holes
in
the
ground
Because
of
the
terrifying
presence
of
JehovahAnd
his
majestic
splendor
When
he
arises
to
make
the
earth
tremble
in
terror
20
In
that
day
men
will
take
their
worthless
gods
of
silver
and
of
goldThat
they
had
made
for
themselves
to
bow
down
toAnd
throw
them
away
to
the
shrewmice
and
to
the
bats
21
In
order
to
enter
into
the
holes
in
the
rocksAnd
into
the
clefts
of
the
crags
Because
of
the
terrifying
presence
of
JehovahAnd
his
majestic
splendor
When
he
arises
to
make
the
earth
tremble
in
terror
22
For
your
own
sakes
quit
trusting
in
mere
man
Who
is
only
the
breath
in
his
nostrils
Why
should
he
be
taken
into
account
1
For
look
the
true
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
Is
removing
from
Jerusalem
and
Judah
every
kind
of
support
and
supply
All
support
of
bread
and
water
2
Mighty
man
and
warrior
Judge
and
prophet
diviner
and
elder
3
Chief
of
50
dignitary
and
adviser
The
expert
magician
and
the
skilled
charmer

4
I
will
make
boys
their
princes
And
the
unstable
will
rule
over
them

5
The
people
will
oppress
one
another
Each
one
his
fellow
man
The
boy
will
assault
the
old
man
And
the
lightly
esteemed
one
will
defy
the
respected
one

6
Each
one
will
take
hold
of
his
brother
in
his
fathers
house
and
say
You
have
a
cloak—you
be
our
commander
Take
charge
of
this
overthrown
pile
of
ruins

7
But
he
will
protest
in
that
day
I
will
not
be
your
wound
dresser
I
have
no
food
or
clothing
in
my
house
Do
not
make
me
commander
over
the
people

8
For
Jerusalem
has
stumbled
And
Judah
has
fallen
Because
in
word
and
deed
they
are
against
Jehovah
They
behave
defiantly
in
his
glorious
presence

9
The
expression
of
their
faces
testifies
against
them
And
they
proclaim
their
sin
like
Sodom
They
do
not
try
to
hide
it
Woe
to
them
for
they
are
bringing
disaster
on
themselves
10
Tell
the
righteous
that
it
will
go
well
for
them
They
will
be
rewarded
for
what
they
do
11
Woe
to
the
wicked
one
Disaster
will
befall
him
For
what
his
hands
have
done
will
be
done
to
him
12
As
for
my
people
their
taskmasters
are
abusive
And
women
rule
over
them
My
people
your
leaders
are
causing
you
to
wander
And
they
confuse
the
direction
of
your
paths
13
Jehovah
is
taking
his
position
to
accuse
He
is
standing
up
to
pass
sentence
on
peoples
14
Jehovah
will
enter
into
judgment
with
the
elders
and
princes
of
his
people
You
have
burned
down
the
vineyard
And
what
you
have
stolen
from
the
poor
is
in
your
houses
15
How
dare
you
crush
my
peopleAnd
grind
the
faces
of
the
poor
in
the
dirt
declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
16
Jehovah
says
Because
the
daughters
of
Zion
are
haughty
Walking
with
their
heads
high
Flirting
with
their
eyes
skipping
along
Making
a
tinkling
sound
with
their
anklets
17
Jehovah
will
also
strike
the
head
of
the
daughters
of
Zion
with
scabs
And
Jehovah
will
make
their
forehead
bare
18
In
that
day
Jehovah
will
take
away
the
beauty
of
their
bangles
The
headbands
and
the
crescent-shaped
ornaments
19
The
earrings
the
bracelets
and
the
veils
20
The
headdresses
the
ankle
chains
and
the
breastbands
The
perfume
receptacles
and
the
charms
21
The
finger
rings
and
the
nose
rings
22
The
ceremonial
robes
the
overtunics
the
cloaks
and
the
purses
23
The
hand
mirrors
and
the
linen
garments
The
turbans
and
the
veils
24
Instead
of
balsam
oil
there
will
be
a
rotten
smell
Instead
of
a
belt
a
rope
Instead
of
a
beautiful
hairstyle
baldness
Instead
of
a
rich
garment
a
garment
of
sackcloth
And
a
brand
mark
instead
of
beauty
25
By
the
sword
your
men
will
fall
And
your
mighty
men
in
battle
26
Her
entrances
will
mourn
and
grieve
And
she
will
sit
on
the
ground
desolate
1
And
seven
women
will
grab
hold
of
one
man
in
that
day
saying
We
will
eat
our
own
breadAnd
wear
our
own
clothing
Only
let
us
be
called
by
your
nameTo
take
away
our
disgrace
2
In
that
day
what
Jehovah
makes
sprout
will
be
splendid
and
glorious
and
the
fruitage
of
the
land
will
be
the
pride
and
beauty
of
the
survivors
of
Israel
3
Whoever
remains
in
Zion
and
is
left
over
in
Jerusalem
will
be
called
holy
all
of
those
in
Jerusalem
written
down
for
life
4
When
Jehovah
washes
away
the
filth
of
the
daughters
of
Zion
and
rinses
away
the
bloodshed
of
Jerusalem
from
her
midst
by
the
spirit
of
judgment
and
by
a
spirit
of
burning
5
Jehovah
will
also
create
over
the
whole
site
of
Mount
Zion
and
over
the
place
of
her
conventions
a
cloud
and
smoke
by
day
and
a
bright
flaming
fire
by
night
for
over
all
the
glory
there
will
be
a
shelter
6
And
there
will
be
a
booth
for
shade
by
day
from
the
heat
and
for
refuge
and
protection
from
storms
and
the
rain
1
Let
me
sing
please
to
my
belovedA
song
about
my
loved
one
and
his
vineyard
My
beloved
had
a
vineyard
on
a
fruitful
hillside

2
He
dug
it
up
and
rid
it
of
stones
He
planted
it
with
a
choice
red
vine
Built
a
tower
in
the
middle
of
it
And
hewed
out
a
winepress
in
it
Then
he
kept
hoping
for
it
to
produce
grapes
But
it
produced
only
wild
grapes

3
And
now
you
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
and
men
of
Judah
Please
judge
between
me
and
my
vineyard

4
What
more
could
I
have
done
for
my
vineyardThat
I
have
not
already
done
Why
when
I
hoped
for
grapes
Did
it
produce
only
wild
grapes

5
Now
please
let
me
tell
youWhat
I
will
do
to
my
vineyard
I
will
remove
its
hedge
And
it
will
be
burned
down
I
will
break
down
its
stone
wall
And
it
will
be
trampled
on

6
I
will
make
it
a
wasteland
It
will
not
be
pruned
or
hoed
It
will
be
overgrown
with
thornbushes
and
weeds
And
I
will
command
the
clouds
not
to
send
any
rain
on
it

7
For
the
vineyard
of
Jehovah
of
armies
is
the
house
of
Israel
The
men
of
Judah
are
the
plantation
he
was
fond
of
He
kept
hoping
for
justice
But
look
there
was
injustice
For
righteousness
But
look
a
cry
of
distress

8
Woe
to
those
who
join
one
house
to
another
houseAnd
who
annex
one
field
to
another
fieldUntil
there
is
no
more
roomAnd
you
live
by
yourselves
on
the
land

9
Jehovah
of
armies
has
sworn
in
my
earsThat
many
houses
though
great
and
beautiful
Will
become
an
object
of
horror
Without
an
inhabitant
10
For
ten
acres
of
vineyard
will
produce
but
one
bath
measure
And
a
homer
measure
of
seed
will
produce
only
an
ephah
11
Woe
to
those
who
get
up
early
in
the
morning
to
drink
alcohol
Who
linger
late
into
the
evening
darkness
until
wine
inflames
them
12
They
have
harp
and
stringed
instrument
Tambourine
flute
and
wine
at
their
feasts
But
they
do
not
consider
the
activity
of
Jehovah
And
they
do
not
see
the
work
of
his
hands
13
So
my
people
will
go
into
exileFor
lack
of
knowledge
Their
glorious
men
will
go
hungry
And
all
their
people
will
be
parched
with
thirst
14
So
the
Grave
has
enlarged
itselfAnd
has
opened
its
mouth
wide
without
limit
And
her
splendor
her
noisy
multitudes
and
her
revelersWill
certainly
go
down
into
it
15
And
man
will
bow
down
Man
will
be
brought
low
And
the
eyes
of
the
haughty
will
be
brought
low
16
Jehovah
of
armies
will
be
exalted
by
his
judgment
The
true
God
the
Holy
One
will
sanctify
himself
through
righteousness
17
And
the
lambs
will
graze
as
in
their
pasture
Foreign
residents
will
feed
on
the
desolate
places
of
well-fed
animals
18
Woe
to
those
who
drag
along
their
guilt
with
ropes
of
deceptionAnd
their
sin
with
wagon
cords
19
Those
who
say
Let
Him
speed
up
his
work
Let
it
come
quickly
that
we
may
see
it
Let
the
purpose
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
take
placeThat
we
may
know
it
20
Woe
to
those
who
say
that
good
is
bad
and
bad
is
good
Those
who
substitute
darkness
for
light
and
light
for
darkness
Those
who
put
bitter
for
sweet
and
sweet
for
bitter
21
Woe
to
those
wise
in
their
own
eyesAnd
discreet
in
their
own
sight
22
Woe
to
those
who
are
mighty
in
drinking
wineAnd
to
the
men
who
are
masters
at
mixing
alcoholic
drinks
23
Those
who
acquit
the
wicked
for
a
bribeAnd
who
deny
justice
to
the
righteous
24
Therefore
just
as
the
tongue
of
fire
consumes
the
stubbleAnd
dry
grass
shrivels
in
the
flames
Their
very
roots
will
rot
And
their
blossoms
will
scatter
like
powder
Because
they
rejected
the
law
of
Jehovah
of
armiesAnd
disrespected
the
word
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
25
That
is
why
the
anger
of
Jehovah
burns
against
his
people
And
he
will
stretch
out
his
hand
against
them
and
strike
them
The
mountains
will
quake
And
their
corpses
will
be
like
refuse
in
the
streets
In
view
of
all
this
his
anger
has
not
turned
back
But
his
hand
is
still
stretched
out
to
strike
26
He
has
raised
up
a
signal
to
a
distant
nation
He
has
whistled
for
them
to
come
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
And
look
they
are
coming
very
swiftly
27
None
among
them
are
tired
or
stumbling
No
one
is
drowsy
or
sleeps
The
belt
around
their
waist
is
not
loosened
Nor
are
their
sandal
laces
broken
28
All
their
arrows
are
sharp
And
all
their
bows
are
bent
The
hooves
of
their
horses
are
like
flint
And
their
wheels
like
a
storm
wind
29
Their
roaring
is
like
that
of
a
lion
They
roar
like
young
lions
They
will
growl
and
seize
the
preyAnd
carry
it
off
with
no
one
to
rescue
it
30
In
that
day
they
will
growl
over
itLike
the
growling
of
the
sea
Anyone
who
gazes
at
the
land
will
see
distressing
darkness
Even
the
light
has
grown
dark
because
of
the
clouds
1
In
the
year
that
King
Uzziah
died
I
saw
Jehovah
sitting
on
a
lofty
and
elevated
throne
and
the
skirts
of
his
robe
filled
the
temple
2
Seraphs
were
standing
above
him
each
had
six
wings
Each
covered
his
face
with
two
and
covered
his
feet
with
two
and
each
of
them
would
fly
about
with
two

3
And
one
called
to
the
other
Holy
holy
holy
is
Jehovah
of
armies
The
whole
earth
is
filled
with
his
glory
4
And
the
pivots
of
the
thresholds
quivered
at
the
sound
of
the
shouting
and
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke

5
Then
I
said
Woe
to
me
I
am
as
good
as
dead
For
I
am
a
man
of
unclean
lips
And
I
live
among
a
people
of
unclean
lips
For
my
eyes
have
seen
the
King
Jehovah
of
armies
himself
6
At
that
one
of
the
seraphs
flew
to
me
and
in
his
hand
was
a
glowing
coal
that
he
had
taken
with
tongs
from
the
altar
7
He
touched
my
mouth
and
said
Look
This
has
touched
your
lips
Your
guilt
is
removed
And
your
sin
is
atoned
for
8
Then
I
heard
the
voice
of
Jehovah
saying
Whom
shall
I
send
and
who
will
go
for
us
And
I
said
Here
I
am
Send
me

9
And
he
replied
Go
and
say
to
this
people
You
will
hear
again
and
again
But
you
will
not
understand
You
will
see
again
and
again
But
you
will
not
get
any
knowledge
10
Make
the
heart
of
this
people
unreceptive
Make
their
ears
unresponsive
And
paste
their
eyes
together
So
that
they
may
not
see
with
their
eyesAnd
hear
with
their
ears
So
that
their
heart
may
not
understandAnd
they
may
not
turn
back
and
be
healed
11
At
this
I
said
How
long
O
Jehovah
Then
he
said
Until
the
cities
crash
in
ruins
without
an
inhabitantAnd
the
houses
are
without
peopleAnd
the
land
is
ruined
and
desolate
12
Until
Jehovah
removes
men
far
awayAnd
the
deserted
condition
of
the
land
becomes
very
extensive
13
But
there
will
still
be
a
tenth
in
it
and
it
will
again
be
burned
like
a
big
tree
and
like
an
oak
which
after
they
are
cut
down
leave
a
stump
a
holy
seed
will
be
its
stump
1
Now
in
the
days
of
Ahaz
son
of
Jotham
son
of
Uzziah
the
king
of
Judah
King
Rezin
of
Syria
and
Pekah
son
of
Remaliah
the
king
of
Israel
came
up
to
wage
war
against
Jerusalem
but
he
could
not
capture
it
2
A
report
was
made
to
the
house
of
David
Syria
has
joined
forces
with
Ephraim
And
the
heart
of
Ahaz
and
the
heart
of
his
people
began
to
tremble
like
the
trees
of
the
forest
shaking
in
the
wind
3
Jehovah
then
said
to
Isaiah
Go
out
please
to
meet
Ahaz
you
and
your
son
Shear-jashub
at
the
end
of
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
by
the
highway
of
the
laundrymans
field
4
You
must
say
to
him
Take
care
to
stay
calm
Do
not
be
afraid
and
do
not
lose
heart
because
of
these
two
stumps
of
smoldering
logs
because
of
the
hot
anger
of
Rezin
and
Syria
and
the
son
of
Remaliah
5
For
Syria
with
Ephraim
and
the
son
of
Remaliah
have
plotted
harm
against
you
saying
6
Let
us
go
up
against
Judah
and
tear
it
apart
and
conquer
it
for
ourselves
and
let
us
appoint
the
son
of
Tabeel
as
its
king

7
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
It
will
not
succeed
Nor
will
it
take
place

8
For
the
head
of
Syria
is
Damascus
And
the
head
of
Damascus
is
Rezin
Within
just
65
yearsEphraim
will
be
completely
shattered
and
cease
to
be
a
people

9
The
head
of
Ephraim
is
Samaria
And
the
head
of
Samaria
is
the
son
of
Remaliah
Unless
you
have
firm
faith
You
will
not
be
firmly
established
10
Jehovah
continued
speaking
to
Ahaz
11
Ask
for
a
sign
from
Jehovah
your
God
it
may
be
as
deep
as
the
Grave
or
as
high
as
the
sky
12
But
Ahaz
said
I
will
not
ask
nor
will
I
put
Jehovah
to
the
test
13
Isaiah
then
said
Listen
please
O
house
of
David
Is
it
not
enough
that
you
try
the
patience
of
men
Must
you
also
try
the
patience
of
God
14
Therefore
Jehovah
himself
will
give
you
a
sign
Look
The
young
woman
will
become
pregnant
and
will
give
birth
to
a
son
and
she
will
name
him
Immanuel
15
He
will
eat
butter
and
honey
by
the
time
that
he
knows
how
to
reject
the
bad
and
choose
the
good
16
For
before
the
boy
knows
how
to
reject
the
bad
and
choose
the
good
the
land
of
the
two
kings
whom
you
dread
will
be
completely
abandoned
17
Jehovah
will
bring
against
you
and
against
your
people
and
against
the
house
of
your
father
a
time
such
as
has
not
come
since
the
day
Ephraim
broke
away
from
Judah
for
He
will
bring
the
king
of
Assyria
18
In
that
day
Jehovah
will
whistle
for
the
flies
from
the
distant
streams
of
the
Nile
of
Egypt
and
for
the
bees
in
the
land
of
Assyria
19
and
they
will
all
come
and
settle
down
on
the
steep
valleys
on
the
rocky
clefts
on
all
the
thornbushes
and
on
all
the
watering
places
20
In
that
day
by
means
of
a
hired
razor
from
the
region
of
the
River
by
means
of
the
king
of
Assyria
Jehovah
will
shave
the
head
and
the
hair
of
the
legs
and
it
will
sweep
away
the
beard
as
well
21
In
that
day
a
man
will
keep
alive
a
young
cow
of
the
herd
and
two
sheep
22
And
because
of
the
abundance
of
milk
he
will
eat
butter
for
everyone
remaining
in
the
land
will
eat
butter
and
honey
23
In
that
day
wherever
there
used
to
be
1000
vines
worth
1000
pieces
of
silver
there
will
be
only
thornbushes
and
weeds
24
Men
will
go
there
with
bow
and
arrow
because
all
the
land
will
become
thornbushes
and
weeds
25
And
all
the
mountains
that
used
to
be
cleared
with
a
hoe
you
will
not
go
near
for
fear
of
thornbushes
and
weeds
they
will
become
a
grazing
place
for
bulls
and
a
trampling
ground
of
sheep
1
Jehovah
said
to
me
Take
a
large
tablet
and
write
on
it
with
an
ordinary
stylus
Maher-shalal-hash-baz
2
And
let
me
have
it
confirmed
in
writing
by
faithful
witnesses
Uriah
the
priest
and
Zechariah
the
son
of
Jeberechiah
3
Then
I
had
relations
with
the
prophetess
and
she
became
pregnant
and
in
time
gave
birth
to
a
son
Jehovah
then
said
to
me
Name
him
Maher-shalal-hash-baz
4
for
before
the
boy
knows
how
to
call
out
My
father
and
My
mother
the
resources
of
Damascus
and
the
spoil
of
Samaria
will
be
carried
away
before
the
king
of
Assyria
5
Jehovah
spoke
to
me
again

6
Because
this
people
has
rejected
the
gently
flowing
waters
of
the
ShiloahAnd
they
rejoice
over
Rezin
and
the
son
of
Remaliah
7
Therefore
look
Jehovah
will
bring
against
themThe
mighty
and
vast
waters
of
the
River
The
king
of
Assyria
and
all
his
glory
He
will
come
up
over
all
his
streambedsAnd
overflow
all
his
banks
8
And
sweep
through
Judah
He
will
flood
and
pass
through
reaching
to
the
neck
His
outspread
wings
will
fill
the
breadth
of
your
land
O
Immanuel

9
Cause
harm
you
peoples
but
you
will
be
shattered
to
pieces
Listen
all
you
from
distant
parts
of
the
earth
Prepare
for
battle
but
you
will
be
shattered
to
pieces
Prepare
for
battle
but
you
will
be
shattered
to
pieces
10
Devise
a
plan
but
it
will
be
thwarted
Say
what
you
like
but
it
will
not
succeed
For
God
is
with
us
11
With
his
strong
hand
on
me
this
is
what
Jehovah
said
to
me
to
warn
me
away
from
following
the
course
of
this
people
12
You
should
not
call
a
conspiracy
what
this
people
calls
a
conspiracy
Do
not
fear
what
they
fear
Do
not
tremble
at
it
13
Jehovah
of
armies—he
is
the
One
you
should
regard
as
holy
He
is
the
One
you
should
fear
And
he
is
the
One
who
should
cause
you
to
tremble
14
He
will
become
as
a
sanctuary
But
as
a
stone
to
strike
againstAnd
as
a
rock
to
stumble
overTo
both
houses
of
Israel
As
a
trap
and
a
snareTo
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
15
Many
of
them
will
stumble
and
fall
and
be
broken
They
will
be
ensnared
and
caught
16
Wrap
up
the
written
confirmation
Seal
up
the
law
among
my
disciples
17
I
will
keep
in
expectation
of
Jehovah
who
is
hiding
his
face
from
the
house
of
Jacob
and
I
will
hope
in
him
18
Look
I
and
the
children
whom
Jehovah
has
given
me
are
as
signs
and
as
miracles
in
Israel
from
Jehovah
of
armies
who
resides
on
Mount
Zion
19
And
if
they
say
to
you
Inquire
of
the
spirit
mediums
or
of
the
fortune-tellers
who
chirp
and
mutter

is
it
not
of
their
God
that
a
people
should
inquire
Should
they
inquire
of
the
dead
in
behalf
of
the
living
20
Instead
they
should
inquire
of
the
law
and
of
the
written
confirmation
When
they
do
not
speak
according
to
this
word
they
have
no
light
21
And
each
one
will
pass
through
the
land
afflicted
and
hungry
and
because
he
is
hungry
and
indignant
he
will
curse
his
king
and
his
God
as
he
looks
upward
22
Then
he
will
look
to
the
earth
and
see
only
distress
and
darkness
obscurity
and
hard
times
gloom
and
no
brightness
1
However
the
gloom
will
not
be
as
when
the
land
had
distress
as
in
former
times
when
the
land
of
Zebulun
and
the
land
of
Naphtali
were
treated
with
contempt
But
at
a
later
time
He
will
cause
it
to
be
honored—the
way
by
the
sea
in
the
region
of
the
Jordan
Galilee
of
the
nations

2
The
people
who
were
walking
in
the
darknessHave
seen
a
great
light
As
for
those
dwelling
in
the
land
of
deep
shadow
Light
has
shone
on
them

3
You
have
made
the
nation
populous
You
have
made
its
rejoicing
great
They
rejoice
before
youAs
people
rejoice
in
the
harvesttime
As
those
who
joyfully
divide
up
the
spoil

4
For
you
have
shattered
to
pieces
the
yoke
of
their
load
The
rod
on
their
shoulders
the
staff
of
the
taskmaster
As
in
the
day
of
Midian

5
Every
boot
that
shakes
the
earth
as
it
marchesAnd
every
garment
soaked
in
bloodWill
become
fuel
for
the
fire

6
For
a
child
has
been
born
to
us
A
son
has
been
given
to
us
And
the
rulership
will
rest
on
his
shoulder
His
name
will
be
called
Wonderful
Counselor
Mighty
God
Eternal
Father
Prince
of
Peace

7
To
the
increase
of
his
rulershipAnd
to
peace
there
will
be
no
end
On
the
throne
of
David
and
on
his
kingdomIn
order
to
establish
it
firmly
and
to
sustain
itThrough
justice
and
righteousness
From
now
on
and
forever
The
zeal
of
Jehovah
of
armies
will
do
this

8
Jehovah
sent
a
word
against
Jacob
And
it
has
come
against
Israel

9
And
all
the
people
will
know
it—Ephraim
and
the
inhabitants
of
Samaria—Who
say
in
their
haughtiness
and
in
their
insolence
of
heart
10
Bricks
have
fallen
But
we
will
build
with
hewn
stone
Sycamore
trees
have
been
cut
down
But
we
will
replace
them
with
cedars
11
Jehovah
will
raise
up
Rezins
adversaries
against
himAnd
will
stir
his
enemies
to
action
12
Syria
from
the
east
and
the
Philistines
from
the
west
They
will
devour
Israel
with
open
mouths
In
view
of
all
this
his
anger
has
not
turned
back
But
his
hand
is
still
stretched
out
to
strike
13
For
the
people
have
not
returned
to
the
One
who
strikes
them
They
have
not
sought
Jehovah
of
armies
14
Jehovah
will
cut
off
from
IsraelHead
and
tail
shoot
and
rush
in
one
day
15
The
elder
and
highly
respected
one
is
the
head
And
the
prophet
giving
false
instruction
is
the
tail
16
Those
leading
this
people
are
causing
them
to
wander
And
those
who
are
being
led
are
confused
17
That
is
why
Jehovah
will
not
rejoice
over
their
young
men
And
he
will
have
no
mercy
on
their
fatherless
children
and
their
widowsBecause
all
of
them
are
apostates
and
evildoersAnd
every
mouth
is
speaking
senselessness
In
view
of
all
this
his
anger
has
not
turned
back
But
his
hand
is
still
stretched
out
to
strike
18
For
wickedness
burns
like
a
fire
Consuming
thornbushes
and
weeds
It
will
set
fire
to
the
thickets
of
the
forest
And
they
will
go
up
in
clouds
of
smoke
19
In
the
fury
of
Jehovah
of
armiesThe
land
has
been
set
on
fire
And
the
people
will
become
fuel
for
the
fire
No
one
will
spare
even
his
brother
20
One
will
cut
down
on
the
rightBut
still
be
hungry
And
one
will
eat
on
the
leftBut
will
not
be
satisfied
Each
will
devour
the
flesh
of
his
own
arm
21
Manasseh
will
devour
Ephraim
And
Ephraim
Manasseh
Together
they
will
be
against
Judah
In
view
of
all
this
his
anger
has
not
turned
back
But
his
hand
is
still
stretched
out
to
strike
1
Woe
to
those
who
enact
harmful
regulations
Who
constantly
draft
oppressive
decrees
2
To
deny
the
legal
claim
of
the
poor
To
deprive
the
lowly
among
my
people
of
justice
Making
widows
their
spoilAnd
fatherless
children
their
plunder

3
What
will
you
do
on
the
day
of
reckoning
When
destruction
comes
from
afar
To
whom
will
you
flee
for
assistance
And
where
will
you
leave
your
wealth

4
Nothing
remains
except
to
crouch
among
the
prisonersOr
to
fall
among
the
slain
In
view
of
all
this
his
anger
has
not
turned
back
But
his
hand
is
still
stretched
out
to
strike

5
Aha
the
Assyrian
The
rod
to
express
my
angerAnd
the
staff
in
their
hand
for
my
denunciation

6
I
will
send
him
against
an
apostate
nation
Against
the
people
who
infuriated
me
I
will
command
him
to
take
much
spoil
and
much
plunderAnd
to
trample
them
like
mud
in
the
streets

7
But
he
will
not
be
inclined
this
wayAnd
his
heart
will
not
scheme
this
way
For
it
is
in
his
heart
to
annihilate
To
cut
off
many
nations
not
a
few

8
For
he
says
Are
not
my
princes
all
kings

9
Is
not
Calno
just
like
Carchemish
Is
not
Hamath
like
Arpad
Is
not
Samaria
like
Damascus
10
My
hand
has
seized
the
kingdoms
of
the
worthless
gods
Whose
graven
images
were
more
than
those
of
Jerusalem
and
Samaria
11
Will
I
not
also
do
to
Jerusalem
and
her
idolsJust
as
I
have
done
to
Samaria
and
to
her
worthless
gods
12
When
Jehovah
finishes
all
his
work
on
Mount
Zion
and
in
Jerusalem
He
will
punish
the
king
of
Assyria
for
his
insolent
heart
and
his
proud
arrogant
gaze
13
For
he
says
I
will
do
this
by
the
strength
of
my
handAnd
with
my
wisdom
for
I
am
wise
I
will
remove
the
boundaries
of
peoplesAnd
pillage
their
treasures
And
I
will
subdue
the
inhabitants
like
a
mighty
one
14
Like
a
man
reaching
into
a
nest
My
hand
will
seize
the
resources
of
the
peoples
And
like
one
gathering
abandoned
eggs
I
will
gather
the
whole
earth
No
one
will
flutter
his
wings
or
open
his
mouth
or
chirp
15
Will
the
ax
exalt
itself
over
the
one
who
chops
with
it
Will
the
saw
exalt
itself
over
the
one
who
saws
with
it
Could
a
staff
wave
the
one
who
lifts
it
Or
could
a
rod
lift
up
the
one
who
is
not
made
of
wood
16
Therefore
the
true
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
Will
inflict
emaciation
on
his
fat
ones
And
beneath
his
glory
he
will
kindle
a
blazing
fire
17
Israels
Light
will
become
a
fire
And
his
Holy
One
a
flame
It
will
blaze
up
and
consume
his
weeds
and
his
thornbushes
in
one
day
18
He
will
utterly
do
away
with
the
glory
of
his
forest
and
his
orchard
It
will
be
as
when
a
sick
man
wastes
away
19
The
rest
of
the
trees
of
his
forestWill
be
so
few
that
a
boy
could
list
them
20
In
that
day
those
remaining
of
IsraelAnd
the
survivors
of
the
house
of
JacobWill
no
longer
support
themselves
on
the
one
who
struck
them
But
they
will
support
themselves
on
Jehovah
The
Holy
One
of
Israel
with
faithfulness
21
Only
a
remnant
will
return
The
remnant
of
Jacob
to
the
Mighty
God
22
For
though
your
people
O
Israel
Are
as
the
grains
of
sand
of
the
sea
Only
a
remnant
of
them
will
return
An
extermination
has
been
decided
on
And
justice
will
engulf
them
23
Yes
the
extermination
decided
on
by
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
Will
be
carried
out
in
the
entire
land
24
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Do
not
be
afraid
my
people
who
are
dwelling
in
Zion
because
of
the
Assyrian
who
used
to
strike
you
with
the
rod
and
to
lift
up
his
staff
against
you
as
Egypt
did
25
For
in
a
very
little
while
the
denunciation
will
come
to
an
end
my
anger
will
be
directed
to
their
destruction
26
Jehovah
of
armies
will
brandish
a
whip
against
him
as
when
he
defeated
Midian
by
the
rock
Oreb
And
his
staff
will
be
over
the
sea
and
he
will
raise
it
as
he
did
with
Egypt
27
In
that
day
his
load
will
depart
from
on
your
shoulder
And
his
yoke
from
on
your
neck
And
the
yoke
will
be
broken
because
of
the
oil
28
He
has
come
to
Aiath
He
has
passed
through
Migron
At
Michmash
he
deposits
his
baggage
29
They
have
passed
over
the
ford
They
spend
the
night
at
Geba
Ramah
trembles
Gibeah
of
Saul
has
fled
30
Cry
out
and
scream
O
daughter
of
Gallim
Pay
attention
O
Laishah
O
poor
Anathoth
31
Madmenah
has
run
away
The
inhabitants
of
Gebim
have
sought
shelter
32
This
very
day
he
will
halt
in
Nob
He
shakes
his
fist
at
the
mountain
of
the
daughter
of
Zion
The
hill
of
Jerusalem
33
Look
The
true
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
Is
chopping
off
branches
with
a
terrible
crash
The
tallest
trees
are
being
cut
down
And
the
lofty
are
brought
low
34
He
strikes
down
the
thickets
of
the
forest
with
an
iron
tool
And
Lebanon
will
fall
by
a
mighty
one
1
A
twig
will
grow
out
of
the
stump
of
Jesse
And
a
sprout
from
his
roots
will
bear
fruit

2
And
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
will
settle
upon
him
The
spirit
of
wisdom
and
of
understanding
The
spirit
of
counsel
and
of
mightiness
The
spirit
of
knowledge
and
of
the
fear
of
Jehovah

3
And
he
will
find
delight
in
the
fear
of
Jehovah
He
will
not
judge
by
what
appears
to
his
eyes
Nor
reprove
simply
according
to
what
his
ears
hear

4
He
will
judge
the
lowly
with
fairness
And
with
uprightness
he
will
give
reproof
in
behalf
of
the
meek
ones
of
the
earth
He
will
strike
the
earth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouthAnd
put
the
wicked
to
death
with
the
breath
of
his
lips

5
Righteousness
will
be
the
belt
around
his
waist
And
faithfulness
the
belt
of
his
hips

6
The
wolf
will
reside
for
a
while
with
the
lamb
And
with
the
young
goat
the
leopard
will
lie
down
And
the
calf
and
the
lion
and
the
fattened
animal
will
all
be
together
And
a
little
boy
will
lead
them

7
The
cow
and
the
bear
will
feed
together
And
their
young
will
lie
down
together
The
lion
will
eat
straw
like
the
bull

8
The
nursing
child
will
play
over
the
lair
of
a
cobra
And
a
weaned
child
will
put
his
hand
over
the
den
of
a
poisonous
snake

9
They
will
not
cause
any
harmOr
any
ruin
in
all
my
holy
mountain
Because
the
earth
will
certainly
be
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
JehovahAs
the
waters
cover
the
sea
10
In
that
day
the
root
of
Jesse
will
stand
up
as
a
signal
for
the
peoples
To
him
the
nations
will
turn
for
guidance
And
his
resting-place
will
become
glorious
11
In
that
day
Jehovah
will
again
offer
his
hand
a
second
time
to
reclaim
the
remnant
of
his
people
who
are
left
from
Assyria
from
Egypt
from
Pathros
from
Cush
from
Elam
from
Shinar
from
Hamath
and
from
the
islands
of
the
sea
12
He
will
raise
up
a
signal
for
the
nations
and
gather
the
dispersed
ones
of
Israel
and
he
will
gather
together
the
scattered
ones
of
Judah
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
13
The
jealousy
of
Ephraim
will
be
gone
And
those
who
show
hostility
to
Judah
will
be
done
away
with
Ephraim
will
not
be
jealous
of
Judah
Nor
will
Judah
show
hostility
toward
Ephraim
14
And
they
will
swoop
down
on
the
slopes
of
the
Philistines
to
the
west
Together
they
will
plunder
the
people
of
the
East
They
will
thrust
out
their
hand
against
Edom
and
Moab
And
the
Ammonites
will
become
their
subjects
15
Jehovah
will
divide
the
gulf
of
the
Egyptian
seaAnd
wave
his
hand
over
the
River
With
his
scorching
breath
he
will
strike
it
in
its
seven
torrents
And
he
will
cause
people
to
walk
across
in
their
sandals
16
And
there
will
be
a
highway
out
of
Assyria
for
the
remnant
of
his
people
who
are
left
As
there
was
for
Israel
in
the
day
he
came
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
1
In
that
day
you
will
certainly
say
I
thank
you
O
Jehovah
For
although
you
were
angry
with
me
Your
anger
gradually
subsided
and
you
comforted
me

2
Look
God
is
my
salvation
I
will
trust
and
feel
no
dread
For
Jah
Jehovah
is
my
strength
and
my
might
And
he
has
become
my
salvation

3
With
rejoicing
you
will
draw
waterFrom
the
springs
of
salvation

4
And
in
that
day
you
will
say
Give
thanks
to
Jehovah
call
on
his
name
Make
his
deeds
known
among
the
peoples
Declare
that
his
name
is
exalted

5
Sing
praises
to
Jehovah
for
he
has
done
magnificent
things
Let
this
be
made
known
in
all
the
earth

6
Cry
out
and
shout
for
joy
you
inhabitant
of
Zion
For
great
in
your
midst
is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
1
A
pronouncement
against
Babylon
that
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
saw
in
vision

2
Raise
up
a
signal
on
a
mountain
of
bare
rocks
Call
out
to
them
wave
your
hand
So
that
they
may
come
into
the
entrances
of
the
nobles

3
I
have
issued
the
command
to
those
whom
I
have
appointed
I
have
summoned
my
warriors
to
express
my
anger
My
proudly
exultant
ones

4
Listen
A
crowd
in
the
mountains
It
sounds
like
a
numerous
people
Listen
The
uproar
of
kingdoms
Of
nations
gathered
together
Jehovah
of
armies
is
mustering
the
army
for
war

5
They
are
coming
from
a
distant
land
From
the
extremity
of
the
heavens
Jehovah
and
the
weapons
of
his
wrath
To
bring
ruin
to
all
the
earth

6
Wail
for
the
day
of
Jehovah
is
near
It
will
come
as
a
destruction
from
the
Almighty

7
That
is
why
all
hands
will
go
limp
And
every
mans
heart
will
melt
with
fear

8
The
people
are
panic-stricken
They
are
seized
with
convulsions
and
pain
Like
a
woman
in
labor
They
look
at
one
another
in
horror
With
faces
inflamed
by
anguish

9
Look
The
day
of
Jehovah
is
coming
Cruel
both
with
fury
and
with
burning
anger
To
make
the
land
an
object
of
horror
And
to
annihilate
the
lands
sinners
from
it
10
For
the
stars
of
the
heavens
and
their
constellationsWill
not
give
off
their
light
The
sun
will
be
dark
when
it
rises
And
the
moon
will
not
shed
its
light
11
I
will
call
the
inhabited
earth
to
account
for
its
badness
And
the
wicked
for
their
error
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
pride
of
the
presumptuous
And
I
will
humble
the
haughtiness
of
tyrants
12
I
will
make
mortal
man
scarcer
than
refined
gold
And
humans
scarcer
than
the
gold
of
Ophir
13
That
is
why
I
will
make
the
heavens
tremble
And
the
earth
will
be
shaken
out
of
its
placeAt
the
fury
of
Jehovah
of
armies
in
the
day
of
his
burning
anger
14
Like
a
hunted
gazelle
and
like
a
flock
with
no
one
to
gather
them
Each
will
return
to
his
own
people
Each
will
flee
to
his
own
land
15
Whoever
is
found
will
be
pierced
through
And
whoever
is
caught
will
fall
by
the
sword
16
Their
children
will
be
dashed
to
pieces
before
their
eyes
Their
houses
will
be
looted
And
their
wives
will
be
raped
17
Here
I
am
raising
up
against
them
the
Medes
Who
regard
silver
as
nothingAnd
who
take
no
delight
in
gold
18
Their
bows
will
shatter
young
men
They
will
show
no
pity
on
the
fruit
of
the
wombNor
mercy
to
children
19
And
Babylon
the
most
glorious
of
kingdoms
The
beauty
and
the
pride
of
the
Chaldeans
Will
be
like
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
when
God
overthrew
them
20
She
will
never
be
inhabited
Nor
will
she
be
a
place
to
reside
in
throughout
all
generations
No
Arab
will
pitch
his
tent
there
And
no
shepherds
will
rest
their
flocks
there
21
The
desert
creatures
will
lie
down
there
Their
houses
will
be
filled
with
eagle
owls
The
ostriches
will
reside
there
And
wild
goats
will
skip
about
there
22
Howling
creatures
will
cry
out
in
her
towers
And
jackals
in
her
luxurious
palaces
Her
time
is
near
and
her
days
will
not
be
prolonged
1
For
Jehovah
will
show
mercy
to
Jacob
and
he
will
again
choose
Israel
He
will
settle
them
in
their
land
and
the
foreign
residents
will
join
them
and
attach
themselves
to
the
house
of
Jacob
2
And
peoples
will
take
them
and
bring
them
to
their
own
place
and
the
house
of
Israel
will
possess
them
as
male
and
female
servants
in
Jehovahs
land
and
they
will
be
the
captors
of
those
who
held
them
captive
and
they
will
have
in
subjection
those
who
were
forcing
them
to
work
3
In
the
day
when
Jehovah
gives
you
rest
from
your
pain
and
from
your
turmoil
and
from
the
hard
slavery
imposed
on
you
4
you
will
recite
this
proverb
against
the
king
of
Babylon
How
the
one
forcing
others
to
work
has
met
his
end
How
the
oppression
has
ended

5
Jehovah
has
broken
the
rod
of
the
wicked
The
staff
of
the
rulers
6
The
one
furiously
striking
peoples
with
unceasing
blows
The
one
angrily
subduing
nations
with
relentless
persecution

7
The
whole
earth
now
rests
free
of
disturbance
People
cry
out
for
joy

8
Even
the
juniper
trees
rejoice
over
you
Along
with
the
cedars
of
Lebanon
They
say
Ever
since
you
have
fallen
No
woodcutter
comes
up
against
us

9
Even
the
Grave
underneath
is
stirred
upTo
meet
you
when
you
come
Because
of
you
it
awakens
those
powerless
in
death
All
the
oppressive
leaders
of
the
earth
It
makes
all
the
kings
of
the
nations
rise
from
their
thrones
10
All
of
them
speak
up
and
say
to
you
Have
you
also
become
weak
like
us
Have
you
become
like
us
11
Down
to
the
Grave
your
pride
has
been
brought
The
sound
of
your
stringed
instruments
Maggots
are
spread
beneath
you
as
a
bed
And
worms
are
your
covering
12
How
you
have
fallen
from
heaven
O
shining
one
son
of
the
dawn
How
you
have
been
cut
down
to
the
earth
You
who
vanquished
nations
13
You
said
in
your
heart
I
will
ascend
to
the
heavens
Above
the
stars
of
God
I
will
lift
up
my
throne
And
I
will
sit
down
on
the
mountain
of
meeting
In
the
remotest
parts
of
the
north
14
I
will
go
up
above
the
tops
of
the
clouds
I
will
make
myself
resemble
the
Most
High
15
Instead
you
will
be
brought
down
to
the
Grave
To
the
remotest
parts
of
the
pit
16
Those
seeing
you
will
stare
at
you
They
will
closely
examine
you
saying
Is
this
the
man
who
was
shaking
the
earth
Who
made
kingdoms
tremble
17
Who
made
the
inhabited
earth
like
the
wildernessAnd
overthrew
its
cities
Who
refused
to
let
his
prisoners
go
home
18
All
other
kings
of
the
nations
Yes
all
of
them
lie
down
in
glory
Each
one
in
his
own
tomb
19
But
you
are
discarded
without
a
grave
Like
a
detested
sprout
Clothed
with
the
slain
who
were
stabbed
with
the
sword
Who
go
down
to
the
stones
of
a
pit
Like
a
carcass
trampled
underfoot
20
You
will
not
join
them
in
a
grave
For
you
destroyed
your
own
land
You
killed
your
own
people
The
offspring
of
evildoers
will
never
again
be
named
21
Prepare
a
slaughtering
block
for
his
sonsBecause
of
the
guilt
of
their
forefathers
So
that
they
will
not
rise
up
and
take
over
the
earthAnd
fill
the
land
with
their
cities
22
I
will
rise
up
against
them

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
And
I
will
wipe
out
from
Babylon
name
and
remnant
and
descendants
and
posterity

declares
Jehovah
23
And
I
will
make
her
a
possession
of
porcupines
and
a
region
of
marshes
and
I
will
sweep
her
with
the
broom
of
annihilation

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
24
Jehovah
of
armies
has
sworn
Just
as
I
have
intended
so
it
will
occur
And
just
as
I
have
decided
that
is
what
will
come
true
25
I
will
crush
the
Assyrian
in
my
land
And
I
will
trample
him
on
my
mountains
His
yoke
will
be
removed
from
them
And
his
load
will
be
removed
from
their
shoulder
26
This
is
what
has
been
decided
against
all
the
earth
And
this
is
the
hand
that
is
stretched
out
against
all
the
nations
27
For
Jehovah
of
armies
has
decided
And
who
can
thwart
it
His
hand
is
stretched
out
And
who
can
turn
it
back
28
In
the
year
that
King
Ahaz
died
this
pronouncement
was
made
29
Do
not
rejoice
Philistia
any
of
you
Just
because
the
staff
of
the
one
striking
you
has
been
broken
For
from
the
root
of
the
serpent
will
come
a
poisonous
snake
And
its
offspring
will
be
a
flying
fiery
snake
30
While
the
firstborn
of
the
lowly
feedAnd
the
poor
lie
down
in
security
I
will
put
your
root
to
death
with
famine
And
what
is
left
of
you
will
be
killed
31
Wail
O
gate
Cry
out
O
city
All
of
you
will
lose
heart
O
Philistia
For
a
smoke
is
coming
from
the
north
And
there
are
no
stragglers
in
his
ranks
32
How
should
they
answer
the
messengers
of
the
nation
That
Jehovah
has
laid
the
foundation
of
Zion
And
that
the
lowly
ones
of
his
people
will
take
refuge
in
her
1
A
pronouncement
against
Moab
Because
it
has
been
devastated
in
a
night
Ar
of
Moab
has
been
silenced
Because
it
has
been
devastated
in
a
night
Kir
of
Moab
has
been
silenced

2
He
has
gone
up
to
the
House
and
to
Dibon
To
the
high
places
to
weep
Moab
wails
over
Nebo
and
over
Medeba
Every
head
is
shaved
bald
every
beard
is
clipped

3
In
its
streets
they
have
put
on
sackcloth
On
their
roofs
and
in
their
public
squares
they
all
wail
They
go
down
weeping

4
Heshbon
and
Elealeh
cry
out
Their
voice
is
heard
as
far
as
Jahaz
That
is
why
the
armed
men
of
Moab
keep
shouting
He
is
trembling

5
My
heart
cries
out
over
Moab
Its
fugitives
have
fled
as
far
as
Zoar
and
Eglath-shelishiyah
On
the
ascent
of
Luhith
they
weep
as
they
go
up
On
the
way
to
Horonaim
they
cry
out
over
the
catastrophe

6
For
the
waters
of
Nimrim
are
desolate
The
green
grass
has
dried
up
The
grass
is
gone
and
nothing
green
is
left

7
That
is
why
they
are
carrying
away
what
is
left
of
their
stores
and
their
riches
They
are
crossing
the
valley
of
poplars

8
For
the
outcry
echoes
throughout
the
territory
of
Moab
The
wailing
reaches
to
Eglaim
The
wailing
reaches
to
Beer-elim

9
For
the
waters
of
Dimon
are
full
of
blood
And
I
have
more
in
store
for
Dimon
A
lion
for
those
of
Moab
who
escapeAnd
for
those
remaining
in
the
land
1
Send
a
ram
to
the
ruler
of
the
land
From
Sela
through
the
wildernessTo
the
mountain
of
the
daughter
of
Zion

2
Like
a
bird
chased
away
from
its
nest
So
the
daughters
of
Moab
will
be
at
the
fords
of
Arnon

3
Offer
counsel
carry
out
the
decision
Make
your
shadow
at
high
noon
like
the
night
Conceal
the
dispersed
and
do
not
betray
those
fleeing

4
May
my
dispersed
ones
reside
in
you
O
Moab
Become
a
place
of
concealment
to
them
because
of
the
destroyer
The
oppressor
will
reach
his
end
The
destruction
will
come
to
an
end
And
those
trampling
others
down
will
perish
from
the
earth

5
Then
a
throne
will
be
firmly
established
in
loyal
love
The
one
who
sits
on
it
in
the
tent
of
David
will
be
faithful
He
will
judge
fairly
and
will
swiftly
execute
righteousness

6
We
have
heard
about
the
pride
of
Moab—he
is
very
proud—His
haughtiness
and
his
pride
and
his
fury
But
his
empty
talk
will
come
to
nothing

7
So
Moab
will
wail
for
Moab
They
will
all
wail
Those
who
are
stricken
will
moan
for
the
raisin
cakes
of
Kir-hareseth

8
For
the
terraces
of
Heshbon
have
withered
The
vine
of
Sibmah
The
rulers
of
the
nations
have
trampled
its
bright-red
branches
They
had
reached
as
far
as
Jazer
They
had
extended
into
the
wilderness
Its
shoots
had
spread
out
and
gone
as
far
as
the
sea

9
That
is
why
I
will
weep
over
the
vine
of
Sibmah
as
I
weep
for
Jazer
With
my
tears
I
will
drench
you
O
Heshbon
and
Elealeh
Because
the
shouting
over
your
summer
fruit
and
your
harvest
has
ended
10
Rejoicing
and
joyfulness
have
been
taken
away
from
the
orchard
And
there
are
no
songs
of
joy
or
shouting
in
the
vineyards
The
treader
no
longer
treads
out
wine
in
the
presses
For
I
have
caused
the
shouting
to
cease
11
That
is
why
deep
within
me
I
am
boisterous
over
Moab
Like
the
strumming
of
a
harp
And
my
innermost
being
over
Kir-hareseth
12
Even
when
Moab
wears
himself
out
on
the
high
place
and
goes
to
pray
in
his
sanctuary
he
will
accomplish
nothing
13
This
is
the
word
that
Jehovah
previously
spoke
concerning
Moab
14
And
now
Jehovah
says
Within
three
years
like
the
years
of
a
hired
worker
the
glory
of
Moab
will
be
disgraced
with
much
tumult
of
every
sort
and
those
who
remain
will
be
very
few
and
insignificant
1
A
pronouncement
against
Damascus
Look
Damascus
will
cease
to
be
a
city
And
it
will
become
a
heap
of
ruins

2
The
cities
of
Aroer
will
be
abandoned
They
will
become
places
for
flocks
to
lie
downWith
no
one
to
make
them
afraid

3
Fortified
cities
will
disappear
from
Ephraim
And
the
kingdom
from
Damascus
And
those
remaining
of
SyriaWill
be
like
the
glory
of
the
Israelites

declares
Jehovah
of
armies

4
In
that
day
the
glory
of
Jacob
will
diminish
And
his
healthy
body
will
grow
thin

5
It
will
be
as
when
the
harvester
is
gathering
the
standing
grainAnd
his
arm
harvests
the
ears
of
grain
Like
when
one
gleans
grain
in
the
Valley
of
Rephaim

6
Only
gleanings
will
be
left
As
when
an
olive
tree
is
beaten
Only
two
or
three
ripe
olives
remain
on
the
highest
branch
Only
four
or
five
on
its
fruit-bearing
branches

declares
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
7
In
that
day
man
will
look
up
to
his
Maker
and
his
eyes
will
gaze
at
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
8
He
will
not
look
to
the
altars
the
work
of
his
hands
and
he
will
not
gaze
at
what
his
fingers
have
made
either
the
sacred
poles
or
the
incense
stands

9
In
that
day
his
fortress
cities
will
become
like
an
abandoned
site
in
the
woodland
Like
a
branch
that
was
abandoned
before
the
Israelites
It
will
become
a
wasteland
10
For
you
have
forgotten
the
God
of
your
salvation
You
have
failed
to
remember
the
Rock
of
your
fortress
That
is
why
you
plant
beautiful
plantationsAnd
set
it
with
the
shoot
of
a
stranger
11
In
the
day
you
carefully
fence
in
your
plantation
In
the
morning
you
make
your
seed
sprout
But
the
harvest
will
vanish
in
the
day
of
disease
and
incurable
pain
12
Listen
There
is
a
commotion
of
many
peoples
Who
are
as
boisterous
as
the
seas
There
is
an
uproar
of
nations
Whose
sound
is
like
the
roar
of
mighty
waters
13
The
nations
will
make
a
sound
like
the
roar
of
many
waters
He
will
rebuke
them
and
they
will
flee
far
away
Chased
like
the
chaff
of
the
mountains
before
a
wind
Like
a
whirling
thistle
before
a
storm
wind
14
In
the
evening
there
is
terror
Before
morning
they
are
no
more
This
is
the
share
of
those
pillaging
usAnd
the
lot
of
those
plundering
us
1
Woe
to
the
land
of
whirring
insect
wingsIn
the
region
of
the
rivers
of
Ethiopia

2
It
sends
envoys
by
sea
Across
the
waters
in
papyrus
vessels
saying
Go
you
swift
messengers
To
a
tall
and
smooth-skinned
nation
To
a
people
feared
everywhere
To
a
strong
conquering
nation
Whose
land
is
washed
away
by
rivers

3
All
you
inhabitants
of
the
land
and
you
residents
of
the
earth
What
you
see
will
be
like
a
signal
raised
on
the
mountains
And
you
will
hear
a
sound
like
the
blowing
of
a
horn

4
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
said
to
me
I
will
remain
undisturbed
and
look
on
my
established
place
Like
the
shimmering
heat
along
with
the
sunlight
Like
the
cloud
of
dew
in
the
heat
of
harvest

5
For
before
the
harvest
When
the
blossom
is
finished
and
the
bloom
becomes
a
ripening
grape
The
shoots
will
be
cut
off
with
pruning
shearsAnd
the
tendrils
will
be
lopped
off
and
removed

6
They
will
all
be
left
for
the
birds
of
prey
of
the
mountainsAnd
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth
The
birds
of
prey
will
spend
the
summer
on
them
And
all
the
beasts
of
the
earth
will
spend
the
harvesttime
on
them

7
At
that
time
a
gift
will
be
brought
to
Jehovah
of
armies
From
a
tall
and
smooth-skinned
nation
From
a
people
feared
everywhere
From
a
strong
conquering
nation
Whose
land
is
washed
away
by
riversTo
the
place
that
bears
the
name
of
Jehovah
of
armies
Mount
Zion
1
A
pronouncement
against
Egypt
Look
Jehovah
is
riding
on
a
swift
cloud
and
is
coming
into
Egypt
The
worthless
gods
of
Egypt
will
tremble
before
him
And
the
heart
of
Egypt
will
melt
within
it

2
I
will
incite
Egyptians
against
Egyptians
And
they
will
fight
one
another
Each
against
his
brother
and
his
neighbor
City
against
city
kingdom
against
kingdom

3
And
the
spirit
of
Egypt
will
become
bewildered
within
it
And
I
will
confuse
its
plans
They
will
resort
to
the
worthless
gods
To
the
charmers
and
to
the
spirit
mediums
and
to
the
fortune-tellers

4
I
will
hand
Egypt
over
to
a
hard
master
And
a
harsh
king
will
rule
over
them

declares
the
true
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies

5
The
water
of
the
sea
will
be
dried
up
And
the
river
will
become
parched
and
run
dry

6
And
the
rivers
will
stink
The
Nile
canals
of
Egypt
will
become
low
and
parched
The
reeds
and
the
rushes
will
decay

7
The
plants
along
the
Nile
River
at
the
mouth
of
the
Nile
And
all
the
land
sown
with
seed
along
the
Nile
will
dry
up
It
will
be
blown
away
and
it
will
be
no
more

8
And
the
fishermen
will
mourn
Those
casting
fishhooks
into
the
Nile
will
lament
And
those
who
spread
their
nets
on
the
water
will
dwindle

9
Those
who
work
in
combed
flaxAnd
those
making
white
fabric
on
the
loom
will
be
put
to
shame
10
Her
weavers
will
be
crushed
All
the
hired
workers
will
grieve
11
The
princes
of
Zoan
are
foolish
The
wisest
advisers
of
Pharaoh
give
unreasonable
advice
How
can
you
say
to
Pharaoh
I
am
a
descendant
of
wise
ones
A
descendant
of
ancient
kings
12
Where
then
are
your
wise
men
Let
them
tell
you
if
they
know
what
Jehovah
of
armies
has
decided
concerning
Egypt
13
The
princes
of
Zoan
have
acted
foolishly
The
princes
of
Noph
have
been
deceived
The
chiefs
of
her
tribes
have
led
Egypt
astray
14
Jehovah
has
poured
out
on
her
a
spirit
of
confusion
And
they
have
led
Egypt
astray
in
whatever
she
does
Like
a
drunk
staggering
in
his
vomit
15
And
Egypt
will
not
have
any
work
to
do
Whether
for
the
head
or
the
tail
the
shoot
or
the
rush
16
In
that
day
Egypt
will
become
like
women
trembling
and
terrified
because
of
the
threatening
hand
that
Jehovah
of
armies
raises
against
it
17
And
the
land
of
Judah
will
become
a
cause
for
terror
to
Egypt
They
will
feel
dread
at
the
mention
of
it
because
of
the
decision
that
Jehovah
of
armies
has
made
against
them
18
In
that
day
there
will
be
five
cities
in
the
land
of
Egypt
speaking
the
language
of
Canaan
and
swearing
loyalty
to
Jehovah
of
armies
One
city
will
be
called
The
City
of
Tearing
Down
19
In
that
day
there
will
be
an
altar
to
Jehovah
in
the
middle
of
the
land
of
Egypt
and
a
pillar
to
Jehovah
at
its
boundary
20
It
will
be
for
a
sign
and
for
a
witness
to
Jehovah
of
armies
in
the
land
of
Egypt
for
they
will
cry
out
to
Jehovah
because
of
the
oppressors
and
he
will
send
them
a
savior
a
grand
one
who
will
save
them
21
And
Jehovah
will
become
known
to
the
Egyptians
and
the
Egyptians
will
know
Jehovah
in
that
day
and
they
will
offer
sacrifices
and
gifts
and
make
a
vow
to
Jehovah
and
pay
it
22
Jehovah
will
strike
Egypt
striking
and
healing
it
and
they
will
return
to
Jehovah
and
he
will
respond
to
their
entreaties
and
heal
them
23
In
that
day
there
will
be
a
highway
out
of
Egypt
to
Assyria
Then
Assyria
will
come
into
Egypt
and
Egypt
into
Assyria
and
Egypt
will
serve
God
together
with
Assyria
24
In
that
day
Israel
will
be
the
third
along
with
Egypt
and
with
Assyria
a
blessing
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
25
for
Jehovah
of
armies
will
have
blessed
it
saying
Blessed
be
my
people
Egypt
and
the
work
of
my
hands
Assyria
and
my
inheritance
Israel
1
In
the
year
that
King
Sargon
of
Assyria
sent
the
Tartan
to
Ashdod
he
fought
against
Ashdod
and
captured
it
2
At
that
time
Jehovah
spoke
through
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
saying
Go
remove
the
sackcloth
from
your
hips
and
take
your
sandals
off
your
feet
And
he
did
so
walking
about
naked
and
barefoot
3
Jehovah
then
said
Just
as
my
servant
Isaiah
has
walked
about
naked
and
barefoot
for
three
years
as
a
sign
and
a
portent
against
Egypt
and
Ethiopia
4
so
the
king
of
Assyria
will
lead
the
captives
of
Egypt
and
the
exiles
of
Ethiopia
boys
and
old
men
naked
and
barefoot
and
with
exposed
buttocks
the
nakedness
of
Egypt
5
And
they
will
be
terrified
and
will
be
ashamed
of
Ethiopia
their
hope
and
of
Egypt
their
pride
6
The
inhabitants
of
this
coastland
will
say
in
that
day
Look
at
what
happened
to
our
hope
to
which
we
fled
for
help
and
rescue
from
the
king
of
Assyria
How
will
we
escape
now
1
A
pronouncement
against
the
wilderness
of
the
sea
It
is
coming
like
storm
winds
that
sweep
through
in
the
south
From
the
wilderness
from
a
fearsome
land

2
A
harsh
vision
has
been
told
to
me
The
treacherous
one
is
acting
treacherously
And
the
destroyer
is
destroying
Go
up
O
Elam
Lay
siege
O
Media
I
will
put
an
end
to
all
the
sighing
she
caused

3
That
is
why
I
am
in
great
anguish
Convulsions
have
seized
me
Like
those
of
a
woman
giving
birth
I
am
too
distressed
to
hear
I
am
too
disturbed
to
see

4
My
heart
falters
I
shudder
in
terror
The
twilight
I
longed
for
makes
me
tremble

5
Set
the
table
and
arrange
the
seats
Eat
and
drink
Get
up
you
princes
anoint
the
shield

6
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
said
to
me
Go
post
a
lookout
and
have
him
report
what
he
sees

7
And
he
saw
a
war
chariot
with
a
team
of
horses
A
war
chariot
of
donkeys
A
war
chariot
of
camels
He
watched
carefully
with
great
attentiveness

8
Then
he
called
out
like
a
lion
Upon
the
watchtower
O
Jehovah
I
am
standing
constantly
by
day
And
I
am
stationed
at
my
guardpost
every
night

9
Look
at
what
is
coming
Men
in
a
war
chariot
with
a
team
of
horses
Then
he
spoke
up
and
said
She
has
fallen
Babylon
has
fallen
All
the
graven
images
of
her
gods
he
has
shattered
to
the
ground
10
O
my
people
who
have
been
threshed
The
product
of
my
threshing
floor
I
have
reported
to
you
what
I
have
heard
from
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
11
A
pronouncement
against
Dumah
Someone
is
calling
out
to
me
from
Seir
Watchman
what
of
the
night
Watchman
what
of
the
night
12
The
watchman
said
The
morning
is
coming
and
also
the
night
If
you
would
inquire
inquire
Come
again
13
A
pronouncement
against
the
desert
plain
In
the
forest
in
the
desert
plain
you
will
spend
the
night
O
caravans
of
Dedan
14
Bring
water
to
meet
the
thirsty
one
You
inhabitants
of
the
land
of
Tema
And
bring
bread
for
the
one
fleeing
15
For
they
have
fled
from
the
swords
from
the
drawn
sword
From
the
bent
bow
and
from
the
cruelty
of
the
war
16
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
said
to
me
Within
one
year
like
the
years
of
a
hired
worker
all
the
glory
of
Kedar
will
come
to
an
end
17
The
remaining
bowmen
of
the
warriors
of
Kedar
will
be
few
for
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
has
spoken
1
A
pronouncement
about
the
Valley
of
Vision
What
is
the
matter
with
you
that
you
have
all
gone
up
to
the
roofs

2
You
were
full
of
turmoil
A
boisterous
city
an
exultant
town
Your
slain
were
not
slain
with
the
sword
Nor
did
they
die
in
battle

3
All
your
dictators
have
fled
together
They
were
taken
prisoner
without
need
of
a
bow
All
who
were
found
were
taken
prisoner
Even
though
they
had
fled
far
away

4
That
is
why
I
said
Turn
your
eyes
away
from
me
And
I
will
weep
bitterly
Do
not
insist
on
comforting
meOver
the
destruction
of
the
daughter
of
my
people

5
For
it
is
a
day
of
confusion
and
of
defeat
and
of
panic
From
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
In
the
Valley
of
Vision
There
is
a
demolishing
of
the
wallAnd
a
cry
to
the
mountain

6
Elam
picks
up
the
quiverWith
manned
chariots
and
horses
And
Kir
uncovers
the
shield

7
Your
choicest
valleysWill
become
full
of
war
chariots
And
the
horses
will
take
their
positions
at
the
gate
8
And
the
screen
of
Judah
will
be
removed
In
that
day
you
will
look
toward
the
armory
of
the
House
of
the
Forest
9
and
you
will
see
the
many
breaches
of
the
City
of
David
And
you
will
collect
the
waters
of
the
lower
pool
10
You
will
count
the
houses
of
Jerusalem
and
you
will
pull
down
the
houses
to
reinforce
the
wall
11
And
you
will
make
a
basin
between
the
two
walls
for
the
water
of
the
old
pool
but
you
will
not
look
to
its
Grand
Maker
and
you
will
not
see
the
One
who
formed
it
long
ago
12
In
that
day
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
Will
call
for
weeping
and
mourning
For
shaved
heads
and
the
wearing
of
sackcloth
13
But
instead
there
is
celebration
and
rejoicing
The
killing
of
cattle
and
the
slaughtering
of
sheep
The
eating
of
meat
and
the
drinking
of
wine
Let
us
eat
and
drink
for
tomorrow
we
will
die
14
Then
Jehovah
of
armies
revealed
himself
in
my
ears
This
error
will
not
be
atoned
in
your
behalf
until
you
people
die

says
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
15
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Go
in
to
this
steward
to
Shebna
who
is
in
charge
of
the
house
and
say
16
What
is
your
interest
here
and
who
is
there
of
interest
to
you
here
that
you
hewed
out
a
burial
place
here
for
yourself
He
is
hewing
out
his
burial
place
in
a
high
place
he
is
cutting
out
a
resting-place
for
himself
in
a
crag
17
Look
Jehovah
will
hurl
you
down
violently
O
man
and
seize
you
forcibly
18
He
will
certainly
wrap
you
up
tightly
and
hurl
you
like
a
ball
into
a
wide
land
There
you
will
die
and
there
your
glorious
chariots
will
be
a
disgrace
to
your
masters
house
19
And
I
will
depose
you
from
your
position
and
throw
you
out
of
your
office
20
In
that
day
I
will
call
my
servant
Eliakim
the
son
of
Hilkiah
21
and
I
will
clothe
him
with
your
robe
and
firmly
bind
your
sash
around
him
and
I
will
give
your
authority
into
his
hand
And
he
will
be
a
father
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
and
to
the
house
of
Judah
22
And
I
will
put
the
key
of
the
house
of
David
on
his
shoulder
He
will
open
and
no
one
will
shut
and
he
will
shut
and
no
one
will
open
23
I
will
drive
him
in
as
a
peg
in
a
lasting
place
and
he
will
become
as
a
throne
of
glory
to
the
house
of
his
father
24
And
they
will
hang
on
him
all
the
glory
of
the
house
of
his
father
the
descendants
and
the
offspring
all
the
small
vessels
the
bowl-shaped
vessels
as
well
as
all
the
large
jars
25
In
that
day

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
the
peg
that
is
driven
in
a
lasting
place
will
be
removed
and
it
will
be
cut
down
and
fall
and
the
load
that
it
supported
will
fall
to
ruin
for
Jehovah
himself
has
spoken
1
A
pronouncement
about
Tyre
Wail
you
ships
of
Tarshish
For
the
port
has
been
destroyed
it
cannot
be
entered
From
the
land
of
Kittim
it
has
been
revealed
to
them

2
Be
silent
you
inhabitants
of
the
coastland
The
merchants
from
Sidon
who
cross
the
sea
have
filled
you

3
Over
many
waters
went
the
grain
of
Shihor
The
harvest
of
the
Nile
her
revenue
Bringing
the
profit
of
the
nations

4
Be
ashamed
O
Sidon
you
stronghold
of
the
sea
Because
the
sea
has
said
I
have
not
had
birth
pains
and
I
have
not
given
birth
Nor
have
I
brought
up
young
men
or
raised
young
women

5
As
when
they
heard
the
report
about
Egypt
People
will
be
in
anguish
over
the
report
about
Tyre

6
Cross
over
to
Tarshish
Wail
you
inhabitants
of
the
coastland

7
Is
this
your
city
that
was
exultant
from
long
ago
from
her
early
times
Her
feet
used
to
take
her
to
distant
lands
to
reside

8
Who
has
decided
this
against
Tyre
The
bestower
of
crowns
Whose
merchants
were
princes
Whose
tradesmen
were
honored
in
all
the
earth

9
Jehovah
of
armies
himself
has
decided
this
To
profane
her
pride
over
all
her
beauty
To
humiliate
all
those
who
were
honored
throughout
the
earth
10
Cross
over
your
land
like
the
Nile
River
O
daughter
of
Tarshish
There
is
no
longer
any
shipyard
11
He
has
stretched
his
hand
out
over
the
sea
He
has
shaken
kingdoms
Jehovah
has
ordered
the
annihilation
of
Phoenicias
strongholds
12
And
he
says
You
will
exult
no
more
O
oppressed
one
the
virgin
daughter
of
Sidon
Get
up
cross
over
to
Kittim
Even
there
you
will
find
no
rest
13
Look
The
land
of
the
Chaldeans
This
is
the
people—Assyria
was
not
the
one—They
made
her
a
place
for
those
haunting
the
desert
They
have
erected
their
siege
towers
They
have
stripped
bare
her
fortified
towers
Reducing
her
to
a
crumbling
ruin
14
Wail
you
ships
of
Tarshish
For
your
stronghold
has
been
destroyed
15
In
that
day
Tyre
will
be
forgotten
for
70
years
the
same
as
the
lifetime
of
one
king
At
the
end
of
70
years
it
will
happen
to
Tyre
as
in
the
song
of
a
prostitute
16
Take
a
harp
go
around
the
city
O
forgotten
prostitute
Play
your
harp
skillfully
Sing
many
songs
So
that
they
will
remember
you
17
At
the
end
of
70
years
Jehovah
will
turn
his
attention
to
Tyre
and
she
will
return
to
her
hire
and
prostitute
herself
with
all
the
worlds
kingdoms
on
the
face
of
the
earth
18
But
her
profit
and
her
hire
will
become
something
holy
to
Jehovah
It
will
not
be
stored
or
laid
away
because
her
hire
will
be
for
those
dwelling
before
Jehovah
so
that
they
may
eat
to
satisfaction
and
wear
elegant
clothing
1
Look
Jehovah
is
emptying
the
land
and
making
it
desolate
He
turns
it
upside
down
and
scatters
its
inhabitants

2
It
will
be
the
same
for
everyone
The
people
as
well
as
the
priest
The
servant
and
his
master
The
servant
and
her
mistress
The
buyer
and
the
seller
The
lender
and
the
borrower
The
creditor
and
the
debtor

3
The
land
will
be
completely
emptied
It
will
be
completely
plundered
For
Jehovah
has
spoken
this
word

4
The
land
mourns
it
is
wasting
away
The
productive
land
withers
it
is
fading
away
The
prominent
people
of
the
land
wither

5
The
land
has
been
polluted
by
its
inhabitants
For
they
have
bypassed
the
laws
Changed
the
regulation
And
broken
the
lasting
covenant

6
That
is
why
the
curse
devours
the
land
And
those
inhabiting
it
are
held
guilty
That
is
why
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
have
dwindled
And
very
few
men
are
left

7
The
new
wine
mourns
the
vine
withers
And
all
those
cheerful
at
heart
are
sighing

8
The
joy
of
the
tambourines
has
ceased
The
noise
of
the
revelers
has
ended
The
happy
sound
of
the
harp
has
ceased

9
They
drink
wine
without
song
And
alcohol
tastes
bitter
to
those
drinking
it
10
The
deserted
town
is
broken
down
Every
house
is
shut
up
so
that
no
one
can
enter
11
They
cry
out
for
wine
in
the
streets
All
rejoicing
has
disappeared
The
joy
of
the
land
has
gone
12
The
city
is
left
in
ruins
The
gate
has
been
crushed
to
a
heap
of
rubble
13
For
this
is
how
it
will
be
in
the
land
among
the
peoples
As
when
an
olive
tree
is
beaten
Like
the
gleaning
when
the
grape
harvest
comes
to
an
end
14
They
will
raise
their
voice
They
will
shout
joyfully
From
the
sea
they
will
proclaim
the
majesty
of
Jehovah
15
That
is
why
they
will
glorify
Jehovah
in
the
region
of
light
In
the
islands
of
the
sea
they
will
glorify
the
name
of
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
16
From
the
ends
of
the
earth
we
hear
songs
Glory
to
the
Righteous
One
But
I
say
I
am
wasting
away
I
am
wasting
away
Woe
to
me
The
treacherous
have
acted
treacherously
With
treachery
the
treacherous
have
acted
treacherously
17
Terror
and
pits
and
traps
await
you
inhabitant
of
the
land
18
Anyone
fleeing
from
the
sound
of
terror
will
fall
into
the
pit
And
anyone
coming
up
from
the
pit
will
be
caught
in
the
trap
For
the
floodgates
above
will
be
opened
And
the
foundations
of
the
land
will
quake
19
The
land
has
burst
apart
The
land
has
been
shaken
up
The
land
convulses
violently
20
The
land
staggers
like
a
drunken
man
And
it
sways
back
and
forth
like
a
hut
in
the
wind
Its
transgression
weighs
heavily
on
it
And
it
will
fall
so
that
it
will
not
rise
up
again
21
In
that
day
Jehovah
will
turn
his
attention
to
the
army
of
the
heights
aboveAnd
to
the
kings
of
the
earth
upon
the
earth
22
And
they
will
be
gathered
togetherLike
prisoners
gathered
into
a
pit
And
they
will
be
shut
up
in
the
dungeon
After
many
days
they
will
be
given
attention
23
The
full
moon
will
be
abashed
And
the
shining
sun
will
be
ashamed
For
Jehovah
of
armies
has
become
King
in
Mount
Zion
and
in
Jerusalem
Glorious
before
the
elders
of
his
people
1
O
Jehovah
you
are
my
God
I
exalt
you
I
praise
your
name
For
you
have
done
wonderful
things
Things
purposed
from
ancient
times
In
faithfulness
in
trustworthiness

2
For
you
have
turned
a
city
into
a
pile
of
stones
A
fortified
town
into
a
crumbling
ruin
The
foreigners
tower
is
a
city
no
more
It
will
never
be
rebuilt

3
That
is
why
a
strong
people
will
glorify
you
The
city
of
tyrannical
nations
will
fear
you

4
For
you
have
become
a
stronghold
to
the
lowly
A
stronghold
to
the
poor
in
his
distress
A
refuge
from
the
rainstorm
And
a
shade
from
the
heat
When
the
blast
of
the
tyrants
is
like
a
rainstorm
against
a
wall
5
As
the
heat
in
a
parched
land
You
subdue
the
uproar
of
strangers
Like
heat
is
subdued
by
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
So
the
song
of
the
tyrants
is
silenced

6
In
this
mountain
Jehovah
of
armies
will
make
for
all
the
peoplesA
banquet
of
rich
dishes
A
banquet
of
fine
wine
Of
rich
dishes
filled
with
marrow
Of
fine
filtered
wine

7
In
this
mountain
he
will
do
away
with
the
shroud
that
is
enveloping
all
the
peoplesAnd
the
covering
that
is
woven
over
all
the
nations

8
He
will
swallow
up
death
forever
And
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
will
wipe
away
the
tears
from
all
faces
The
reproach
of
his
people
he
will
take
away
from
all
the
earth
For
Jehovah
himself
has
spoken
it

9
In
that
day
they
will
say
Look
This
is
our
God
We
have
hoped
in
him
And
he
will
save
us
This
is
Jehovah
We
have
hoped
in
him
Let
us
be
joyful
and
rejoice
in
the
salvation
by
him
10
For
the
hand
of
Jehovah
will
rest
on
this
mountain
And
Moab
will
be
trampled
on
in
its
placeLike
straw
trampled
into
a
pile
of
manure
11
He
will
slap
out
his
hands
into
itLike
a
swimmer
slapping
out
his
hands
to
swim
And
he
will
bring
down
its
haughtinessWith
the
skillful
movements
of
his
hands
12
And
the
fortified
city
with
your
high
walls
of
security
He
will
bring
down
He
will
knock
it
down
to
the
ground
to
the
very
dust
1
In
that
day
this
song
will
be
sung
in
the
land
of
Judah
We
have
a
strong
city
He
makes
salvation
its
walls
and
its
ramparts

2
Open
up
the
gates
so
that
the
righteous
nation
may
enter
A
nation
that
is
keeping
faithful
conduct

3
You
will
safeguard
those
who
fully
lean
on
you
You
will
give
them
continuous
peace
Because
it
is
in
you
that
they
trust

4
Trust
in
Jehovah
forever
For
Jah
Jehovah
is
the
eternal
Rock

5
For
he
has
brought
low
those
inhabiting
the
height
the
lofty
city
He
brings
it
down
He
brings
it
down
to
the
earth
He
casts
it
down
to
the
dust

6
The
foot
will
trample
it
The
feet
of
the
afflicted
the
steps
of
the
lowly

7
The
path
of
the
righteous
one
is
upright
Because
you
are
upright
You
will
smooth
out
the
course
of
the
righteous

8
As
we
follow
the
path
of
your
judgments
O
Jehovah
Our
hope
is
in
you
We
long
for
your
name
and
your
memorial

9
In
the
night
I
long
for
you
with
my
whole
being
Yes
my
spirit
keeps
looking
for
you
For
when
there
are
judgments
from
you
for
the
earth
The
inhabitants
of
the
land
learn
about
righteousness
10
Even
if
the
wicked
is
shown
favor
He
will
not
learn
righteousness
Even
in
the
land
of
uprightness
he
will
act
wickedly
And
he
will
not
see
the
majesty
of
Jehovah
11
O
Jehovah
your
hand
is
raised
but
they
do
not
see
it
They
will
see
your
zeal
for
your
people
and
be
put
to
shame
Yes
the
fire
for
your
adversaries
will
consume
them
12
O
Jehovah
you
will
grant
us
peace
Because
everything
we
have
doneYou
have
accomplished
for
us
13
O
Jehovah
our
God
other
masters
besides
you
have
ruled
over
us
But
we
make
mention
of
your
name
alone
14
They
are
dead
they
will
not
live
Powerless
in
death
they
will
not
rise
up
For
you
have
turned
your
attention
to
themTo
annihilate
them
and
destroy
all
mention
of
them
15
You
have
enlarged
the
nation
O
Jehovah
You
have
enlarged
the
nation
You
have
glorified
yourself
You
have
greatly
extended
all
the
borders
of
the
land
16
O
Jehovah
during
distress
they
turned
to
you
They
poured
out
their
prayer
in
a
whisper
when
you
disciplined
them
17
Just
as
a
pregnant
woman
about
to
give
birthHas
labor
pains
and
cries
out
in
pain
So
we
have
been
because
of
you
O
Jehovah
18
We
became
pregnant
we
had
labor
pains
But
it
is
as
if
we
have
given
birth
to
wind
We
have
not
brought
salvation
to
the
land
And
no
one
is
born
to
inhabit
the
land
19
Your
dead
will
live
My
corpses
will
rise
up
Awake
and
shout
joyfully
You
residents
in
the
dust
For
your
dew
is
as
the
dew
of
the
morning
And
the
earth
will
let
those
powerless
in
death
come
to
life
20
Go
my
people
enter
your
inner
rooms
And
shut
your
doors
behind
you
Hide
yourself
for
a
brief
momentUntil
the
wrath
has

For
look
Jehovah
is
coming
from
his
placeTo
call
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
to
account
for
their
error
And
the
land
will
expose
her
bloodshedAnd
will
no
longer
cover
over
her
slain
1
In
that
day
Jehovah
with
his
harsh
and
great
and
strong
sword
Will
turn
his
attention
to
Leviathan
the
gliding
serpent
To
Leviathan
the
twisting
serpent
And
he
will
kill
the
monster
that
is
in
the
sea

2
In
that
day
sing
to
her
A
vineyard
of
foaming
wine

3
I
Jehovah
am
safeguarding
her
Every
moment
I
water
her
I
safeguard
her
night
and
day
So
that
no
one
may
harm
her

4
There
is
no
wrath
in
me
Who
will
confront
me
with
thornbushes
and
weeds
in
the
battle
I
will
trample
them
and
set
them
on
fire
all
together

5
Otherwise
let
him
hold
fast
to
my
stronghold
Let
him
make
peace
with
me
Peace
let
him
make
with
me

6
In
the
coming
days
Jacob
will
take
root
Israel
will
blossom
and
sprout
And
they
will
fill
the
land
with
produce

7
Must
he
be
struck
with
the
stroke
of
the
one
striking
him
Or
must
he
be
killed
as
with
the
slaughter
of
his
slain

8
With
a
startling
cry
you
will
contend
with
her
when
sending
her
away
He
will
expel
her
with
his
fierce
blast
in
the
day
of
the
east
wind

9
So
in
this
way
the
error
of
Jacob
will
be
atoned
for
And
this
will
be
the
full
fruitage
when
his
sin
is
taken
away
He
will
make
all
the
stones
of
the
altarLike
chalkstones
that
have
been
pulverized
And
no
sacred
poles
or
incense
stands
will
be
left
10
For
the
fortified
city
will
be
deserted
The
pastures
will
be
forsaken
and
abandoned
like
a
wilderness
There
the
calf
will
graze
and
lie
downAnd
will
consume
her
branches
11
When
her
twigs
have
dried
up
Women
will
come
and
break
them
off
Making
fires
with
them
For
this
people
is
without
understanding
That
is
why
their
Maker
will
show
them
no
mercy
And
the
One
who
formed
them
will
show
them
no
favor
12
In
that
day
Jehovah
will
beat
out
the
fruit
from
the
flowing
stream
of
the
River
to
the
Wadi
of
Egypt
and
you
will
be
gathered
up
one
after
the
other
O
people
of
Israel
13
In
that
day
a
great
horn
will
be
blown
and
those
who
are
perishing
in
the
land
of
Assyria
and
those
dispersed
in
the
land
of
Egypt
will
come
and
bow
down
to
Jehovah
in
the
holy
mountain
in
Jerusalem
1
Woe
to
the
showy
crown
of
the
drunkards
of
EphraimAnd
the
fading
blossom
of
its
glorious
beauty
Which
is
on
the
head
of
the
fertile
valley
of
those
overcome
with
wine

2
Look
Jehovah
has
someone
strong
and
mighty
Like
a
thundering
hailstorm
a
destructive
windstorm
Like
a
thunderstorm
of
powerful
floodwaters
He
will
forcefully
hurl
it
down
to
the
earth

3
The
showy
crowns
of
the
drunkards
of
EphraimWill
be
trampled
underfoot

4
And
the
fading
flower
of
its
glorious
beauty
Which
is
on
the
head
of
the
fertile
valley
Will
become
like
the
early
fig
before
summer
When
someone
sees
it
he
swallows
it
as
soon
as
it
is
in
his
hand
5
In
that
day
Jehovah
of
armies
will
become
a
glorious
crown
and
a
beautiful
garland
to
those
left
of
his
people
6
And
he
will
become
a
spirit
of
justice
to
the
one
who
sits
in
judgment
and
a
source
of
mightiness
to
those
who
repel
the
attack
at
the
gate

7
And
these
also
go
astray
because
of
wine
Their
alcoholic
beverages
make
them
stagger
Priest
and
prophet
go
astray
because
of
alcohol
The
wine
confuses
them
And
they
stagger
from
their
alcohol
Their
vision
makes
them
go
astray
And
they
stumble
in
judgment

8
For
their
tables
are
full
of
filthy
vomit—There
is
no
place
without
it

9
To
whom
will
one
impart
knowledge
And
to
whom
will
one
explain
the
message
To
those
who
have
just
been
weaned
from
milk
Those
just
taken
away
from
the
breasts
10
For
it
is
command
after
command
command
after
command
Line
by
line
line
by
line
A
little
here
a
little
there
11
So
by
means
of
those
with
stammering
speech
and
a
foreign
language
he
will
speak
to
this
people
12
He
once
told
them
This
is
the
resting-place
Let
the
weary
one
rest
this
is
the
place
of
refreshment

but
they
refused
to
listen
13
So
to
them
the
word
of
Jehovah
will
be
Command
after
command
command
after
command
Line
by
line
line
by
line
A
little
here
a
little
there

So
that
when
they
walk
They
will
stumble
and
fall
backwardAnd
be
broken
and
ensnared
and
caught
14
So
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
you
boasters
You
rulers
of
this
people
in
Jerusalem
15
For
you
men
say
We
have
made
a
covenant
with
Death
And
with
the
Grave
we
have
made
an
agreement
When
the
raging
flash
flood
passes
through
It
will
not
reach
us
For
we
have
made
a
lie
our
refugeAnd
we
have
hidden
ourselves
in
falsehood
16
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
laying
as
a
foundation
in
Zion
a
tested
stone
The
precious
cornerstone
of
a
sure
foundation
No
one
exercising
faith
will
panic
17
And
I
will
make
justice
the
measuring
lineAnd
righteousness
the
leveling
tool
The
hail
will
sweep
away
the
refuge
of
lies
And
the
waters
will
flood
out
the
hiding
place
18
Your
covenant
with
Death
will
be
dissolved
And
your
agreement
with
the
Grave
will
not
stand
When
the
raging
flash
flood
passes
through
You
will
be
crushed
by
it
19
As
often
as
it
passes
through
It
will
sweep
you
away
For
it
will
pass
through
morning
after
morning
During
the
day
and
during
the
night
Only
terror
will
make
them
understand
what
was
heard
20
For
the
bed
is
too
short
to
stretch
out
on
And
the
woven
sheet
is
too
narrow
to
wrap
up
in
21
For
Jehovah
will
rise
up
as
at
Mount
Perazim
He
will
rouse
himself
as
in
the
valley
near
Gibeon
That
he
may
do
his
deed—his
strange
deed—And
that
he
may
carry
out
his
work—his
unusual
work
22
Now
do
not
scoff
So
that
your
bonds
may
not
be
further
tightened
For
I
have
heard
from
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
That
an
extermination
has
been
determined
for
all
the
land
23
Give
ear
and
listen
to
my
voice
Pay
attention
and
listen
to
what
I
say
24
Does
the
plower
keep
plowing
all
day
before
he
sows
seed
Does
he
continually
break
up
and
harrow
his
ground
25
When
he
has
smoothed
out
its
surface
Does
he
not
then
scatter
black
cumin
and
sow
cumin
And
does
he
not
plant
wheat
millet
and
barley
in
their
placesAnd
spelt
around
the
edges
26
For
He
teaches
him
the
right
way
His
God
instructs
him
27
For
black
cumin
is
not
crushed
with
a
threshing
sledge
And
a
wagon
wheel
is
not
driven
over
cumin
Rather
black
cumin
is
beaten
out
with
a
rod
And
cumin
with
a
staff
28
Does
a
person
crush
grain
for
bread
No
he
does
not
thresh
it
incessantly
And
when
he
drives
the
roller
of
his
wagon
over
it
with
his
horses
He
does
not
crush
it
29
This
also
comes
from
Jehovah
of
armies
Whose
counsel
is
wonderfulAnd
whose
achievements
are
great
1
Woe
to
Ariel
Ariel
the
city
where
David
encamped
Continue
year
after
year
Let
the
cycle
of
festivals
continue

2
But
I
will
bring
distress
on
Ariel
And
there
will
be
mourning
and
lamentation
And
she
will
become
to
me
like
an
altar
hearth
of
God

3
I
will
encamp
on
all
sides
against
you
And
I
will
besiege
you
with
a
palisadeAnd
raise
up
siegeworks
against
you

4
You
will
be
brought
low
From
the
ground
you
will
speak
And
what
you
say
will
be
muffled
by
dust
Your
voice
will
come
from
the
groundLike
the
voice
of
a
spirit
medium
And
your
words
will
chirp
from
the
dust

5
The
crowd
of
your
enemies
will
be
like
fine
powder
The
crowd
of
the
tyrants
just
like
the
blowing
chaff
And
it
will
happen
in
an
instant
suddenly

6
Jehovah
of
armies
will
give
you
his
attentionWith
thunder
and
earthquake
and
a
great
noise
With
storm
wind
and
tempest
and
the
flames
of
a
consuming
fire

7
Then
the
crowd
of
all
the
nations
waging
war
against
Ariel—All
those
waging
war
against
her
The
siege
towers
against
her
And
those
bringing
distress
on
her—Will
become
like
a
dream
a
vision
of
the
night

8
Yes
it
will
be
just
as
when
someone
hungry
dreams
that
he
is
eating
But
he
wakes
up
hungry
And
as
when
someone
thirsty
dreams
that
he
is
drinking
But
he
wakes
up
tired
and
thirsty
So
it
will
happen
with
the
crowd
of
all
the
nationsThat
wage
war
against
Mount
Zion

9
Be
stunned
and
amazed
Blind
yourselves
and
be
blinded
They
are
drunk
but
not
with
wine
They
are
staggering
but
not
from
alcohol
10
For
Jehovah
has
poured
a
spirit
of
deep
sleep
on
you
He
has
closed
your
eyes
the
prophets
And
he
has
covered
your
heads
the
visionaries
11
Every
vision
becomes
for
you
like
the
words
of
a
sealed
book
When
they
give
it
to
someone
who
can
read
saying
Read
this
out
loud
please

he
will
say
I
cannot
for
it
is
sealed
up
12
And
when
they
give
the
book
to
someone
who
cannot
read
saying
Read
this
please

he
will
say
I
cannot
read
at
all
13
Jehovah
says
This
people
approaches
me
with
their
mouthAnd
they
honor
me
with
their
lips
But
their
heart
is
far
removed
from
me
And
their
fear
of
me
is
based
on
commands
of
men
that
they
have
been
taught
14
Therefore
I
am
the
One
who
will
again
do
wonderful
things
with
this
people
With
wonder
upon
wonder
And
the
wisdom
of
their
wise
men
will
perish
And
the
understanding
of
their
discreet
men
will
be
hidden
15
Woe
to
those
who
go
to
great
lengths
to
conceal
their
plans
from
Jehovah
Their
deeds
are
done
in
a
dark
place
While
they
say
Who
sees
us
Who
knows
about
us
16
How
you
twist
things
Should
the
potter
be
regarded
the
same
as
the
clay
Should
what
is
made
say
about
its
maker
He
did
not
make
me
And
does
what
is
formed
say
about
its
former
He
shows
no
understanding
17
In
just
a
short
time
Lebanon
will
be
turned
into
an
orchard
And
the
orchard
will
be
regarded
as
a
forest
18
In
that
day
the
deaf
will
hear
the
words
of
the
book
And
out
of
the
gloom
and
darkness
the
eyes
of
the
blind
will
see
19
The
meek
will
rejoice
greatly
in
Jehovah
And
the
poor
among
men
will
be
joyful
in
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
20
For
the
tyrant
will
be
no
more
The
boaster
will
come
to
his
finish
And
all
those
keeping
alert
to
do
harm
will
be
destroyed
21
Those
who
with
a
false
word
make
others
guilty
Who
lay
traps
for
the
defender
in
the
city
gate
And
who
with
empty
arguments
deny
justice
to
the
righteous
one
22
So
this
is
what
Jehovah
who
redeemed
Abraham
says
to
the
house
of
Jacob
Jacob
will
no
longer
be
ashamed
And
no
more
will
his
face
grow
pale
23
For
when
he
sees
his
children
Who
are
the
work
of
my
hands
in
his
midst
They
will
sanctify
my
name
Yes
they
will
sanctify
the
Holy
One
of
Jacob
And
they
will
stand
in
awe
of
the
God
of
Israel
24
Those
who
are
wayward
in
spirit
will
acquire
understanding
And
those
who
complain
will
accept
instruction
1
Woe
to
the
stubborn
sons

declares
Jehovah
Who
carry
out
plans
that
are
not
mine
Who
make
alliances
but
not
by
my
spirit
In
order
to
add
sin
to
sin

2
They
go
down
to
Egypt
without
consulting
me
To
take
shelter
under
Pharaohs
protectionAnd
to
take
refuge
in
the
shadow
of
Egypt

3
But
the
protection
of
Pharaoh
will
become
for
you
a
reason
for
shame
And
refuge
in
Egypts
shadow
a
cause
for
humiliation

4
For
his
princes
are
in
Zoan
And
his
envoys
have
reached
Hanes

5
They
will
all
be
put
to
shameBy
a
people
who
can
bring
no
benefit
to
them
Who
offer
no
help
and
no
benefit
Only
shame
and
disgrace
6
A
pronouncement
against
the
beasts
of
the
south
Through
the
land
of
distress
and
hardship
Of
the
lion
the
roaring
lion
Of
the
viper
and
the
flying
fiery
snake
They
carry
their
wealth
on
the
backs
of
donkeysAnd
their
supplies
on
the
humps
of
camels
But
these
things
will
not
benefit
the
people

7
For
Egypts
help
is
completely
useless
So
I
have
called
this
one
Rahab
who
sits
still

8
Now
go
write
it
on
a
tablet
in
their
presence
And
inscribe
it
in
a
book
So
that
it
may
serve
for
a
future
dayAs
a
permanent
witness

9
For
they
are
a
rebellious
people
deceitful
sons
Sons
who
are
unwilling
to
hear
the
law
of
Jehovah
10
They
say
to
the
seers
Do
not
see

And
to
the
visionaries
Do
not
tell
us
truthful
visions
Tell
us
flattering
things
envision
deceptive
illusions
11
Turn
aside
from
the
way
deviate
from
the
path
Quit
putting
before
us
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
12
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
says
Since
you
reject
this
wordAnd
you
trust
in
fraud
and
deceitAnd
you
rely
on
these
13
So
this
error
will
be
for
you
like
a
broken
wall
Like
a
bulging
high
wall
ready
to
fall
It
will
crash
suddenly
in
an
instant
14
It
will
be
broken
like
a
large
potters
jar
So
completely
smashed
that
no
fragment
among
its
pieces
will
be
leftTo
rake
the
fire
from
the
fireplaceOr
to
scoop
water
from
a
puddle
15
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
says
By
returning
to
me
and
resting
you
will
be
saved
Your
strength
will
be
in
keeping
calm
and
showing
trust
But
you
were
unwilling
16
Instead
you
said
No
we
will
flee
on
horses
So
flee
you
willAnd
on
swift
horses
we
will
ride
So
those
pursuing
you
will
be
swift
17
A
thousand
will
tremble
at
the
threat
of
one
At
the
threat
of
five
you
will
fleeUntil
what
is
left
of
you
is
like
a
mast
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
Like
a
signal
pole
on
a
hill
18
But
Jehovah
is
waiting
patiently
to
show
you
favor
And
he
will
rise
up
to
show
you
mercy
For
Jehovah
is
a
God
of
justice
Happy
are
all
those
keeping
in
expectation
of
him
19
When
the
people
dwell
in
Zion
in
Jerusalem
you
will
by
no
means
weep
He
will
surely
show
you
favor
at
the
sound
of
your
cry
for
help
he
will
answer
you
as
soon
as
he
hears
it
20
Though
Jehovah
will
give
you
bread
in
the
form
of
distress
and
water
in
the
form
of
oppression
your
Grand
Instructor
will
no
longer
hide
himself
and
you
will
see
your
Grand
Instructor
with
your
own
eyes
21
And
your
own
ears
will
hear
a
word
behind
you
saying
This
is
the
way
Walk
in
it

in
case
you
should
go
to
the
right
or
in
case
you
should
go
to
the
left
22
And
you
will
defile
the
silver
overlay
of
your
graven
images
and
the
golden
plating
of
your
metal
statues
You
will
cast
them
away
like
a
menstrual
cloth
and
say
to
them
Be
gone
23
And
he
will
give
the
rain
for
the
seed
you
sow
in
the
ground
and
the
bread
that
the
ground
produces
will
be
abundant
and
rich
In
that
day
your
livestock
will
graze
in
spacious
pastures
24
And
the
cattle
and
the
donkeys
that
work
the
ground
will
eat
fodder
seasoned
with
sorrel
which
was
winnowed
with
the
shovel
and
the
pitchfork
25
And
on
every
tall
mountain
and
on
every
high
hill
will
be
streams
and
watercourses
in
the
day
of
the
great
slaughter
when
the
towers
fall
26
And
the
light
of
the
full
moon
will
become
like
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
light
of
the
sun
will
become
seven
times
stronger
like
the
light
of
seven
days
in
the
day
that
Jehovah
binds
up
the
breakdown
of
his
people
and
heals
the
severe
wound
from
the
blow
he
inflicted
27
Look
The
name
of
Jehovah
is
coming
from
far
away
Burning
with
his
anger
and
with
heavy
clouds
His
lips
are
full
of
indignation
And
his
tongue
is
like
a
consuming
fire
28
His
spirit
is
like
a
flooding
torrent
that
reaches
clear
to
the
neck
To
shake
the
nations
in
a
sieve
of
destruction
And
the
peoples
will
have
a
bridle
in
their
jaws
that
leads
them
astray
29
But
your
song
will
be
like
the
one
sung
in
the
nightWhen
you
prepare
for
a
festival
And
your
heart
will
rejoice
like
oneWho
walks
with
a
fluteOn
his
way
to
the
mountain
of
Jehovah
to
the
Rock
of
Israel
30
Jehovah
will
make
his
majestic
voice
heardAnd
reveal
his
arm
as
it
descends
in
the
heat
of
anger
With
the
flame
of
a
consuming
fire
A
cloudburst
and
a
thunderstorm
and
hailstones
31
For
because
of
the
voice
of
Jehovah
Assyria
will
be
struck
with
terror
He
will
strike
it
with
a
rod
32
And
every
swing
of
his
rod
of
punishmentThat
Jehovah
will
bring
down
on
AssyriaWill
be
accompanied
by
tambourines
and
harpsAs
he
brandishes
his
arm
against
them
in
battle
33
For
his
Topheth
is
already
prepared
It
is
also
made
ready
for
the
king
He
has
made
the
woodpile
deep
and
wide
With
an
abundance
of
fire
and
wood
The
breath
of
Jehovah
like
a
torrent
of
sulfur
Will
set
fire
to
it
1
Woe
to
those
who
go
down
to
Egypt
for
assistance
Who
rely
on
horses
Who
trust
in
war
chariots
because
they
are
numerous
And
in
warhorses
because
they
are
mighty
But
they
do
not
look
to
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
And
they
do
not
search
for
Jehovah

2
But
he
is
also
wise
and
will
bring
calamity
And
he
will
not
take
back
his
words
He
will
rise
up
against
the
house
of
evildoersAnd
against
those
who
help
wrongdoers

3
The
Egyptians
though
are
mere
men
and
not
God
Their
horses
are
flesh
and
not
spirit
When
Jehovah
stretches
out
his
hand
Whoever
offers
help
will
stumbleAnd
whoever
is
helped
will
fall
They
will
all
perish
at
the
same
time

4
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
has
said
to
me
Just
as
the
lion
growls
a
strong
young
lion
over
its
prey
When
a
whole
group
of
shepherds
is
called
together
against
it
And
it
is
not
terrified
by
their
voiceOr
daunted
by
their
commotion
So
will
Jehovah
of
armies
come
down
to
wage
warOver
Mount
Zion
and
over
her
hill

5
Like
swooping
birds
so
Jehovah
of
armies
will
defend
Jerusalem
He
will
defend
her
and
save
her
He
will
spare
her
and
rescue
her
6
Return
to
the
One
against
whom
you
have
blatantly
revolted
O
people
of
Israel
7
For
in
that
day
each
one
will
reject
his
worthless
gods
of
silver
and
his
valueless
gods
of
gold
which
your
own
hands
sinfully
made

8
And
the
Assyrian
will
fall
by
the
sword
not
of
a
man
And
a
sword
not
of
a
human
will
devour
him
He
will
flee
because
of
the
sword
And
his
young
men
will
be
put
to
forced
labor

9
His
crag
will
pass
away
because
of
sheer
fright
And
his
princes
will
be
terrified
because
of
the
signal
pole

declares
Jehovah
Whose
light
is
in
Zion
and
whose
furnace
is
in
Jerusalem
1
Look
A
king
will
reign
for
righteousness
And
princes
will
rule
for
justice

2
And
each
one
will
be
like
a
hiding
place
from
the
wind
A
place
of
concealment
from
the
rainstorm
Like
streams
of
water
in
a
waterless
land
Like
the
shadow
of
a
massive
crag
in
a
parched
land

3
Then
the
eyes
of
those
seeing
will
no
longer
be
pasted
shut
And
the
ears
of
those
hearing
will
pay
attention

4
The
heart
of
those
who
are
impetuous
will
ponder
over
knowledge
And
the
stammering
tongue
will
speak
fluently
and
clearly

5
The
senseless
one
will
no
longer
be
called
generous
And
the
unprincipled
man
will
not
be
called
noble
6
For
the
senseless
one
will
speak
nonsense
And
his
heart
will
devise
harmful
things
To
promote
apostasy
and
to
speak
what
is
wayward
against
Jehovah
To
cause
the
hungry
one
to
go
unfedAnd
to
deprive
the
thirsty
one
of
something
to
drink

7
The
devices
of
the
unprincipled
man
are
bad
He
promotes
shameful
conductTo
ruin
the
afflicted
one
with
lies
Even
when
the
poor
speaks
what
is
right

8
But
the
generous
one
has
generous
intentions
And
in
generous
endeavors
he
perseveres

9
You
complacent
women
get
up
and
listen
to
my
voice
You
carefree
daughters
pay
attention
to
what
I
say
10
In
a
little
over
a
year
you
who
are
carefree
will
shudder
Because
no
fruit
will
have
been
gathered
when
the
grape
harvest
ends
11
Tremble
you
complacent
women
Shudder
you
who
are
carefree
Strip
yourselves
bare
And
put
sackcloth
around
your
hips
12
Beat
your
breasts
in
lamentationOver
the
desirable
fields
and
the
fruitful
vine
13
For
the
ground
of
my
people
will
be
covered
with
thorns
and
briars
They
will
cover
all
the
houses
of
rejoicing
Yes
the
city
of
exultation
14
For
the
fortified
tower
has
been
forsaken
The
noisy
city
has
been
abandoned
Ophel
and
the
watchtower
have
become
a
permanent
wasteland
A
delight
for
wild
donkeys
A
pasture
for
the
flocks
15
Until
the
spirit
is
poured
out
on
us
from
above
And
the
wilderness
becomes
an
orchard
And
the
orchard
is
regarded
as
a
forest
16
Then
justice
will
reside
in
the
wilderness
And
righteousness
will
dwell
in
the
orchard
17
The
result
of
true
righteousness
will
be
peace
And
the
fruitage
of
true
righteousness
will
be
lasting
tranquillity
and
security
18
My
people
will
dwell
in
a
peaceful
abiding
place
In
secure
dwellings
and
in
tranquil
resting-places
19
But
the
hail
will
flatten
the
forest
And
the
city
will
be
completely
leveled
20
Happy
are
you
who
sow
seed
alongside
all
waters
Who
send
out
the
bull
and
the
donkey
1
Woe
to
you
you
destroyer
who
has
not
been
destroyed
You
betrayer
who
has
not
been
betrayed
When
you
finish
destroying
you
will
be
destroyed
When
you
finish
betraying
you
will
be
betrayed

2
O
Jehovah
show
us
favor
Our
hope
is
in
you
Become
our
arm
every
morning
Yes
our
salvation
in
the
time
of
distress

3
At
the
sound
of
turmoil
peoples
flee
When
you
rise
up
nations
scatter

4
As
the
voracious
locusts
gather
so
your
spoil
will
be
gathered
People
will
rush
on
it
like
swarms
of
locusts

5
Jehovah
will
be
exalted
For
he
resides
in
the
heights
above
He
will
fill
Zion
with
justice
and
righteousness

6
He
is
the
stability
of
your
times
An
abundance
of
salvation
wisdom
knowledge
and
the
fear
of
Jehovah—This
is
his
treasure

7
Look
Their
heroes
cry
out
in
the
street
The
messengers
of
peace
weep
bitterly

8
The
highways
are
deserted
There
is
no
one
traveling
on
the
pathways
He
has
broken
the
covenant
He
has
rejected
the
cities
He
shows
no
regard
for
mortal
man

9
The
land
mourns
and
withers
away
Lebanon
is
ashamed
it
has
decayed
Sharon
has
become
like
the
desert
And
Bashan
and
Carmel
shake
off
their
leaves
10
Now
I
will
rise
up

says
Jehovah
Now
I
will
exalt
myself
Now
I
will
magnify
myself
11
You
conceive
dried
grass
and
give
birth
to
stubble
Your
own
spirit
will
consume
you
like
a
fire
12
And
peoples
will
become
as
the
burnings
of
lime
As
thorns
cut
down
they
will
be
set
ablaze
with
fire
13
You
who
are
far
away
listen
to
what
I
will
do
And
you
who
are
nearby
acknowledge
my
might
14
The
sinners
in
Zion
are
in
dread
Trembling
has
seized
the
apostates
Who
of
us
can
live
where
there
is
a
consuming
fire
Who
of
us
can
live
with
unquenchable
flames
15
The
one
who
walks
in
continual
righteousness
Who
speaks
what
is
upright
Who
rejects
dishonest
fraudulent
gain
Whose
hands
refuse
a
bribe
rather
than
grabbing
it
Who
closes
his
ear
to
talk
of
bloodshed
And
who
shuts
his
eyes
to
avoid
seeing
what
is
bad16
—He
will
reside
in
the
heights
His
secure
refuge
will
be
in
rocky
strongholds
His
bread
will
be
provided
And
his
water
supply
will
never
fail
17
Your
eyes
will
behold
a
king
in
his
splendor
They
will
see
a
land
far
away
18
In
your
heart
you
will
recall
the
terror
Where
is
the
secretary
Where
is
the
one
who
weighed
out
the
tribute
Where
is
the
one
who
counted
the
towers
19
You
will
no
more
see
the
insolent
people
A
people
whose
language
is
too
obscure
to
comprehend
Whose
stammering
tongue
you
cannot
understand
20
Behold
Zion
the
city
of
our
festivals
Your
eyes
will
see
Jerusalem
as
a
tranquil
dwelling
place
A
tent
that
will
not
be
moved
Never
will
its
tent
pins
be
pulled
out
And
none
of
its
ropes
will
be
torn
apart
21
But
there
the
Majestic
One
Jehovah
Will
be
for
us
a
region
of
rivers
of
wide
canals
Where
no
galley
fleet
will
goAnd
no
majestic
ships
will
pass
by
22
For
Jehovah
is
our
Judge
Jehovah
is
our
Lawgiver
Jehovah
is
our
King
He
is
the
One
who
will
save
us
23
Your
ropes
will
hang
loose
They
cannot
hold
up
the
mast
nor
spread
the
sail
At
that
time
an
abundance
of
spoil
will
be
divided
up
Even
the
lame
will
take
much
plunder
24
And
no
resident
will
say
I
am
sick
The
people
dwelling
in
the
land
will
be
pardoned
for
their
error
1
Come
close
to
hear
you
nations
And
pay
attention
you
peoples
Let
the
earth
and
that
which
fills
it
listen
The
land
and
all
its
produce

2
For
Jehovahs
indignation
is
against
all
the
nations
And
his
wrath
is
against
all
their
army
He
will
devote
them
to
destruction
He
will
give
them
to
the
slaughter

3
Their
slain
will
be
thrown
out
And
the
stench
of
their
carcasses
will
ascend
The
mountains
will
melt
because
of
their
blood

4
All
the
army
of
the
heavens
will
rot
away
And
the
heavens
will
be
rolled
up
like
a
scroll
All
their
army
will
wither
away
As
a
withered
leaf
falls
from
the
vineAnd
a
shriveled
fig
from
the
fig
tree

5
For
in
the
heavens
my
sword
will
be
drenched
It
will
descend
on
Edom
in
judgment
On
the
people
whom
I
devoted
to
destruction

6
Jehovah
has
a
sword
it
will
be
covered
with
blood
It
will
be
covered
with
the
fat
With
the
blood
of
young
rams
and
goats
With
the
kidney
fat
of
rams
For
Jehovah
has
a
sacrifice
in
Bozrah
A
great
slaughter
in
the
land
of
Edom

7
The
wild
bulls
will
go
down
with
them
The
young
bulls
with
the
powerful
ones
Their
land
will
be
drenched
in
blood
And
their
dust
will
be
soaked
with
fat

8
For
Jehovah
has
a
day
of
vengeance
A
year
of
retribution
for
the
legal
case
over
Zion

9
Her
streams
will
be
changed
into
pitch
And
her
dust
into
sulfur
And
her
land
will
become
like
burning
pitch
10
By
night
or
by
day
it
will
not
be
extinguished
Its
smoke
will
keep
ascending
forever
From
generation
to
generation
she
will
remain
devastated
No
one
will
pass
through
her
forever
and
ever
11
The
pelican
and
the
porcupine
will
possess
her
And
long-eared
owls
and
ravens
will
reside
in
her
He
will
stretch
out
over
her
the
measuring
line
of
emptinessAnd
the
plumb
line
of
desolation
12
None
of
her
nobles
will
be
called
to
the
kingship
And
all
her
princes
will
come
to
nothing
13
Thorns
will
grow
in
her
fortified
towers
Nettles
and
thorny
weeds
in
her
fortresses
She
will
become
a
lair
of
jackals
An
enclosure
for
ostriches
14
Desert
creatures
will
meet
up
with
howling
animals
And
the
wild
goat
will
call
to
its
companion
Yes
there
the
nightjar
will
settle
and
find
a
place
of
rest
15
There
the
arrow
snake
will
make
its
nest
and
lay
eggs
And
it
will
hatch
them
and
gather
them
in
its
shadow
Yes
there
the
kites
will
gather
each
one
with
her
mate
16
Search
in
the
book
of
Jehovah
and
read
it
out
loud
Not
one
of
them
will
be
missing
None
of
them
will
be
lacking
a
mate
For
it
is
the
mouth
of
Jehovah
that
has
given
the
order
And
it
is
his
spirit
that
has
gathered
them
together
17
He
is
the
One
who
has
cast
the
lot
for
them
And
his
own
hand
has
measured
out
their
assigned
place
They
will
possess
it
for
all
time
They
will
reside
in
it
throughout
all
generations
1
The
wilderness
and
the
parched
land
will
exult
And
the
desert
plain
will
be
joyful
and
blossom
as
the
saffron

2
Without
fail
it
will
blossom
It
will
rejoice
and
shout
for
joy
The
glory
of
Lebanon
will
be
given
to
it
The
splendor
of
Carmel
and
of
Sharon
They
will
see
the
glory
of
Jehovah
the
splendor
of
our
God

3
Strengthen
the
weak
hands
And
make
firm
the
knees
that
are
shaking

4
Say
to
those
who
are
anxious
at
heart
Be
strong
Do
not
be
afraid
Look
Your
own
God
will
come
with
vengeance
God
will
come
with
retribution
He
will
come
and
save
you

5
At
that
time
the
eyes
of
the
blind
will
be
opened
And
the
ears
of
the
deaf
will
be
unstopped

6
At
that
time
the
lame
will
leap
like
the
deer
And
the
tongue
of
the
speechless
will
shout
for
joy
For
waters
will
burst
forth
in
the
wilderness
And
streams
in
the
desert
plain

7
The
heat-parched
ground
will
become
a
reedy
pool
And
the
thirsty
ground
springs
of
water
In
the
lairs
where
jackals
rested
There
will
be
green
grass
and
reeds
and
papyrus

8
And
a
highway
will
be
there
Yes
a
way
called
the
Way
of
Holiness
The
unclean
one
will
not
travel
on
it
It
is
reserved
for
the
one
walking
on
the
way
No
one
foolish
will
stray
onto
it

9
No
lion
will
be
there
And
no
vicious
wild
beasts
will
come
on
it
They
will
not
be
found
there
Only
the
repurchased
ones
will
walk
there
10
Those
redeemed
by
Jehovah
will
return
and
come
to
Zion
with
a
joyful
cry
Unending
joy
will
crown
their
heads
Exultation
and
rejoicing
will
be
theirs
And
grief
and
sighing
will
flee
away
1
In
the
14th
year
of
King
Hezekiah
Sennacherib
the
king
of
Assyria
came
up
against
all
the
fortified
cities
of
Judah
and
captured
them
2
The
king
of
Assyria
then
sent
the
Rabshakeh
with
a
vast
army
from
Lachish
to
King
Hezekiah
in
Jerusalem
They
took
up
a
position
by
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
which
is
at
the
highway
of
the
laundrymans
field
3
Then
Eliakim
son
of
Hilkiah
who
was
in
charge
of
the
household
Shebna
the
secretary
and
Joah
son
of
Asaph
the
recorder
came
out
to
him
4
So
the
Rabshakeh
said
to
them
Please
say
to
Hezekiah
This
is
what
the
great
king
the
king
of
Assyria
says
What
is
the
basis
for
your
confidence
5
You
are
saying
I
have
a
strategy
and
the
power
to
wage
war

but
these
are
empty
words
In
whom
have
you
put
trust
so
that
you
dare
to
rebel
against
me
6
Look
You
trust
in
the
support
of
this
crushed
reed
Egypt
which
if
a
man
should
lean
on
it
would
enter
into
his
palm
and
pierce
it
That
is
the
way
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
is
to
all
those
who
trust
in
him
7
And
if
you
should
say
to
me
We
trust
in
Jehovah
our
God

is
he
not
the
one
whose
high
places
and
altars
Hezekiah
has
removed
while
he
says
to
Judah
and
Jerusalem
You
should
bow
down
before
this
altar
8
So
now
make
this
wager
please
with
my
lord
the
king
of
Assyria
I
will
give
you
2000
horses
if
you
are
able
to
find
enough
riders
for
them
9
How
then
could
you
drive
back
even
one
governor
who
is
the
least
of
my
lords
servants
while
you
put
your
trust
in
Egypt
for
chariots
and
for
horsemen
10
Now
is
it
without
authorization
from
Jehovah
that
I
have
come
up
against
this
land
to
destroy
it
Jehovah
himself
said
to
me
Go
up
against
this
land
and
destroy
it
11
At
this
Eliakim
and
Shebna
and
Joah
said
to
the
Rabshakeh
Speak
to
your
servants
please
in
the
Aramaic
language
for
we
can
understand
it
do
not
speak
to
us
in
the
language
of
the
Jews
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
on
the
wall
12
But
the
Rabshakeh
said
Is
it
just
to
your
lord
and
to
you
that
my
lord
sent
me
to
speak
these
words
Is
it
not
also
to
the
men
who
sit
on
the
wall
those
who
will
eat
their
own
excrement
and
drink
their
own
urine
along
with
you
13
Then
the
Rabshakeh
stood
and
called
out
loudly
in
the
language
of
the
Jews
saying
Hear
the
word
of
the
great
king
the
king
of
Assyria
14
This
is
what
the
king
says
Do
not
let
Hezekiah
deceive
you
for
he
is
not
able
to
rescue
you
15
And
do
not
let
Hezekiah
cause
you
to
trust
in
Jehovah
by
saying
Jehovah
will
surely
rescue
us
and
this
city
will
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria
16
Do
not
listen
to
Hezekiah
for
this
is
what
the
king
of
Assyria
says
Make
peace
with
me
and
surrender
and
each
of
you
will
eat
from
his
own
vine
and
from
his
own
fig
tree
and
will
drink
the
water
of
his
own
cistern
17
until
I
come
and
take
you
to
a
land
like
your
own
land
a
land
of
grain
and
new
wine
a
land
of
bread
and
vineyards
18
Do
not
let
Hezekiah
mislead
you
by
saying
Jehovah
will
rescue
us
Have
any
of
the
gods
of
the
nations
rescued
their
land
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria
19
Where
are
the
gods
of
Hamath
and
Arpad
Where
are
the
gods
of
Sepharvaim
And
have
they
rescued
Samaria
out
of
my
hand
20
Who
among
all
the
gods
of
these
lands
have
rescued
their
land
out
of
my
hand
so
that
Jehovah
should
rescue
Jerusalem
out
of
my
hand
21
But
they
kept
silent
and
did
not
say
a
word
to
him
in
reply
for
the
order
of
the
king
was
You
must
not
answer
him
22
But
Eliakim
son
of
Hilkiah
who
was
in
charge
of
the
household
Shebna
the
secretary
and
Joah
son
of
Asaph
the
recorder
came
to
Hezekiah
with
their
garments
ripped
apart
and
told
him
the
words
of
the
Rabshakeh
1
As
soon
as
King
Hezekiah
heard
this
he
ripped
his
garments
apart
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth
and
went
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
2
Then
he
sent
Eliakim
who
was
in
charge
of
the
household
Shebna
the
secretary
and
the
elders
of
the
priests
covered
with
sackcloth
to
the
prophet
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
3
They
said
to
him
This
is
what
Hezekiah
says
This
day
is
a
day
of
distress
of
rebuke
and
of
disgrace
for
the
children
are
ready
to
be
born
but
there
is
no
strength
to
give
birth
4
Perhaps
Jehovah
your
God
will
hear
the
words
of
the
Rabshakeh
whom
the
king
of
Assyria
his
lord
sent
to
taunt
the
living
God
and
he
will
call
him
to
account
for
the
words
that
Jehovah
your
God
has
heard
So
offer
up
a
prayer
in
behalf
of
the
remnant
who
have
survived
5
So
the
servants
of
King
Hezekiah
went
in
to
Isaiah
6
and
Isaiah
said
to
them
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
your
lord
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Do
not
be
afraid
because
of
the
words
that
you
heard
the
words
with
which
the
attendants
of
the
king
of
Assyria
blasphemed
me
7
Here
I
am
putting
a
thought
in
his
mind
and
he
will
hear
a
report
and
return
to
his
own
land
and
I
will
make
him
fall
by
the
sword
in
his
own
land
8
After
the
Rabshakeh
heard
that
the
king
of
Assyria
had
pulled
away
from
Lachish
he
returned
to
him
and
found
him
fighting
against
Libnah
9
Now
the
king
heard
it
said
about
King
Tirhakah
of
Ethiopia
He
has
come
out
to
fight
against
you
When
he
heard
this
he
sent
messengers
again
to
Hezekiah
saying
10
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
Do
not
let
your
God
in
whom
you
trust
deceive
you
by
saying
Jerusalem
will
not
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria
11
Look
You
have
heard
what
the
kings
of
Assyria
did
to
all
the
lands
by
devoting
them
to
destruction
Will
you
alone
be
rescued
12
Did
the
gods
of
the
nations
that
my
forefathers
destroyed
rescue
them
Where
are
Gozan
Haran
Rezeph
and
the
people
of
Eden
who
were
in
Tel-assar
13
Where
is
the
king
of
Hamath
the
king
of
Arpad
and
the
king
of
the
cities
of
Sepharvaim
and
of
Hena
and
of
Ivvah
14
Hezekiah
took
the
letters
out
of
the
hand
of
the
messengers
and
read
them
Hezekiah
then
went
up
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
spread
them
out
before
Jehovah
15
And
Hezekiah
began
to
pray
to
Jehovah
and
say
16
O
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
sitting
enthroned
above
the
cherubs
you
alone
are
the
true
God
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
You
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
17
Incline
your
ear
O
Jehovah
and
hear
Open
your
eyes
O
Jehovah
and
see
Hear
all
the
words
that
Sennacherib
has
sent
to
taunt
the
living
God
18
It
is
a
fact
O
Jehovah
that
the
kings
of
Assyria
have
devastated
all
the
lands
as
well
as
their
own
land
19
And
they
have
thrown
their
gods
into
the
fire
because
they
were
not
gods
but
the
work
of
human
hands
wood
and
stone
That
is
why
they
could
destroy
them
20
But
now
O
Jehovah
our
God
save
us
out
of
his
hand
so
that
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
may
know
that
you
alone
are
God
O
Jehovah
21
Isaiah
son
of
Amoz
then
sent
this
message
to
Hezekiah
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Because
you
prayed
to
me
concerning
King
Sennacherib
of
Assyria
22
this
is
the
word
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
against
him
The
virgin
daughter
of
Zion
despises
you
she
scoffs
at
you
The
daughter
of
Jerusalem
shakes
her
head
at
you
23
Whom
have
you
taunted
and
blasphemed
Against
whom
have
you
raised
your
voiceAnd
lifted
your
arrogant
eyes
It
is
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
24
Through
your
servants
you
have
taunted
Jehovah
and
said
With
the
multitude
of
my
war
chariotsI
will
ascend
the
heights
of
mountains
The
remotest
parts
of
Lebanon
I
will
cut
down
its
lofty
cedars
its
choice
juniper
trees
I
will
enter
its
highest
retreats
its
densest
forests
25
I
will
dig
wells
and
drink
waters
I
will
dry
up
the
streams
of
Egypt
with
the
soles
of
my
feet
26
Have
you
not
heard
From
long
ago
it
was
determined
From
days
gone
by
I
have
prepared
it
Now
I
will
bring
it
about
You
will
turn
fortified
cities
into
desolate
piles
of
ruins
27
Their
inhabitants
will
be
helpless
They
will
be
terrified
and
put
to
shame
They
will
become
as
vegetation
of
the
field
and
green
grass
As
grass
of
the
roofs
that
is
scorched
by
the
east
wind
28
But
I
well
know
when
you
sit
when
you
go
out
when
you
come
in
And
when
you
are
enraged
against
me
29
Because
your
rage
against
me
and
your
roaring
have
reached
my
ears
So
I
will
put
my
hook
in
your
nose
and
my
bridle
between
your
lips
And
I
will
lead
you
back
the
way
you
came
30
And
this
will
be
the
sign
for
you
This
year
you
will
eat
what
grows
on
its
own
and
in
the
second
year
you
will
eat
grain
that
sprouts
from
that
but
in
the
third
year
you
will
sow
seed
and
reap
and
you
will
plant
vineyards
and
eat
their
fruitage
31
Those
of
the
house
of
Judah
who
escape
those
who
are
left
will
take
root
downward
and
produce
fruit
upward
32
For
a
remnant
will
go
out
of
Jerusalem
and
survivors
from
Mount
Zion
The
zeal
of
Jehovah
of
armies
will
do
this
33
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
about
the
king
of
Assyria
He
will
not
come
into
this
cityOr
shoot
an
arrow
thereOr
confront
it
with
a
shieldOr
cast
up
a
siege
rampart
against
it
34
By
the
way
he
came
he
will
return
He
will
not
come
into
this
city

declares
Jehovah
35
I
will
defend
this
city
and
save
it
for
my
own
sakeAnd
for
the
sake
of
my
servant
David
36
And
the
angel
of
Jehovah
went
out
and
struck
down
185000
men
in
the
camp
of
the
Assyrians
When
people
rose
up
early
in
the
morning
they
saw
all
the
dead
bodies
37
So
King
Sennacherib
of
Assyria
departed
and
returned
to
Nineveh
and
stayed
there
38
And
as
he
was
bowing
down
at
the
house
of
his
god
Nisroch
his
own
sons
Adrammelech
and
Sharezer
struck
him
down
with
the
sword
and
then
escaped
to
the
land
of
Ararat
And
his
son
Esar-haddon
became
king
in
his
place
1
In
those
days
Hezekiah
became
sick
and
was
at
the
point
of
death
The
prophet
Isaiah
the
son
of
Amoz
came
and
said
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Give
instructions
to
your
household
for
you
will
die
you
will
not
recover
2
At
that
Hezekiah
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
began
to
pray
to
Jehovah
3
I
beg
you
O
Jehovah
remember
please
how
I
have
walked
before
you
faithfully
and
with
a
complete
heart
and
I
have
done
what
was
good
in
your
eyes
And
Hezekiah
began
to
weep
profusely
4
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Isaiah
saying
5
Go
back
and
say
to
Hezekiah
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
David
your
forefather
says
I
have
heard
your
prayer
I
have
seen
your
tears
Here
I
am
adding
15
years
to
your
life
6
and
I
will
rescue
you
and
this
city
out
of
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Assyria
and
I
will
defend
this
city
7
This
is
the
sign
from
Jehovah
to
show
you
that
Jehovah
will
carry
out
the
word
that
he
has
spoken
8
Here
I
will
make
the
declining
shadow
of
the
sun
on
the
stairway
of
Ahaz
go
back
ten
steps
So
the
sun
went
back
ten
steps
on
the
stairway
that
it
had
already
descended
9
A
writing
of
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
when
he
became
sick
and
recovered
from
his
sickness
10
I
said
In
the
middle
of
my
lifeI
must
go
into
the
gates
of
the
Grave
I
will
be
deprived
of
my
remaining
years
11
I
said
I
will
not
see
Jah
Jah
in
the
land
of
the
living
I
will
look
no
more
on
mankindWhen
I
am
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
where
everything
ceases
12
My
own
dwelling
has
been
pulled
out
and
removed
from
meLike
the
tent
of
a
shepherd
I
have
rolled
up
my
life
like
a
loom
worker
He
cuts
me
off
like
the
threads
of
the
warp
From
daylight
to
nightfall
you
keep
bringing
me
to
an
end
13
I
calm
myself
until
the
morning
Like
a
lion
he
keeps
breaking
all
my
bones
From
daylight
to
nightfall
you
keep
bringing
me
to
an
end
14
Like
the
swift
or
the
thrush
so
I
keep
chirping
I
keep
cooing
like
the
dove
My
eyes
look
wearily
to
the
height
O
Jehovah
I
am
in
great
distress
Be
my
support
15
What
can
I
say
He
has
spoken
to
me
and
acted
I
will
walk
humbly
all
my
yearsBecause
of
my
bitter
distress
16
O
Jehovah
by
these
things
every
man
lives
And
in
them
is
the
life
of
my
spirit
You
will
restore
me
to
health
and
preserve
me
alive
17
Look
Instead
of
peace
I
had
great
bitterness
But
in
your
fondness
for
me
You
preserved
me
from
the
pit
of
destruction
You
have
thrown
all
my
sins
behind
your
back
18
For
the
Grave
cannot
glorify
you
Death
cannot
praise
you
Those
who
go
down
into
the
pit
cannot
hope
for
your
faithfulness
19
The
living
the
living
can
praise
you
Just
as
I
can
this
day
A
father
can
give
his
sons
knowledge
about
your
faithfulness
20
O
Jehovah
save
me
And
we
will
play
my
songs
on
stringed
instrumentsAll
the
days
of
our
life
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
21
Isaiah
then
said
Bring
a
cake
of
pressed
dried
figs
and
apply
it
to
the
boil
so
that
he
may
recover
22
Hezekiah
had
asked
What
is
the
sign
that
I
will
go
up
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
1
At
that
time
the
king
of
Babylon
Merodach-baladan
son
of
Baladan
sent
letters
and
a
gift
to
Hezekiah
for
he
had
heard
that
he
had
been
sick
and
had
recovered
2
Hezekiah
gladly
welcomed
them
and
showed
them
his
treasure-house—the
silver
the
gold
the
balsam
oil
and
other
precious
oil
his
whole
armory
and
everything
that
was
to
be
found
in
his
treasuries
There
was
nothing
that
Hezekiah
did
not
show
them
in
his
own
house
and
in
all
his
dominion
3
After
that
Isaiah
the
prophet
came
in
to
King
Hezekiah
and
asked
him
What
did
these
men
say
and
where
did
they
come
from
So
Hezekiah
said
They
came
from
a
distant
land
from
Babylon
4
Next
he
asked
What
did
they
see
in
your
house
Hezekiah
replied
They
saw
everything
in
my
house
There
was
nothing
that
I
did
not
show
them
in
my
treasuries
5
Isaiah
now
said
to
Hezekiah
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
of
armies
6
Look
Days
are
coming
and
all
that
is
in
your
house
and
all
that
your
forefathers
have
stored
up
to
this
day
will
be
carried
off
to
Babylon
Nothing
will
be
left

says
Jehovah
7
And
some
of
your
own
sons
to
whom
you
will
become
father
will
be
taken
and
will
become
court
officials
in
the
palace
of
the
king
of
Babylon
8
At
that
Hezekiah
said
to
Isaiah
The
word
of
Jehovah
that
you
have
spoken
is
good
Then
he
added
Because
there
will
be
peace
and
stability
during
my
lifetime
1
Comfort
comfort
my
people

says
your
God

2
Speak
to
the
heart
of
Jerusalem
And
proclaim
to
her
that
her
compulsory
service
has
been
fulfilled
That
her
guilt
has
been
paid
off
From
the
hand
of
Jehovah
she
has
received
a
full
amount
for
all
her
sins

3
A
voice
of
one
calling
out
in
the
wilderness
Clear
up
the
way
of
Jehovah
Make
a
straight
highway
through
the
desert
for
our
God

4
Let
every
valley
be
raised
up
And
every
mountain
and
hill
be
made
low
The
rough
ground
must
become
level
And
the
rugged
ground
a
valley
plain

5
The
glory
of
Jehovah
will
be
revealed
And
all
flesh
will
see
it
together
For
the
mouth
of
Jehovah
has
spoken

6
Listen
Someone
is
saying
Call
out
Another
asks
What
should
I
call
out
All
flesh
is
green
grass
All
their
loyal
love
is
like
the
blossom
of
the
field

7
The
green
grass
dries
up
The
blossom
withers
Because
the
breath
of
Jehovah
blows
upon
it
Surely
the
people
are
but
green
grass

8
The
green
grass
dries
up
The
blossom
withers
But
the
word
of
our
God
endures
forever

9
Go
up
onto
a
high
mountain
You
woman
bringing
good
news
for
Zion
Raise
your
voice
with
power
You
woman
bringing
good
news
for
Jerusalem
Raise
it
do
not
be
afraid
Announce
to
the
cities
of
Judah
Here
is
your
God
10
Look
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
will
come
with
power
And
his
arm
will
rule
for
him
Look
His
reward
is
with
him
And
the
wage
he
pays
is
before
him
11
Like
a
shepherd
he
will
care
for
his
flock
With
his
arm
he
will
gather
together
the
lambs
And
in
his
bosom
he
will
carry
them
He
will
gently
lead
those
nursing
their
young
12
Who
has
measured
the
waters
in
the
hollow
of
his
handAnd
taken
the
measurements
of
the
heavens
with
a
span
of
his
hand
Who
has
gathered
in
a
measure
the
dust
of
the
earthOr
weighed
the
mountains
in
the
balancesAnd
the
hills
in
the
scales
13
Who
has
taken
the
measurements
of
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
And
who
can
instruct
him
as
his
adviser
14
With
whom
did
he
consult
to
gain
understanding
Or
who
teaches
him
in
the
path
of
justice
Or
teaches
him
knowledge
Or
shows
him
the
way
of
true
understanding
15
Look
The
nations
are
like
a
drop
from
a
bucket
And
as
the
film
of
dust
on
the
scales
they
are
regarded
Look
He
lifts
up
the
islands
like
fine
dust
16
Even
Lebanon
is
not
sufficient
to
keep
a
fire
burning
And
its
wild
animals
are
not
sufficient
for
a
burnt
offering
17
All
the
nations
are
as
something
nonexistent
in
front
of
him
He
regards
them
as
nothing
as
an
unreality
18
To
whom
can
you
compare
God
What
likeness
can
you
put
next
to
him
19
The
craftsman
casts
an
idol
The
metalworker
overlays
it
with
gold
And
he
forges
silver
chains
20
He
chooses
a
tree
for
his
contribution
A
tree
that
will
not
rot
He
searches
for
a
skilled
craftsmanTo
prepare
a
carved
image
that
will
not
topple
over
21
Do
you
not
know
Have
you
not
heard
Has
it
not
been
told
to
you
from
the
beginning
Have
you
not
understood
from
the
foundations
of
the
earth
22
There
is
One
who
dwells
above
the
circle
of
the
earth
And
its
inhabitants
are
like
grasshoppers
He
is
stretching
out
the
heavens
like
a
fine
gauze
And
he
spreads
them
out
like
a
tent
to
dwell
in
23
He
reduces
high
officials
to
nothingAnd
makes
the
judges
of
the
earth
an
unreality
24
They
are
hardly
planted
They
are
hardly
sown
Their
stem
has
hardly
taken
root
in
the
earth
And
they
are
blown
on
and
dry
up
And
the
wind
carries
them
away
like
stubble
25
To
whom
can
you
liken
me
to
make
me
his
equal
says
the
Holy
One
26
Lift
up
your
eyes
to
heaven
and
see
Who
has
created
these
things
It
is
the
One
who
brings
out
their
army
by
number
He
calls
them
all
by
name
Because
of
his
vast
dynamic
energy
and
his
awe-inspiring
power
Not
one
of
them
is
missing
27
Why
do
you
say
O
Jacob
and
why
do
you
declare
O
Israel
My
way
is
hidden
from
Jehovah
And
I
receive
no
justice
from
God
28
Do
you
not
know
Have
you
not
heard
Jehovah
the
Creator
of
the
ends
of
the
earth
is
a
God
for
all
eternity
He
never
tires
out
or
grows
weary
His
understanding
is
unsearchable
29
He
gives
power
to
the
tired
oneAnd
full
might
to
those
lacking
strength
30
Boys
will
tire
out
and
grow
weary
And
young
men
will
stumble
and
fall
31
But
those
hoping
in
Jehovah
will
regain
power
They
will
soar
on
wings
like
eagles
They
will
run
and
not
grow
weary
They
will
walk
and
not
tire
out
1
Listen
to
me
in
silence
you
islands
Let
the
nations
regain
their
strength
Let
them
approach
then
let
them
speak
Let
us
come
together
for
judgment

2
Who
has
raised
up
someone
from
the
sunrise
Calling
him
in
righteousness
to
His
feet
To
hand
over
nations
to
himAnd
to
make
him
subdue
kings
Who
reduces
them
to
dust
before
his
sword
Like
windblown
stubble
before
his
bow

3
He
pursues
them
passing
along
unhinderedOver
paths
that
his
feet
have
not
traveled

4
Who
has
acted
and
done
this
Summoning
the
generations
from
the
beginning
I
Jehovah
am
the
First
One
And
with
the
last
ones
I
am
the
same

5
The
islands
have
seen
it
and
have
become
afraid
The
ends
of
the
earth
began
to
tremble
They
draw
near
and
come
forward

6
Each
one
helps
his
companionAnd
says
to
his
brother
Be
strong

7
So
the
craftsman
strengthens
the
metalworker
The
one
who
flattens
with
the
forge
hammerStrengthens
the
one
hammering
at
the
anvil
He
says
about
the
soldering
It
is
good
Then
it
is
fastened
with
nails
so
that
it
will
not
topple
over

8
But
you
O
Israel
are
my
servant
You
O
Jacob
whom
I
have
chosen
The
offspring
of
Abraham
my
friend
9
You
whom
I
took
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
And
you
whom
I
called
from
its
most
distant
parts
I
said
to
you
You
are
my
servant
I
have
chosen
you
I
have
not
rejected
you
10
Do
not
be
afraid
for
I
am
with
you
Do
not
be
anxious
for
I
am
your
God
I
will
fortify
you
yes
I
will
help
you
I
will
really
hold
on
to
you
with
my
right
hand
of
righteousness
11
Look
All
those
getting
enraged
against
you
will
be
put
to
shame
and
humiliated
Those
who
fight
with
you
will
be
brought
to
nothing
and
perish
12
You
will
search
for
men
who
struggle
with
you
but
you
will
not
find
them
The
men
at
war
with
you
will
become
as
something
nonexistent
as
nothing
at
all
13
For
I
Jehovah
your
God
am
grasping
your
right
hand
The
One
saying
to
you
Do
not
be
afraid
I
will
help
you
14
Do
not
be
afraid
you
worm
Jacob
You
men
of
Israel
I
will
help
you

declares
Jehovah
your
Repurchaser
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
15
Look
I
have
made
you
a
threshing
sledge
A
new
threshing
instrument
with
double-edged
teeth
You
will
tread
down
the
mountains
and
crush
themAnd
make
the
hills
like
chaff
16
You
will
winnow
them
And
the
wind
will
carry
them
away
A
windstorm
will
scatter
them
You
will
be
joyful
in
Jehovah
And
you
will
boast
in
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
17
The
needy
and
the
poor
are
seeking
water
but
there
is
none
Their
tongue
is
dry
from
thirst
I
Jehovah
will
answer
them
I
the
God
of
Israel
will
not
abandon
them
18
I
will
make
rivers
flow
on
the
bare
hillsAnd
springs
in
the
valley
plains
I
will
turn
the
wilderness
into
a
reedy
pool
of
waterAnd
the
waterless
land
into
springs
of
water
19
In
the
desert
I
will
plant
the
cedar
tree
The
acacia
and
the
myrtle
and
the
pine
tree
In
the
desert
plain
I
will
plant
the
juniper
tree
Together
with
the
ash
and
the
cypress
tree
20
So
that
all
people
may
see
and
knowAnd
pay
attention
and
understandThat
the
hand
of
Jehovah
has
done
this
And
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
has
created
it
21
Present
your
case

says
Jehovah
Produce
your
arguments

says
the
King
of
Jacob
22
Produce
evidence
and
tell
us
the
things
that
will
happen
Do
tell
us
about
the
former
things
So
that
we
may
reflect
on
them
and
know
their
outcome
Or
declare
to
us
the
things
that
are
coming
23
Tell
us
what
will
happen
in
the
future
So
that
we
may
know
that
you
are
gods
Yes
do
something
good
or
bad
So
that
we
may
be
amazed
when
we
see
it
24
Look
You
are
something
nonexistent
And
your
achievement
is
nothing
Anyone
who
chooses
you
is
detestable
25
I
have
raised
up
someone
from
the
north
and
he
will
come
One
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
who
will
call
on
my
name
He
will
trample
rulers
as
if
they
were
clay
Like
a
potter
who
treads
moist
clay
26
Who
told
about
this
from
the
beginning
so
that
we
could
know
Or
from
times
past
so
that
we
could
say
He
is
right
Indeed
no
one
announced
it
No
one
declared
it
No
one
heard
anything
from
you
27
I
was
the
first
to
say
to
Zion
Look
Here
they
are
And
to
Jerusalem
I
will
send
a
bearer
of
good
news
28
But
I
kept
looking
and
there
was
no
one
There
was
not
one
among
them
to
give
advice
And
I
kept
asking
them
to
reply
29
Look
All
of
them
are
a
delusion
Their
works
are
nothing
Their
metal
images
are
wind
and
unreality
1
Look
My
servant
whom
I
support
My
chosen
one
whom
I
have
approved
I
have
put
my
spirit
in
him
He
will
bring
justice
to
the
nations

2
He
will
not
cry
out
or
raise
his
voice
And
he
will
not
make
his
voice
heard
in
the
street

3
No
crushed
reed
will
he
break
And
no
smoldering
wick
will
he
extinguish
In
faithfulness
he
will
bring
justice

4
He
will
not
grow
dim
or
be
crushed
until
he
establishes
justice
in
the
earth
And
the
islands
keep
waiting
for
his
law

5
This
is
what
the
true
God
Jehovah
says
The
Creator
of
the
heavens
and
the
Grand
One
who
stretched
them
out
The
One
who
spread
out
the
earth
and
its
produce
The
One
who
gives
breath
to
the
people
on
itAnd
spirit
to
those
who
walk
on
it

6
I
Jehovah
have
called
you
in
righteousness
I
have
taken
hold
of
your
hand
I
will
safeguard
you
and
give
you
as
a
covenant
for
the
peopleAnd
as
a
light
of
the
nations
7
For
you
to
open
the
blind
eyes
To
bring
the
prisoner
out
of
the
dungeonAnd
those
sitting
in
darkness
out
of
the
prison

8
I
am
Jehovah
That
is
my
name
I
give
my
glory
to
no
one
else
Nor
my
praise
to
graven
images

9
See
the
first
things
have
come
to
pass
Now
I
am
declaring
new
things
Before
they
spring
up
I
tell
you
about
them
10
Sing
to
Jehovah
a
new
song
His
praise
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
You
who
go
down
to
the
sea
and
all
that
fills
it
You
islands
and
their
inhabitants
11
Let
the
wilderness
and
its
cities
raise
their
voice
The
settlements
where
Kedar
dwells
Let
the
inhabitants
of
the
crag
shout
joyfully
Let
them
cry
out
from
the
top
of
the
mountains
12
Let
them
attribute
glory
to
JehovahAnd
declare
his
praise
in
the
islands
13
Jehovah
will
go
out
like
a
mighty
man
He
will
awaken
his
zeal
like
a
warrior
He
will
shout
yes
he
will
let
out
a
war
cry
He
will
show
himself
mightier
than
his
enemies
14
I
have
kept
quiet
for
a
long
time
I
remained
silent
and
restrained
myself
Like
a
woman
giving
birth
I
will
groan
pant
and
gasp
all
at
once
15
I
will
devastate
mountains
and
hillsAnd
dry
up
all
their
vegetation
I
will
turn
rivers
into
islandsAnd
dry
up
reedy
pools
of
water
16
I
will
lead
the
blind
in
a
way
that
they
do
not
knowAnd
cause
them
to
tread
on
unfamiliar
paths
I
will
turn
the
darkness
before
them
into
lightAnd
turn
the
rugged
terrain
into
level
land
This
is
what
I
will
do
for
them
and
I
will
not
abandon
them
17
They
will
be
turned
back
and
will
be
utterly
put
to
shame
Those
who
trust
in
carved
images
Those
who
say
to
metal
statues
You
are
our
gods
18
Listen
you
who
are
deaf
Look
and
see
you
who
are
blind
19
Who
is
blind
except
my
servant
So
deaf
as
the
messenger
I
send
Who
is
so
blind
as
the
one
rewarded
So
blind
as
the
servant
of
Jehovah
20
You
see
many
things
but
you
do
not
keep
watch
You
open
your
ears
but
you
do
not
listen
21
For
the
sake
of
his
righteousness
Jehovah
has
taken
pleasure
in
magnifying
the
law
and
making
it
glorious
22
But
this
is
a
people
plundered
and
pillaged
All
of
them
are
trapped
in
the
holes
and
hidden
in
the
prisons
They
have
been
plundered
with
no
one
to
rescue
them
And
pillaged
with
no
one
to
say
Bring
them
back
23
Who
among
you
will
hear
this
Who
will
pay
attention
and
listen
for
the
time
to
come
24
Who
has
given
Jacob
for
pillageAnd
Israel
to
the
plunderers
Is
it
not
Jehovah
the
One
against
whom
we
sinned
In
His
ways
they
refused
to
walk
And
His
law
they
would
not
obey
25
So
He
kept
pouring
out
on
him
wrath
His
anger
and
the
fury
of
war
It
consumed
everything
around
him
but
he
paid
no
attention
It
blazed
up
against
him
but
he
would
not
take
it
to
heart
1
Now
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Your
Creator
O
Jacob
the
One
who
formed
you
O
Israel
Do
not
be
afraid
for
I
have
repurchased
you
I
have
called
you
by
your
name
You
belong
to
me

2
When
you
pass
through
the
waters
I
will
be
with
you
And
through
the
rivers
they
will
not
flood
over
you
When
you
walk
through
the
fire
you
will
not
be
scorched
Nor
will
the
flame
singe
you

3
For
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
The
Holy
One
of
Israel
your
Savior
I
have
given
Egypt
as
a
ransom
for
you
Ethiopia
and
Seba
in
exchange
for
you

4
For
you
became
precious
in
my
eyes
You
were
honored
and
I
have
loved
you
So
I
will
give
people
in
place
of
youAnd
nations
in
exchange
for
your
life

5
Do
not
be
afraid
for
I
am
with
you
I
will
bring
your
offspring
from
the
eastAnd
gather
you
together
from
the
west

6
I
will
say
to
the
north
Give
them
up
And
to
the
south
Do
not
hold
them
back
Bring
my
sons
from
afar
and
my
daughters
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
7
Everyone
who
is
called
by
my
nameAnd
whom
I
created
for
my
own
glory
Whom
I
have
formed
and
made

8
Bring
out
a
people
who
are
blind
though
they
have
eyes
And
who
are
deaf
though
they
have
ears

9
Let
all
the
nations
assemble
in
one
place
And
let
the
peoples
be
gathered
together
Who
among
them
can
tell
this
Or
can
they
cause
us
to
hear
the
first
things
Let
them
present
their
witnesses
to
prove
themselves
right
Or
let
them
hear
and
say
It
is
the
truth
10
You
are
my
witnesses

declares
Jehovah
Yes
my
servant
whom
I
have
chosen
So
that
you
may
know
and
have
faith
in
meAnd
understand
that
I
am
the
same
One
Before
me
no
God
was
formed
And
after
me
there
has
been
none
11
I—I
am
Jehovah
and
besides
me
there
is
no
savior
12
I
am
the
One
who
declared
and
saved
and
made
knownWhen
there
was
no
foreign
god
among
you
So
you
are
my
witnesses

declares
Jehovah
and
I
am
God
13
Also
I
am
always
the
same
One
And
no
one
can
snatch
anything
out
of
my
hand
When
I
act
who
can
prevent
it
14
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
your
Repurchaser
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
For
your
sakes
I
will
send
to
Babylon
and
bring
down
all
the
bars
of
the
gates
And
the
Chaldeans
in
their
ships
will
cry
out
in
distress
15
I
am
Jehovah
your
Holy
One
the
Creator
of
Israel
your
King
16
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
The
One
making
a
way
through
the
seaAnd
a
path
even
through
turbulent
waters
17
The
One
who
draws
out
the
war
chariot
and
the
horse
The
army
together
with
the
mighty
warriors
They
will
lie
down
and
not
get
up
They
will
be
extinguished
snuffed
out
like
a
burning
wick
18
Do
not
remember
the
former
things
And
do
not
dwell
on
the
past
19
Look
I
am
doing
something
new
Even
now
it
is
springing
up
Do
you
not
recognize
it
I
will
make
a
way
through
the
wildernessAnd
rivers
through
the
desert
20
The
wild
beast
of
the
field
will
honor
me
The
jackals
and
the
ostriches
For
I
provide
water
in
the
wilderness
Rivers
in
the
desert
For
my
people
my
chosen
one
to
drink
21
The
people
whom
I
formed
for
myselfSo
that
they
might
declare
my
praise
22
But
you
have
not
called
on
me
O
Jacob
Because
you
grew
weary
of
me
O
Israel
23
You
have
not
brought
me
sheep
for
your
whole
burnt
offeringsOr
glorified
me
with
your
sacrifices
I
have
not
compelled
you
to
bring
me
a
gift
Nor
have
I
made
you
weary
by
demanding
frankincense
24
You
did
not
buy
me
sweet
cane
with
your
money
And
with
the
fat
of
your
sacrifices
you
did
not
satisfy
me
Instead
you
have
burdened
me
with
your
sinsAnd
made
me
weary
with
your
errors
25
I
I
am
the
One
who
is
blotting
out
your
transgressions
for
my
own
sake
And
I
will
not
remember
your
sins
26
Remind
me
let
us
bring
our
case
against
each
other
Tell
your
side
of
it
to
prove
you
are
in
the
right
27
Your
first
forefather
sinned
And
your
own
spokesmen
have
rebelled
against
me
28
So
I
will
profane
the
princes
of
the
holy
place
And
I
will
give
Jacob
over
to
destructionAnd
subject
Israel
to
insulting
words
1
Now
listen
O
Jacob
my
servant
And
you
O
Israel
whom
I
have
chosen

2
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Your
Maker
and
the
One
who
formed
you
Who
has
helped
you
from
the
womb
Do
not
be
afraid
my
servant
Jacob
And
you
Jeshurun
whom
I
have
chosen

3
For
I
will
pour
out
water
on
the
thirsty
oneAnd
flowing
streams
on
the
dry
ground
I
will
pour
out
my
spirit
on
your
offspringAnd
my
blessing
on
your
descendants

4
And
they
will
spring
up
as
among
the
green
grass
Like
poplars
by
the
streams
of
water

5
One
will
say
I
belong
to
Jehovah
Another
will
call
himself
by
the
name
of
Jacob
And
yet
another
will
write
on
his
hand
Belonging
to
Jehovah
And
he
will
adopt
the
name
of
Israel

6
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
The
King
of
Israel
and
his
Repurchaser
Jehovah
of
armies
I
am
the
first
and
I
am
the
last
There
is
no
God
but
me

7
Who
is
there
like
me
Let
him
call
out
and
tell
it
and
prove
it
to
me
From
the
time
I
established
the
people
of
long
ago
Let
them
tell
both
the
things
to
comeAnd
what
will
yet
happen

8
Do
not
be
in
dread
And
do
not
become
paralyzed
with
fear
Have
I
not
told
each
of
you
beforehand
and
declared
it
You
are
my
witnesses
Is
there
any
God
but
me
No
there
is
no
other
Rock
I
know
of
none

9
All
who
form
carved
images
amount
to
nothing
And
their
cherished
objects
will
be
of
no
benefit
As
their
witnesses
they
see
nothing
and
know
nothing
So
those
who
made
them
will
be
put
to
shame
10
Who
would
form
a
god
or
cast
a
metal
imageThat
can
bring
no
benefit
11
Look
All
his
associates
will
be
put
to
shame
The
craftsmen
are
mere
humans
Let
them
all
assemble
and
take
their
stand
They
will
be
terrified
and
be
put
to
shame
together
12
The
metalsmith
works
the
iron
over
the
coals
with
his
tool
He
forms
it
with
hammers
Working
it
with
his
powerful
arm
Then
he
grows
hungry
and
his
strength
fails
He
drinks
no
water
and
grows
tired
13
The
wood-carver
stretches
the
measuring
line
tracing
out
the
pattern
with
red
chalk
He
works
it
with
a
wood
scraper
and
traces
it
with
a
compass
He
patterns
it
after
a
man
With
the
beauty
of
a
man
To
sit
in
a
house
14
There
is
one
whose
work
is
to
cut
down
cedars
He
selects
a
certain
type
of
tree
an
oak
And
he
lets
it
grow
strong
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
He
plants
a
laurel
tree
and
the
rain
makes
it
grow
15
Then
it
becomes
fuel
for
a
man
to
make
fires
He
takes
part
of
it
to
warm
himself
He
builds
a
fire
and
bakes
bread
But
he
also
makes
a
god
and
worships
it
He
makes
it
into
a
carved
image
and
he
bows
down
before
it
16
Half
of
it
he
burns
up
in
a
fire
With
that
half
he
roasts
the
meat
that
he
eats
and
he
is
satisfied
He
also
warms
himself
and
says
Ah
I
am
warm
as
I
watch
the
fire
17
But
the
rest
of
it
he
makes
into
a
god
into
his
carved
image
He
bows
down
to
it
and
worships
it
He
prays
to
it
and
says
Save
me
for
you
are
my
god
18
They
know
nothing
they
understand
nothing
Because
their
eyes
are
sealed
shut
and
they
cannot
see
And
their
heart
has
no
insight
19
No
one
reflects
in
his
heartOr
has
knowledge
or
understanding
saying
Half
of
it
I
burned
up
in
a
fire
And
on
its
coals
I
baked
bread
and
roasted
meat
to
eat
Should
I
then
make
the
rest
of
it
into
a
detestable
thing
Should
I
worship
a
block
of
wood
from
a
tree
20
He
feeds
on
ashes
His
own
deluded
heart
has
led
him
astray
He
cannot
save
himself
nor
does
he
say
Is
there
not
a
lie
in
my
right
hand
21
Remember
these
things
O
Jacob
and
you
O
Israel
For
you
are
my
servant
I
formed
you
and
you
are
my
servant
O
Israel
I
will
not
forget
you
22
I
will
blot
out
your
transgressions
as
with
a
cloudAnd
your
sins
as
with
a
thick
cloud
Return
to
me
for
I
will
repurchase
you
23
Shout
joyfully
you
heavens
For
Jehovah
has
acted
Shout
in
triumph
you
depths
of
the
earth
Shout
for
joy
you
mountains
You
forest
and
all
your
trees
For
Jehovah
has
repurchased
Jacob
And
on
Israel
he
displays
his
splendor
24
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
your
Repurchaser
Who
formed
you
since
you
were
in
the
womb
I
am
Jehovah
who
made
everything
I
stretched
out
the
heavens
by
myself
And
I
spread
out
the
earth
Who
was
with
me
25
I
am
frustrating
the
signs
of
the
empty
talkers
And
I
am
the
One
who
makes
diviners
act
like
fools
The
One
confounding
the
wise
menAnd
turning
their
knowledge
into
foolishness
26
The
One
making
the
word
of
his
servant
come
trueAnd
completely
fulfilling
the
predictions
of
his
messengers
The
One
saying
of
Jerusalem
She
will
be
inhabited

And
of
the
cities
of
Judah
They
will
be
rebuilt
And
I
will
restore
her
ruins
27
The
One
saying
to
the
deep
waters
Be
evaporated
And
I
will
dry
up
all
your
rivers
28
The
One
saying
of
Cyrus
He
is
my
shepherd
And
he
will
completely
carry
out
all
my
will
The
One
saying
of
Jerusalem
She
will
be
rebuilt

And
of
the
temple
Your
foundation
will
be
laid
1
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
to
his
anointed
one
to
Cyrus
Whose
right
hand
I
have
taken
hold
ofTo
subdue
nations
before
him
To
disarm
kings
To
open
before
him
the
double
doors
So
that
the
gates
will
not
be
shut

2
Before
you
I
will
go
And
the
hills
I
will
level
The
copper
doors
I
will
break
in
pieces
And
the
iron
bars
I
will
cut
down

3
I
will
give
you
the
treasures
in
the
darknessAnd
the
hidden
treasures
in
the
concealed
places
So
that
you
may
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
The
God
of
Israel
who
is
calling
you
by
your
name

4
For
the
sake
of
my
servant
Jacob
and
of
Israel
my
chosen
one
I
am
calling
you
by
your
name
I
am
giving
you
a
name
of
honor
although
you
did
not
know
me

5
I
am
Jehovah
and
there
is
no
one
else
There
is
no
God
except
me
I
will
strengthen
you
although
you
did
not
know
me
6
In
order
that
people
may
knowFrom
the
rising
of
the
sun
to
its
settingThat
there
is
none
besides
me
I
am
Jehovah
and
there
is
no
one
else

7
I
form
light
and
create
darkness
I
make
peace
and
create
calamity
I
Jehovah
am
doing
all
these
things

8
You
heavens
rain
down
from
above
Let
the
clouds
pour
down
righteousness
Let
the
earth
open
up
and
be
fruitful
with
salvation
And
let
it
cause
righteousness
to
spring
up
at
the
same
time
I
Jehovah
have
created
it

9
Woe
to
the
one
who
contends
with
his
Maker
For
he
is
just
an
earthenware
fragmentAmong
the
other
earthenware
fragments
lying
on
the
ground
Should
the
clay
say
to
the
Potter
What
are
you
making
Or
should
your
work
say
He
has
no
hands
10
Woe
to
the
one
who
says
to
a
father
What
do
you
become
father
to
And
to
a
woman
What
are
you
giving
birth
to
11
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
the
One
who
formed
him
Would
you
question
me
about
the
things
comingAnd
command
me
about
my
sons
and
the
works
of
my
hands
12
I
made
the
earth
and
created
man
on
it
I
stretched
out
the
heavens
with
my
own
hands
And
I
give
orders
to
all
their
army
13
I
have
raised
up
a
man
in
righteousness
And
I
will
make
all
his
ways
straight
He
is
the
one
who
will
build
my
cityAnd
set
my
exiles
free
without
a
price
or
a
bribe

says
Jehovah
of
armies
14
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
The
profit
of
Egypt
and
the
merchandise
of
Ethiopia
and
the
Sabeans
tall
of
stature
Will
come
over
to
you
and
become
yours
They
will
walk
behind
you
in
chains
They
will
come
over
and
bow
down
to
you
To
you
they
will
say
in
prayer
Surely
God
is
with
you
And
there
is
no
one
else
there
is
no
other
God
15
Truly
you
are
a
God
who
conceals
himself
O
God
of
Israel
the
Savior
16
They
will
all
be
put
to
shame
and
be
humiliated
The
makers
of
idols
will
all
go
off
in
disgrace
17
But
Israel
will
be
saved
by
Jehovah
with
an
everlasting
salvation
You
will
not
be
put
to
shame
or
disgraced
for
all
eternity
18
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
The
Creator
of
the
heavens
the
true
God
The
One
who
formed
the
earth
its
Maker
who
firmly
established
it
Who
did
not
create
it
simply
for
nothing
but
formed
it
to
be
inhabited
I
am
Jehovah
and
there
is
no
one
else
19
I
did
not
speak
in
a
concealed
place
in
a
land
of
darkness
I
did
not
say
to
the
offspring
of
Jacob
Seek
me
simply
for
nothing
I
am
Jehovah
who
speaks
what
is
righteous
and
declares
what
is
upright
20
Gather
together
and
come
Approach
together
you
escapees
from
the
nations
They
know
nothing
those
who
carry
around
carved
imagesAnd
pray
to
a
god
that
cannot
save
them
21
Make
your
report
present
your
case
Let
them
consult
together
in
unity
Who
foretold
this
long
agoAnd
declared
it
from
times
past
Is
it
not
I
Jehovah
There
is
no
other
God
but
me
A
righteous
God
and
a
Savior
there
is
none
besides
me
22
Turn
to
me
and
be
saved
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
For
I
am
God
and
there
is
no
one
else
23
By
myself
I
have
sworn
The
word
has
gone
out
of
my
mouth
in
righteousness
And
it
will
not
return
To
me
every
knee
will
bend
Every
tongue
will
swear
loyalty24
And
say
Surely
in
Jehovah
are
true
righteousness
and
strength
All
those
enraged
against
him
will
come
before
him
in
shame
25
In
Jehovah
all
the
offspring
of
Israel
will
prove
to
be
right
And
in
him
they
will
make
their
boast
1
Bel
bends
down
Nebo
stoops
over
Their
idols
are
loaded
on
animals
on
beasts
of
burden
Like
baggage
that
burdens
the
weary
animals

2
They
stoop
and
bend
down
together
They
cannot
rescue
the
loads
And
they
themselves
go
into
captivity

3
Listen
to
me
O
house
of
Jacob
and
all
you
who
remain
of
the
house
of
Israel
You
whom
I
have
supported
from
birth
and
carried
from
the
womb

4
Until
you
grow
old
I
will
be
the
same
Until
your
hair
is
gray
I
will
keep
bearing
you
As
I
have
done
I
will
carry
you
and
bear
you
and
rescue
you

5
To
whom
will
you
liken
me
or
make
me
equal
or
compare
me
So
that
we
should
resemble
each
other

6
There
are
those
who
lavish
gold
from
their
purse
They
weigh
out
the
silver
on
the
scale
They
hire
a
metalworker
and
he
makes
it
into
a
god
Then
they
prostrate
themselves
yes
they
worship
it

7
They
lift
it
to
their
shoulders
They
carry
it
and
put
it
in
its
place
and
it
just
stands
there
It
does
not
move
from
its
place
They
cry
out
to
it
but
it
does
not
answer
It
cannot
rescue
anyone
from
distress

8
Remember
this
and
take
courage
Take
it
to
heart
you
transgressors

9
Remember
the
former
things
of
long
ago
That
I
am
God
and
there
is
no
other
I
am
God
and
there
is
no
one
like
me
10
From
the
beginning
I
foretell
the
outcome
And
from
long
ago
the
things
that
have
not
yet
been
done
I
say
My
decision
will
stand
And
I
will
do
whatever
I
please
11
I
am
calling
a
bird
of
prey
from
the
sunrise
From
a
distant
land
the
man
to
carry
out
my
decision
I
have
spoken
and
I
will
bring
it
about
I
have
purposed
it
and
I
will
also
carry
it
out
12
Listen
to
me
you
who
are
stubborn
of
heart
You
who
are
far
away
from
righteousness
13
I
have
brought
my
righteousness
near
It
is
not
far
away
And
my
salvation
will
not
delay
I
will
grant
salvation
in
Zion
my
splendor
to
Israel
1
Come
down
and
sit
in
the
dust
O
virgin
daughter
of
Babylon
Sit
down
on
the
ground
where
there
is
no
throne
O
daughter
of
the
Chaldeans
For
never
again
will
people
call
you
delicate
and
pampered

2
Take
a
hand
mill
and
grind
flour
Remove
your
veil
Strip
off
your
skirt
uncover
your
legs
Cross
over
the
rivers

3
Your
nakedness
will
be
uncovered
Your
shame
will
be
exposed
I
will
take
vengeance
and
no
man
will
stand
in
my
way

4
The
One
repurchasing
us—Jehovah
of
armies
is
his
name—Is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel

5
Sit
there
silently
and
go
into
darkness
O
daughter
of
the
Chaldeans
No
more
will
they
call
you
Mistress
of
Kingdoms

6
I
grew
indignant
at
my
people
I
profaned
my
inheritance
And
I
gave
them
into
your
hand
But
you
showed
them
no
mercy
Even
on
the
elderly
you
placed
a
heavy
yoke

7
You
said
I
will
always
be
the
Mistress
forever
You
did
not
take
these
things
to
heart
You
did
not
consider
how
the
matter
would
end

8
Now
hear
this
O
lover
of
pleasure
Who
sits
in
security
who
says
in
her
heart
I
am
the
one
and
there
is
no
one
else
I
will
not
become
a
widow
I
will
never
know
the
loss
of
children

9
But
these
two
things
will
come
upon
you
suddenly
in
one
day
Loss
of
children
and
widowhood
In
full
measure
they
will
come
upon
youBecause
of
your
many
sorceries
and
all
your
powerful
spells
10
You
trusted
in
your
wickedness
You
said
No
one
sees
me
Your
wisdom
and
knowledge
are
what
led
you
astray
And
you
say
in
your
heart
I
am
the
one
and
there
is
no
one
else
11
But
calamity
will
come
upon
you
And
none
of
your
charms
will
stop
it
Adversity
will
befall
you
you
will
not
be
able
to
avert
it
Sudden
ruin
will
come
upon
you
like
you
have
never
known
12
Go
ahead
then
with
your
spells
and
your
many
sorceries
With
which
you
have
toiled
from
your
youth
Perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
benefit
Perhaps
you
may
strike
people
with
awe
13
You
have
grown
weary
with
the
multitude
of
your
advisers
Let
them
stand
up
now
and
save
you
Those
who
worship
the
heavens
who
gaze
at
the
stars
Those
giving
out
knowledge
at
the
new
moonsAbout
the
things
that
will
come
upon
you
14
Look
They
are
like
stubble
A
fire
will
burn
them
up
They
cannot
save
themselves
from
the
power
of
the
flame
These
are
not
charcoals
for
keeping
warm
And
this
is
not
a
fire
to
sit
in
front
of
15
So
your
charmers
will
become
to
you
Those
with
whom
you
toiled
from
your
youth
They
will
wander
each
one
in
his
own
direction
There
will
be
no
one
to
save
you
1
Hear
this
O
house
of
Jacob
You
who
call
yourselves
by
the
name
of
IsraelAnd
who
have
come
from
the
waters
of
Judah
You
who
swear
by
the
name
of
JehovahAnd
who
call
on
the
God
of
Israel
Though
not
in
truth
and
righteousness

2
For
they
call
themselves
after
the
holy
cityAnd
seek
the
support
of
the
God
of
Israel
Whose
name
is
Jehovah
of
armies

3
The
former
things
I
told
you
long
ago
From
my
own
mouth
they
went
out
And
I
made
them
known
Suddenly
I
took
action
and
they
came
about

4
Because
I
knew
how
stubborn
you
are—That
your
neck
is
an
iron
sinew
and
your
forehead
is
copper—
5
I
told
you
long
ago
Before
it
came
about
I
caused
you
to
hear
it
So
that
you
could
not
say
My
idol
did
this
My
carved
image
and
my
metal
image
commanded
this

6
You
have
heard
and
seen
all
of
this
Will
you
not
declare
it
From
now
on
I
am
announcing
new
things
to
you
Guarded
secrets
that
you
have
not
known

7
Only
now
are
they
being
created
and
not
long
ago
Things
that
you
never
heard
before
today
So
that
you
cannot
say
Look
I
already
know
them

8
No
you
have
not
heard
you
have
not
known
And
in
the
past
your
ears
were
not
opened
For
I
know
that
you
are
very
treacherous
And
you
have
been
called
a
transgressor
from
birth

9
But
for
the
sake
of
my
name
I
will
hold
back
my
anger
For
my
own
praise
I
will
restrain
myself
toward
you
And
I
will
not
do
away
with
you
10
Look
I
have
refined
you
but
not
in
the
form
of
silver
I
have
tested
you
in
the
smelting
furnace
of
affliction
11
For
my
own
sake
for
my
own
sake
I
will
act
For
how
could
I
let
myself
be
profaned
I
give
my
glory
to
no
one
else
12
Listen
to
me
O
Jacob
and
Israel
whom
I
have
called
I
am
the
same
One
I
am
the
first
I
am
also
the
last
13
My
own
hand
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
And
my
right
hand
spread
out
the
heavens
When
I
call
to
them
they
stand
up
together
14
Gather
together
all
of
you
and
listen
Who
among
them
has
announced
these
things
Jehovah
has
loved
him
He
will
carry
out
his
delight
against
Babylon
And
his
arm
will
come
against
the
Chaldeans
15
I
myself
have
spoken
and
I
have
called
him
I
have
brought
him
and
his
way
will
be
successful
16
Come
near
to
me
and
hear
this
From
the
very
start
I
have
not
spoken
in
secret
From
the
time
it
happened
I
was
there
And
now
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
has
sent
me
and
his
spirit
17
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
your
Repurchaser
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
I
Jehovah
am
your
God
The
One
teaching
you
to
benefit
yourself
The
One
guiding
you
in
the
way
you
should
walk
18
If
only
you
would
pay
attention
to
my
commandments
Then
your
peace
would
become
just
like
a
riverAnd
your
righteousness
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
19
Your
offspring
would
be
as
many
as
the
sandAnd
your
descendants
as
its
grains
Their
name
would
never
be
cut
off
or
annihilated
from
before
me
20
Go
out
from
Babylon
Flee
from
the
Chaldeans
Announce
it
with
a
joyful
cry
Proclaim
it
Make
it
known
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
Say
Jehovah
has
repurchased
his
servant
Jacob
21
They
did
not
become
thirsty
when
he
led
them
through
devastated
places
He
caused
water
to
flow
out
of
the
rock
for
them
He
split
a
rock
and
made
water
gush
out
22
There
is
no
peace

says
Jehovah
for
the
wicked
1
Listen
to
me
you
islands
And
pay
attention
you
faraway
nations
Jehovah
has
called
me
before
I
was
born
From
the
time
I
was
in
my
mothers
womb
he
has
made
mention
of
my
name

2
He
made
my
mouth
like
a
sharp
sword
He
has
hidden
me
in
the
shadow
of
his
hand
He
made
me
a
polished
arrow
He
concealed
me
in
his
quiver

3
He
said
to
me
You
are
my
servant
O
Israel
Through
whom
I
will
show
my
splendor

4
But
I
said
I
have
toiled
for
nothing
I
used
up
my
strength
for
an
unreality
in
vain
But
surely
my
judgment
is
with
Jehovah
And
my
wages
with
my
God

5
And
now
Jehovah
the
One
who
formed
me
from
the
womb
as
his
servant
Has
said
for
me
to
bring
Jacob
back
to
him
So
that
Israel
may
be
gathered
to
him
I
will
be
glorified
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
And
my
God
will
have
become
my
strength

6
And
he
said
It
is
not
enough
that
you
are
my
servantTo
raise
up
the
tribes
of
JacobAnd
to
bring
back
those
who
were
preserved
of
Israel
I
have
also
given
you
as
a
light
of
nations
So
that
my
salvation
may
reach
the
ends
of
the
earth
7
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
Repurchaser
of
Israel
his
Holy
One
says
to
the
one
who
is
despised
to
the
one
who
is
detested
by
the
nation
to
the
servant
of
rulers
Kings
will
see
and
rise
up
And
princes
will
bow
downBecause
of
Jehovah
who
is
faithful
The
Holy
One
of
Israel
who
has
chosen
you

8
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
In
a
time
of
favor
I
answered
you
And
in
a
day
of
salvation
I
helped
you
I
kept
safeguarding
you
to
give
you
as
a
covenant
for
the
people
To
rehabilitate
the
land
To
cause
them
to
possess
their
desolate
inheritances
9
To
say
to
the
prisoners
Come
out
And
to
those
in
the
darkness
Show
yourselves
By
the
roadways
they
will
feed
Along
all
the
worn
paths
will
be
their
pastures
10
They
will
not
go
hungry
nor
will
they
thirst
Nor
will
scorching
heat
or
the
sun
beat
down
on
them
For
the
One
who
has
mercy
on
them
will
lead
them
And
he
will
guide
them
by
the
springs
of
water
11
I
will
make
all
my
mountains
into
a
road
And
my
highways
will
be
raised
up
12
Look
These
are
coming
from
far
away
And
look
these
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
And
these
from
the
land
of
Sinim
13
Shout
for
joy
you
heavens
and
rejoice
you
earth
Let
the
mountains
become
cheerful
with
a
joyful
cry
For
Jehovah
has
comforted
his
people
And
he
shows
mercy
to
his
own
afflicted
ones
14
But
Zion
kept
saying
Jehovah
has
abandoned
me
and
Jehovah
has
forgotten
me
15
Can
a
woman
forget
her
nursing
childOr
have
no
compassion
for
the
son
of
her
womb
Even
if
these
women
forget
I
would
never
forget
you
16
Look
On
my
palms
I
have
engraved
you
Your
walls
are
always
before
me
17
Your
sons
hurry
back
Those
who
tore
you
down
and
devastated
you
will
depart
from
you
18
Raise
your
eyes
and
look
all
around
They
are
all
gathering
together
They
are
coming
to
you
As
surely
as
I
am
living

declares
Jehovah
You
will
clothe
yourself
with
all
of
them
as
with
ornaments
And
you
will
fasten
them
on
yourself
as
a
bride
does
19
Although
your
places
were
devastated
and
desolate
and
your
land
was
in
ruins
Now
it
will
become
too
cramped
for
those
dwelling
there
And
those
who
swallowed
you
down
will
be
far
away
20
The
sons
born
when
you
were
bereaved
will
say
in
your
hearing
This
place
is
too
cramped
for
me
Make
room
for
me
to
dwell
here
21
And
you
will
say
in
your
heart
Who
has
fathered
these
for
me
Since
I
am
a
woman
bereaved
of
children
and
barren
Exiled
and
taken
prisoner
Who
has
raised
these
Look
I
was
left
all
alone
So
where
have
these
come
from
22
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Look
I
will
raise
up
my
hand
to
the
nations
And
I
will
lift
up
my
signal
to
the
peoples
They
will
bring
your
sons
in
their
armsAnd
carry
your
daughters
on
their
shoulders
23
Kings
will
become
caretakers
for
you
And
their
princesses
will
be
your
nurses
They
will
bow
down
to
you
with
their
faces
to
the
groundAnd
lick
the
dust
of
your
feet
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
Those
hoping
in
me
will
not
be
put
to
shame
24
Can
those
already
captured
be
taken
from
a
mighty
man
Or
can
the
captives
of
the
tyrant
be
rescued
25
But
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Even
the
captives
of
a
mighty
man
will
be
taken
away
And
those
captured
by
the
tyrant
will
be
rescued
I
will
oppose
those
who
oppose
you
And
I
will
save
your
own
sons
26
I
will
make
those
who
mistreat
you
eat
their
own
flesh
And
as
with
sweet
wine
they
will
become
drunk
with
their
own
blood
And
all
people
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
Your
Savior
and
your
Repurchaser
The
Powerful
One
of
Jacob
1
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Where
is
the
divorce
certificate
of
your
mother
whom
I
sent
away
Or
to
which
of
my
creditors
did
I
sell
you
Look
It
was
because
of
your
own
errors
you
were
sold
And
because
of
your
own
transgressions
your
mother
was
sent
away

2
Why
then
was
no
one
here
when
I
came
Why
did
no
one
answer
when
I
called
Is
my
hand
too
short
to
redeem
Or
is
there
no
power
in
me
to
rescue
Look
With
my
rebuke
I
dry
up
the
sea
I
make
rivers
a
desert
Their
fish
rot
for
lack
of
water
And
they
die
because
of
thirst

3
I
clothe
the
heavens
with
gloom
And
I
make
sackcloth
their
covering

4
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
has
given
me
the
tongue
of
those
taught
So
that
I
may
know
how
to
answer
the
tired
one
with
the
right
word
He
awakens
me
morning
by
morning
He
awakens
my
ear
to
listen
like
the
taught
ones

5
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
has
opened
my
ear
And
I
was
not
rebellious
I
did
not
turn
in
the
opposite
direction

6
I
offered
my
back
to
those
striking
meAnd
my
cheeks
to
those
who
plucked
them
bare
I
did
not
hide
my
face
from
humiliating
things
and
from
spit

7
But
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
will
help
me
That
is
why
I
will
not
feel
humiliated
That
is
why
I
have
set
my
face
like
a
flint
And
I
know
that
I
will
not
be
put
to
shame

8
The
One
who
declares
me
righteous
is
near
Who
can
accuse
me
Let
us
stand
up
together
Who
has
a
case
against
me
Let
him
approach
me

9
Look
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
will
help
me
Who
will
pronounce
me
guilty
Look
They
will
all
wear
out
like
a
garment
A
moth
will
eat
them
up
10
Who
among
you
fears
JehovahAnd
listens
to
the
voice
of
his
servant
Who
has
walked
in
deep
darkness
without
any
brightness
Let
him
trust
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
and
support
himself
on
his
God
11
Look
All
of
you
who
are
igniting
a
fire
Making
sparks
fly
Walk
in
the
light
of
your
fire
Among
the
sparks
you
have
set
ablaze
This
is
what
you
will
have
from
my
hand
In
sheer
pain
you
will
lie
down
1
Listen
to
me
you
who
are
pursuing
righteousness
You
who
are
seeking
Jehovah
Look
to
the
rock
from
which
you
were
hewnAnd
to
the
quarry
from
which
you
were
dug

2
Look
to
Abraham
your
fatherAnd
to
Sarah
who
gave
birth
to
you
For
he
was
only
one
when
I
called
him
And
I
blessed
him
and
made
him
many

3
For
Jehovah
will
comfort
Zion
He
will
bring
comfort
to
all
her
ruins
And
he
will
make
her
wilderness
like
EdenAnd
her
desert
plain
like
the
garden
of
Jehovah
Exultation
and
rejoicing
will
be
found
in
her
Thanksgiving
and
melodious
song

4
Pay
attention
to
me
O
my
people
And
give
ear
to
me
my
nation
For
a
law
will
go
out
from
me
And
my
justice
I
will
establish
as
a
light
to
the
peoples

5
My
righteousness
draws
near
My
salvation
will
go
out
And
my
arms
will
judge
the
peoples
In
me
the
islands
will
hope
And
for
my
arm
they
will
wait

6
Raise
your
eyes
to
the
heavens
And
look
at
the
earth
below
For
the
heavens
will
disperse
in
fragments
like
smoke
The
earth
will
wear
out
like
a
garment
And
its
inhabitants
will
die
like
gnats
But
my
salvation
will
be
eternal
And
my
righteousness
will
never
fail

7
Listen
to
me
you
who
know
righteousness
The
people
with
my
law
in
their
heart
Do
not
be
afraid
of
the
taunts
of
mortal
men
And
do
not
be
terrified
because
of
their
insults

8
For
a
moth
will
eat
them
up
just
like
a
garment
The
clothes
moth
will
devour
them
like
wool
But
my
righteousness
will
last
forever
And
my
salvation
for
all
generations

9
Awake
Awake
Clothe
yourself
with
strength
O
arm
of
Jehovah
Awake
as
in
the
days
of
long
ago
as
in
past
generations
Was
it
not
you
who
broke
Rahab
to
pieces
Who
pierced
the
sea
monster
10
Are
you
not
the
one
who
dried
up
the
sea
the
waters
of
the
vast
deep
The
one
who
made
the
depths
of
the
sea
a
roadway
for
the
repurchased
ones
to
cross
11
The
redeemed
ones
of
Jehovah
will
return
They
will
come
to
Zion
with
a
joyful
cry
And
unending
joy
will
crown
them
Exultation
and
rejoicing
will
be
theirs
And
grief
and
sighing
will
flee
away
12
I
myself
am
the
One
comforting
you
Why
should
you
be
afraid
of
a
mortal
man
who
will
dieAnd
of
a
son
of
man
who
will
wither
like
green
grass
13
Why
do
you
forget
Jehovah
your
Maker
The
One
who
stretched
out
the
heavens
and
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
And
all
day
long
you
were
in
constant
fear
of
the
rage
of
the
oppressor
As
though
he
were
in
a
position
to
bring
you
to
ruin
Where
now
is
the
rage
of
the
oppressor
14
The
one
bent
over
in
chains
will
soon
be
set
free
He
will
not
die
and
go
into
the
pit
Nor
will
his
bread
be
lacking
15
But
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
Who
stirs
up
the
sea
and
makes
its
waves
boisterous—Jehovah
of
armies
is
his
name
16
I
will
put
my
words
in
your
mouth
And
with
the
shadow
of
my
hand
I
will
cover
you
In
order
to
plant
the
heavens
and
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
earthAnd
to
say
to
Zion
You
are
my
people
17
Awake
Awake
Rise
up
O
Jerusalem
You
who
have
drunk
from
the
hand
of
Jehovah
his
cup
of
wrath
You
have
drunk
the
goblet
You
have
drained
out
the
cup
causing
staggering
18
Not
one
of
all
the
sons
whom
she
bore
is
there
to
guide
her
And
not
one
of
all
the
sons
whom
she
raised
has
taken
hold
of
her
hand
19
These
two
things
have
befallen
you
Who
will
sympathize
with
you
Destruction
and
devastation
hunger
and
sword
Who
will
comfort
you
20
Your
sons
have
fainted
They
lie
down
at
every
street
cornerLike
wild
sheep
in
the
net
They
are
full
of
the
wrath
of
Jehovah
the
rebuke
of
your
God
21
So
please
listen
to
this
O
woman
afflicted
and
drunk
though
not
with
wine
22
This
is
what
your
Lord
Jehovah
says
your
God
who
defends
his
people
Look
I
will
take
from
your
hand
the
cup
causing
staggering
The
goblet
my
cup
of
wrath
You
will
never
drink
it
again
23
I
will
put
it
into
the
hand
of
your
tormentors
Those
who
said
to
you
Bow
down
so
that
we
may
walk
over
you
So
you
made
your
back
like
the
ground
Like
a
street
for
them
to
walk
on
1
Awake
Awake
Clothe
yourself
with
strength
O
Zion
Put
on
your
beautiful
garments
O
Jerusalem
the
holy
city
For
no
more
will
the
uncircumcised
and
unclean
one
enter
into
you

2
Shake
off
the
dust
rise
and
take
a
seat
O
Jerusalem
Loosen
the
bonds
on
your
neck
O
captive
daughter
of
Zion

3
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
were
sold
for
nothing
And
without
money
you
will
be
repurchased

4
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
At
first
my
people
went
down
to
Egypt
to
live
there
as
foreigners
Then
Assyria
oppressed
them
without
cause

5
What
then
should
I
do
here
declares
Jehovah
For
my
people
were
taken
for
nothing
Those
ruling
over
them
keep
howling
in
triumph

declares
Jehovah
And
constantly
all
day
long
my
name
is
treated
with
disrespect

6
For
that
reason
my
people
will
know
my
name
For
that
reason
they
will
know
in
that
day
that
I
am
the
One
speaking
Look
it
is
I

7
How
beautiful
on
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
the
one
bringing
good
news
The
one
proclaiming
peace
The
one
bringing
good
news
of
something
better
The
one
proclaiming
salvation
The
one
saying
to
Zion
Your
God
has
become
King

8
Listen
Your
watchmen
raise
their
voice
In
unison
they
shout
joyfully
For
they
will
see
it
clearly
when
Jehovah
gathers
back
Zion

9
Become
cheerful
shout
joyfully
in
unison
you
ruins
of
Jerusalem
For
Jehovah
has
comforted
his
people
he
has
repurchased
Jerusalem
10
Jehovah
has
bared
his
holy
arm
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
All
the
ends
of
the
earth
will
see
the
acts
of
salvation
of
our
God
11
Turn
away
turn
away
get
out
of
there
touch
nothing
unclean
Get
out
from
the
midst
of
her
keep
yourselves
clean
You
who
are
carrying
the
utensils
of
Jehovah
12
For
you
will
not
depart
in
panic
Nor
will
you
have
to
flee
For
Jehovah
will
go
ahead
of
you
And
the
God
of
Israel
will
be
your
rear
guard
13
Look
My
servant
will
act
with
insight
He
will
be
raised
up
high
He
will
be
elevated
and
greatly
exalted
14
Just
as
there
were
many
who
stared
at
him
in
amazement—For
his
appearance
was
disfigured
more
than
that
of
any
other
manAnd
his
stately
form
more
than
that
of
mankind—15
So
he
will
startle
many
nations
Kings
will
shut
their
mouths
before
him
Because
they
will
see
what
they
had
not
been
toldAnd
give
consideration
to
what
they
had
not
heard
1
Who
has
put
faith
in
the
thing
heard
from
us
And
as
for
the
arm
of
Jehovah
to
whom
has
it
been
revealed

2
He
will
come
up
like
a
twig
before
him
like
a
root
out
of
parched
land
No
stately
form
does
he
have
nor
any
splendor
And
when
we
see
him
his
appearance
does
not
draw
us
to
him

3
He
was
despised
and
was
avoided
by
men
A
man
who
was
meant
for
pains
and
was
familiar
with
sickness
It
was
as
if
his
face
were
hidden
from
us
He
was
despised
and
we
held
him
as
of
no
account

4
Truly
he
himself
carried
our
sicknesses
And
he
bore
our
pains
But
we
considered
him
as
plagued
stricken
by
God
and
afflicted

5
But
he
was
pierced
for
our
transgression
He
was
crushed
for
our
errors
He
bore
the
punishment
for
our
peace
And
because
of
his
wounds
we
were
healed

6
Like
sheep
we
have
all
wandered
about
Each
has
turned
his
own
way
And
Jehovah
has
caused
the
error
of
us
all
to
meet
up
with
him

7
He
was
oppressed
and
he
let
himself
be
afflicted
But
he
would
not
open
his
mouth
He
was
brought
like
a
sheep
to
the
slaughter
Like
a
ewe
that
is
silent
before
its
shearers
And
he
would
not
open
his
mouth

8
Because
of
restraint
and
judgment
he
was
taken
away
And
who
will
concern
himself
with
the
details
of
his
generation
For
he
was
cut
off
from
the
land
of
the
living
Because
of
the
transgression
of
my
people
he
received
the
stroke

9
And
he
was
given
a
burial
place
with
the
wicked
And
with
the
rich
in
his
death
Although
he
had
done
no
wrongAnd
there
was
no
deception
in
his
mouth
10
But
it
was
Jehovahs
will
to
crush
him
and
he
let
him
become
sick
If
you
will
present
his
life
as
a
guilt
offering
He
will
see
his
offspring
he
will
prolong
his
days
And
through
him
the
delight
of
Jehovah
will
have
success
11
Because
of
his
anguish
he
will
see
and
be
satisfied
By
means
of
his
knowledge
the
righteous
one
my
servant
Will
bring
a
righteous
standing
to
many
people
And
their
errors
he
will
bear
12
For
that
reason
I
will
assign
him
a
portion
among
the
many
And
he
will
apportion
the
spoil
with
the
mighty
Because
he
poured
out
his
life
even
to
deathAnd
was
counted
among
the
transgressors
He
carried
the
sin
of
many
people
And
he
interceded
for
the
transgressors
1
Shout
joyfully
you
barren
woman
who
has
not
given
birth
Become
cheerful
and
cry
out
for
joy
you
who
never
had
birth
pains
For
the
sons
of
the
desolate
one
are
more
numerousThan
the
sons
of
the
woman
with
a
husband

says
Jehovah

2
Make
the
place
of
your
tent
more
spacious
Stretch
out
the
tent
cloths
of
your
grand
tabernacle
Do
not
hold
back
lengthen
your
tent
cords
And
make
your
tent
pins
strong

3
For
you
will
spread
out
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
Your
offspring
will
take
possession
of
nations
And
they
will
inhabit
the
desolated
cities

4
Do
not
be
afraid
for
you
will
not
be
put
to
shame
And
do
not
feel
humiliated
for
you
will
not
be
disappointed
For
you
will
forget
the
shame
of
your
youth
And
the
disgrace
of
your
widowhood
you
will
remember
no
more

5
For
your
Grand
Maker
is
as
your
husband
Jehovah
of
armies
is
his
name
And
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
is
your
Repurchaser
He
will
be
called
the
God
of
the
whole
earth

6
For
Jehovah
called
you
as
if
you
were
an
abandoned
wife
and
grief-stricken
Like
a
wife
married
in
youth
and
then
rejected

says
your
God

7
For
a
brief
moment
I
abandoned
you
But
with
great
mercy
I
will
gather
you
back

8
In
a
flood
of
indignation
I
hid
my
face
from
you
for
a
moment
But
with
everlasting
loyal
love
I
will
have
mercy
on
you

says
your
Repurchaser
Jehovah

9
This
is
like
the
days
of
Noah
to
me
Just
as
I
have
sworn
that
the
waters
of
Noah
will
no
more
cover
the
earth
So
I
swear
that
I
will
no
more
become
indignant
toward
you
or
rebuke
you
10
For
the
mountains
may
be
removedAnd
the
hills
may
be
shaken
But
my
loyal
love
will
not
be
removed
from
you
Nor
will
my
covenant
of
peace
be
shaken

says
Jehovah
the
One
having
mercy
on
you
11
O
afflicted
woman
storm-tossed
uncomforted
I
am
laying
your
stones
with
hard
mortarAnd
your
foundation
with
sapphires
12
I
will
make
your
battlements
of
rubies
Your
gates
of
sparkling
stones
And
all
your
boundaries
of
precious
stones
13
And
all
your
sons
will
be
taught
by
Jehovah
And
the
peace
of
your
sons
will
be
abundant
14
You
will
be
firmly
established
in
righteousness
You
will
be
far
removed
from
oppression
You
will
fear
nothing
and
have
no
cause
for
terror
For
it
will
not
come
near
you
15
If
anyone
should
attack
you
It
will
not
be
at
my
orders
Whoever
makes
an
attack
on
you
will
fall
because
of
you
16
Look
I
myself
created
the
craftsman
Who
blows
on
the
charcoal
fire
And
his
work
produces
a
weapon
I
myself
also
created
the
destructive
man
to
bring
ruin
17
No
weapon
formed
against
you
will
have
any
success
And
you
will
condemn
any
tongue
that
rises
up
against
you
in
the
judgment
This
is
the
heritage
of
the
servants
of
Jehovah
And
their
righteousness
is
from
me

declares
Jehovah
1
Come
all
you
thirsty
ones
come
to
the
water
You
with
no
money
come
buy
and
eat
Yes
come
buy
wine
and
milk
without
money
and
without
cost

2
Why
do
you
keep
paying
out
money
for
what
is
not
bread
And
why
spend
your
earnings
for
what
brings
no
satisfaction
Listen
intently
to
me
and
eat
what
is
good
And
you
will
find
great
delight
in
what
is
truly
rich

3
Incline
your
ear
and
come
to
me
Listen
and
you
will
keep
alive
And
I
will
readily
make
with
you
an
everlasting
covenantIn
harmony
with
the
expressions
of
loyal
love
to
David
which
are
faithful

4
Look
I
made
him
a
witness
to
the
nations
A
leader
and
commander
to
the
nations

5
Look
You
will
call
a
nation
that
you
do
not
know
And
those
of
a
nation
who
have
not
known
you
will
run
to
youFor
the
sake
of
Jehovah
your
God
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
Because
he
will
glorify
you

6
Search
for
Jehovah
while
he
may
be
found
Call
to
him
while
he
is
near

7
Let
the
wicked
man
leave
his
wayAnd
the
evil
man
his
thoughts
Let
him
return
to
Jehovah
who
will
have
mercy
on
him
To
our
God
for
he
will
forgive
in
a
large
way

8
For
my
thoughts
are
not
your
thoughts
And
your
ways
are
not
my
ways

declares
Jehovah

9
For
as
the
heavens
are
higher
than
the
earth
So
my
ways
are
higher
than
your
waysAnd
my
thoughts
than
your
thoughts
10
For
just
as
the
rain
and
the
snow
pour
down
from
heavenAnd
do
not
return
there
until
they
saturate
the
earth
making
it
produce
and
sprout
Giving
seed
to
the
sower
and
bread
to
the
eater
11
So
my
word
that
goes
out
of
my
mouth
will
be
It
will
not
return
to
me
without
results
But
it
will
certainly
accomplish
whatever
is
my
delight
And
it
will
have
sure
success
in
what
I
send
it
to
do
12
For
you
will
go
out
with
rejoicing
And
in
peace
you
will
be
brought
back
The
mountains
and
the
hills
will
become
cheerful
before
you
with
a
joyful
cry
And
the
trees
of
the
field
will
all
clap
their
hands
13
Instead
of
thornbushes
the
juniper
tree
will
grow
And
instead
of
the
stinging
nettle
the
myrtle
tree
will
grow
And
it
will
bring
fame
to
Jehovah
An
everlasting
sign
that
will
never
perish
1
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Uphold
justice
and
do
what
is
righteous
For
my
salvation
will
soon
comeAnd
my
righteousness
will
be
revealed

2
Happy
is
the
man
who
does
thisAnd
the
son
of
man
who
holds
fast
to
it
Who
keeps
the
Sabbath
and
does
not
profane
itAnd
who
holds
his
hand
back
from
any
kind
of
evil

3
The
foreigner
who
joins
himself
to
Jehovah
should
not
say
Jehovah
will
surely
separate
me
from
his
people
And
the
eunuch
should
not
say
Look
I
am
a
dried-up
tree
4
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
to
the
eunuchs
who
keep
my
sabbaths
and
who
choose
what
I
delight
in
and
who
hold
fast
to
my
covenant

5
I
will
give
to
them
in
my
house
and
within
my
walls
a
monument
and
a
name
Something
better
than
sons
and
daughters
An
everlasting
name
I
will
give
them
One
that
will
not
perish

6
As
for
the
foreigners
who
join
themselves
to
Jehovah
to
minister
to
him
To
love
the
name
of
JehovahAnd
to
be
his
servants
All
those
who
keep
the
Sabbath
and
do
not
profane
itAnd
who
hold
fast
to
my
covenant
7
I
will
also
bring
them
to
my
holy
mountainAnd
make
them
rejoice
inside
my
house
of
prayer
Their
whole
burnt
offerings
and
their
sacrifices
will
be
accepted
on
my
altar
For
my
house
will
be
called
a
house
of
prayer
for
all
the
peoples
8
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
who
is
gathering
the
dispersed
ones
of
Israel
declares
I
will
gather
to
him
others
besides
those
already
gathered

9
All
you
wild
animals
of
the
field
come
to
eat
All
you
wild
animals
in
the
forest
10
His
watchmen
are
blind
none
of
them
have
taken
note
All
of
them
are
speechless
dogs
unable
to
bark
They
are
panting
and
lying
down
they
love
to
slumber
11
They
are
dogs
with
a
voracious
appetite
They
are
never
satisfied
They
are
shepherds
who
have
no
understanding
They
have
all
gone
their
own
way
Every
last
one
of
them
seeks
his
own
dishonest
gain
and
says
12
Come
let
me
take
some
wine
And
let
us
drink
our
fill
of
alcohol
And
tomorrow
will
be
like
today
only
far
better
1
The
righteous
one
has
perished
But
no
one
takes
it
to
heart
Loyal
men
are
taken
away
With
no
one
discerning
that
the
righteous
one
has
been
taken
awayBecause
of
the
calamity

2
He
enters
into
peace
They
rest
on
their
beds
all
who
walk
uprightly

3
But
as
for
you
come
closer
You
sons
of
a
sorceress
You
children
of
an
adulterer
and
a
prostitute

4
Whom
are
you
making
fun
of
Against
whom
do
you
open
your
mouth
wide
and
stick
out
your
tongue
Are
you
not
the
children
of
transgression
The
children
of
deceit
5
Those
who
are
inflamed
with
passion
among
big
trees
Under
every
luxuriant
tree
Who
slaughter
the
children
in
the
valleys
Under
the
clefts
of
the
crags

6
With
the
smooth
stones
of
the
valley
is
your
portion
Yes
these
are
your
lot
Even
to
them
you
pour
out
drink
offerings
and
offer
gifts
Should
I
be
satisfied
with
these
things

7
On
a
mountain
high
and
lofty
you
prepared
your
bed
And
you
went
up
there
to
offer
sacrifice

8
Behind
the
door
and
the
doorpost
you
set
up
your
memorial
You
left
me
and
uncovered
yourself
You
went
up
and
made
your
bed
spacious
And
you
made
a
covenant
with
them
You
loved
sharing
their
bed
And
you
gazed
at
the
male
organ

9
You
went
down
to
Melech
with
oilAnd
with
an
abundance
of
perfume
You
sent
your
envoys
far
off
So
that
you
descended
to
the
Grave
10
You
have
toiled
in
following
your
many
ways
But
you
did
not
say
It
is
hopeless
You
found
renewed
strength
That
is
why
you
do
not
give
up
11
Whom
did
you
dread
and
fearSo
that
you
started
to
lie
You
did
not
remember
me
You
took
nothing
to
heart
Have
I
not
kept
silent
and
withdrawn
So
you
showed
no
fear
of
me
12
I
will
make
known
your
righteousness
and
your
works
And
they
will
not
benefit
you
13
When
you
cry
for
help
Your
collection
of
idols
will
not
rescue
you
A
wind
will
carry
all
of
them
away
A
mere
breath
will
blow
them
away
But
the
one
who
takes
refuge
in
me
will
inherit
the
landAnd
will
take
possession
of
my
holy
mountain
14
It
will
be
said
Build
up
build
up
a
road
Prepare
the
way
Remove
any
obstacle
from
the
way
of
my
people
15
For
this
is
what
the
High
and
Lofty
One
says
Who
lives
forever
and
whose
name
is
holy
I
reside
in
the
high
and
holy
place
But
also
with
those
crushed
and
lowly
in
spirit
To
revive
the
spirit
of
the
lowlyAnd
to
revive
the
heart
of
those
being
crushed
16
For
I
will
not
oppose
them
foreverOr
always
remain
indignant
For
a
mans
spirit
would
grow
feeble
because
of
me
Even
the
breathing
creatures
that
I
have
made
17
I
was
indignant
at
his
sinful
pursuit
of
dishonest
gain
So
I
struck
him
I
hid
my
face
and
I
was
indignant
But
he
kept
walking
as
a
renegade
following
the
way
of
his
heart
18
I
have
seen
his
ways
But
I
will
heal
him
and
lead
himAnd
restore
comfort
to
him
and
to
his
mourning
ones
19
I
am
creating
the
fruit
of
the
lips
Continuous
peace
will
be
given
to
the
one
who
is
far
away
and
the
one
who
is
near

says
Jehovah
And
I
will
heal
him
20
But
the
wicked
are
like
the
restless
sea
that
cannot
calm
down
And
its
waters
keep
tossing
up
seaweed
and
mire
21
There
is
no
peace

says
my
God
for
the
wicked
1
Call
out
full-throated
do
not
hold
back
Raise
your
voice
like
a
horn
Proclaim
to
my
people
their
revolt
To
the
house
of
Jacob
their
sins

2
They
seek
me
day
after
day
And
they
express
delight
to
know
my
ways
As
if
they
were
a
nation
that
had
practiced
righteousnessAnd
had
not
abandoned
the
justice
of
their
God
They
ask
me
for
righteous
judgments
Delighting
to
draw
close
to
God

3
Why
do
you
not
see
when
we
fast
And
why
do
you
not
notice
when
we
afflict
ourselves
Because
on
the
day
of
your
fast
you
pursue
your
own
interests
And
you
oppress
your
laborers

4
Your
fasting
ends
in
quarrels
and
fights
And
you
strike
with
the
fist
of
wickedness
You
cannot
fast
as
you
do
today
and
have
your
voice
heard
in
heaven

5
Should
the
fast
that
I
choose
be
like
this
As
a
day
for
someone
to
afflict
himself
To
bow
down
his
head
like
a
rush
To
make
his
bed
on
sackcloth
and
ashes
Is
this
what
you
call
a
fast
and
a
day
pleasing
to
Jehovah

6
No
this
is
the
fast
that
I
choose
To
remove
the
fetters
of
wickedness
To
untie
the
bands
of
the
yoke
bar
To
let
the
oppressed
go
free
And
to
break
in
half
every
yoke
bar
7
It
is
to
share
your
bread
with
the
hungry
To
bring
the
poor
and
homeless
into
your
house
To
clothe
someone
naked
when
you
see
him
And
not
to
turn
your
back
on
your
own
flesh

8
Then
your
light
will
shine
through
like
the
dawn
And
your
healing
will
spring
up
quickly
Your
righteousness
will
go
before
you
And
the
glory
of
Jehovah
will
be
your
rear
guard

9
Then
you
will
call
and
Jehovah
will
answer
You
will
cry
for
help
and
he
will
say
Here
I
am
If
you
remove
from
among
you
the
yoke
barAnd
stop
pointing
your
finger
and
speaking
maliciously
10
If
you
grant
to
the
hungry
what
you
yourself
desireAnd
satisfy
those
who
are
afflicted
Then
your
light
will
shine
even
in
the
darkness
And
your
gloom
will
be
like
midday
11
Jehovah
will
always
lead
youAnd
satisfy
you
even
in
a
parched
land
He
will
invigorate
your
bones
And
you
will
become
like
a
well-watered
garden
Like
a
spring
whose
waters
never
fail
12
They
will
rebuild
ancient
ruins
on
your
account
And
you
will
restore
the
foundations
of
past
generations
You
will
be
called
the
repairer
of
the
broken
walls
The
restorer
of
roadways
by
which
to
dwell
13
If
because
of
the
Sabbath
you
refrain
from
pursuing
your
own
interests
on
my
holy
dayAnd
you
call
the
Sabbath
an
exquisite
delight
a
holy
day
of
Jehovah
a
day
to
be
glorified
And
you
glorify
it
rather
than
pursuing
your
own
interests
and
speaking
idle
words
14
Then
you
will
find
your
exquisite
delight
in
Jehovah
And
I
will
make
you
ride
on
the
high
places
of
the
earth
I
will
cause
you
to
eat
from
the
inheritance
of
Jacob
your
forefather
For
the
mouth
of
Jehovah
has
spoken
1
Look
The
hand
of
Jehovah
is
not
too
short
to
save
Nor
is
his
ear
too
dull
to
hear

2
No
your
own
errors
have
separated
you
from
your
God
Your
sins
have
made
him
hide
his
face
from
you
And
he
refuses
to
hear
you

3
For
your
palms
are
polluted
with
bloodAnd
your
fingers
with
error
Your
lips
speak
lies
and
your
tongue
mutters
unrighteousness

4
No
one
calls
out
for
righteousness
And
no
one
goes
to
court
in
truthfulness
They
trust
in
unreality
and
speak
what
is
worthless
They
conceive
trouble
and
give
birth
to
what
is
harmful

5
They
hatch
the
eggs
of
a
poisonous
snake
And
they
weave
the
cobweb
of
a
spider
Anyone
who
eats
their
eggs
would
die
And
the
egg
that
is
crushed
hatches
a
viper

6
Their
cobweb
will
not
serve
as
a
garment
Nor
will
they
cover
themselves
with
what
they
make
Their
works
are
harmful
And
deeds
of
violence
are
in
their
hands

7
Their
feet
run
to
do
evil
And
they
hurry
to
shed
innocent
blood
Their
thoughts
are
harmful
thoughts
Ruin
and
misery
are
in
their
ways

8
They
have
not
known
the
way
of
peace
And
there
is
no
justice
in
their
tracks
They
make
their
roadways
crooked
No
one
treading
on
them
will
know
peace

9
That
is
why
justice
is
far
away
from
us
And
righteousness
does
not
overtake
us
We
keep
hoping
for
light
but
look
there
is
darkness
For
brightness
but
we
keep
walking
in
gloom
10
We
grope
for
the
wall
like
blind
men
Like
those
without
eyes
we
keep
groping
We
stumble
at
high
noon
as
in
evening
darkness
Among
the
strong
we
are
just
like
the
dead
11
We
all
keep
growling
like
bearsAnd
cooing
mournfully
like
doves
We
hope
for
justice
but
there
is
none
For
salvation
but
it
is
far
away
from
us
12
For
our
revolts
are
many
before
you
Each
of
our
sins
testifies
against
us
For
our
revolts
are
with
us
We
well
know
our
errors
13
We
have
transgressed
and
denied
Jehovah
We
have
turned
our
backs
on
our
God
We
have
spoken
of
oppression
and
revolt
We
have
conceived
lies
and
muttered
false
words
from
the
heart
14
Justice
is
driven
back
And
righteousness
stands
far
off
For
truth
has
stumbled
in
the
public
square
And
what
is
upright
is
unable
to
enter
15
Truth
has
vanished
And
anyone
who
turns
away
from
bad
is
plundered
Jehovah
saw
this
and
was
displeased
For
there
was
no
justice
16
He
saw
that
there
was
no
man
And
he
was
astonished
that
no
one
interceded
So
his
own
arm
brought
about
salvation
And
his
own
righteousness
supported
him
17
Then
he
put
on
righteousness
like
a
coat
of
mailAnd
the
helmet
of
salvation
on
his
head
He
put
on
the
garments
of
vengeance
as
his
clothingAnd
wrapped
himself
with
zeal
like
a
coat
18
He
will
reward
them
for
what
they
have
done
Wrath
to
his
adversaries
retribution
to
his
enemies
And
to
the
islands
he
will
repay
their
due
19
From
the
sunset
they
will
fear
the
name
of
JehovahAnd
from
the
sunrise
his
glory
For
he
will
come
in
like
a
rushing
river
Which
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
drives
along
20
To
Zion
the
Repurchaser
will
come
To
those
in
Jacob
who
turn
from
transgression

declares
Jehovah
21
As
for
me
this
is
my
covenant
with
them

says
Jehovah
My
spirit
that
is
on
you
and
my
words
that
I
have
placed
in
your
mouth—they
will
not
be
removed
from
your
mouth
from
the
mouth
of
your
children
or
from
the
mouth
of
your
grandchildren

says
Jehovah
from
now
on
and
forever
1
Arise
O
woman
shed
light
for
your
light
has
come
The
glory
of
Jehovah
shines
on
you

2
For
look
darkness
will
cover
the
earthAnd
thick
gloom
the
nations
But
on
you
Jehovah
will
shine
And
on
you
his
glory
will
be
seen

3
Nations
will
go
to
your
lightAnd
kings
to
your
shining
splendor

4
Raise
your
eyes
and
look
all
around
you
They
have
all
been
assembled
they
are
coming
to
you
From
far
away
your
sons
keep
coming
And
your
daughters
being
supported
on
the
hip

5
At
that
time
you
will
see
and
become
radiant
And
your
heart
will
throb
and
overflow
Because
the
wealth
of
the
sea
will
be
directed
to
you
The
resources
of
the
nations
will
come
to
you

6
Throngs
of
camels
will
cover
your
land
Young
male
camels
of
Midian
and
Ephah
All
those
from
Sheba—they
will
come
Gold
and
frankincense
they
will
carry
They
will
proclaim
the
praises
of
Jehovah

7
All
the
flocks
of
Kedar
will
be
gathered
to
you
The
rams
of
Nebaioth
will
serve
you
They
will
come
on
my
altar
with
approval
And
I
will
beautify
my
glorious
house

8
Who
are
these
that
fly
along
like
clouds
Like
doves
to
their
dovecotes

9
For
in
me
the
islands
will
hope
The
ships
of
Tarshish
are
in
the
lead
To
bring
your
sons
from
far
away
Along
with
their
silver
and
their
gold
To
the
name
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
to
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
For
he
will
glorify
you
10
Foreigners
will
build
your
walls
And
their
kings
will
minister
to
you
For
in
my
indignation
I
struck
you
But
in
my
favor
I
will
have
mercy
on
you
11
Your
gates
will
be
kept
open
constantly
They
will
not
be
closed
by
day
or
by
night
To
bring
to
you
the
resources
of
the
nations
And
their
kings
will
take
the
lead
12
For
any
nation
and
any
kingdom
that
will
not
serve
you
will
perish
And
the
nations
will
be
utterly
devastated
13
To
you
the
glory
of
Lebanon
will
come
The
juniper
tree
the
ash
tree
and
the
cypress
together
To
beautify
the
place
of
my
sanctuary
I
will
glorify
the
place
for
my
feet
14
The
sons
of
those
who
oppressed
you
will
come
and
bow
down
before
you
All
those
treating
you
disrespectfully
must
bow
down
at
your
feet
And
they
will
have
to
call
you
the
city
of
Jehovah
Zion
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
15
Instead
of
your
being
abandoned
and
hated
with
nobody
passing
through
I
will
make
you
a
source
of
everlasting
pride
A
cause
for
rejoicing
throughout
all
generations
16
And
you
will
actually
drink
the
milk
of
nations
At
the
breast
of
kings
you
will
nurse
And
you
will
certainly
know
that
I
Jehovah
am
your
Savior
And
the
Powerful
One
of
Jacob
is
your
Repurchaser
17
Instead
of
the
copper
I
will
bring
in
gold
And
instead
of
the
iron
I
will
bring
in
silver
Instead
of
the
wood
copper
And
instead
of
the
stones
iron
And
I
will
appoint
peace
as
your
overseersAnd
righteousness
as
your
task
assigners
18
No
more
will
violence
be
heard
in
your
landOr
destruction
and
ruin
within
your
boundaries
And
you
will
call
your
walls
Salvation
and
your
gates
Praise
19
For
you
the
sun
will
no
longer
be
a
light
by
day
Nor
will
the
shining
of
the
moon
give
you
light
For
Jehovah
will
become
to
you
an
eternal
light
And
your
God
will
be
your
beauty
20
No
more
will
your
sun
set
Nor
will
your
moon
wane
For
Jehovah
will
become
for
you
an
eternal
light
And
the
days
of
your
mourning
will
have
ended
21
And
all
your
people
will
be
righteous
They
will
possess
the
land
forever
They
are
the
sprout
that
I
planted
The
work
of
my
hands
for
me
to
be
beautified
22
The
little
one
will
become
a
thousandAnd
the
small
one
a
mighty
nation
I
myself
Jehovah
will
speed
it
up
in
its
own
time
1
The
spirit
of
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
is
upon
me
Because
Jehovah
anointed
me
to
declare
good
news
to
the
meek
He
sent
me
to
bind
up
the
brokenhearted
To
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captivesAnd
the
wide
opening
of
the
eyes
to
the
prisoners
2
To
proclaim
the
year
of
Jehovahs
goodwillAnd
the
day
of
vengeance
of
our
God
To
comfort
all
who
mourn
3
To
provide
for
those
mourning
over
Zion
To
give
them
a
headdress
instead
of
ashes
The
oil
of
exultation
instead
of
mourning
The
garment
of
praise
instead
of
a
despondent
spirit
And
they
will
be
called
big
trees
of
righteousness
The
planting
of
Jehovah
in
order
to
glorify
him

4
They
will
rebuild
the
ancient
ruins
They
will
raise
up
the
desolated
places
of
the
past
And
they
will
restore
the
devastated
cities
The
places
that
lay
desolate
for
generation
after
generation

5
Strangers
will
stand
and
shepherd
your
flocks
And
foreigners
will
be
your
farmers
and
your
vinedressers

6
As
for
you
you
will
be
called
the
priests
of
Jehovah
They
will
call
you
the
ministers
of
our
God
You
will
eat
the
resources
of
the
nations
And
about
their
glory
you
will
boast

7
Instead
of
shame
you
will
have
a
double
portion
And
instead
of
humiliation
they
will
shout
joyfully
over
their
share
Yes
they
will
possess
a
double
portion
in
their
land
Everlasting
rejoicing
will
be
theirs

8
For
I
Jehovah
love
justice
I
hate
robbery
and
unrighteousness
I
will
faithfully
give
them
their
wages
And
I
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
them

9
Their
offspring
will
be
known
among
the
nationsAnd
their
descendants
among
the
peoples
All
who
see
them
will
recognize
them
That
they
are
the
offspring
whom
Jehovah
has
blessed
10
I
will
greatly
exult
in
Jehovah
My
whole
being
will
rejoice
in
my
God
For
he
has
clothed
me
with
the
garments
of
salvation
He
has
wrapped
me
with
the
robe
of
righteousness
Just
like
a
bridegroom
who
wears
a
turban
like
that
of
a
priest
And
like
a
bride
who
adorns
herself
with
her
ornaments
11
For
as
the
earth
brings
forth
its
sproutsAnd
as
the
garden
makes
what
is
sown
in
it
sprout
So
will
the
Sovereign
Lord
JehovahCause
righteousness
and
praise
to
sprout
before
all
the
nations
1
For
the
sake
of
Zion
I
will
not
keep
silent
And
for
the
sake
of
Jerusalem
I
will
not
keep
stillUntil
her
righteousness
shines
like
a
bright
lightAnd
her
salvation
burns
like
a
torch

2
The
nations
will
see
your
righteousness
O
woman
And
all
kings
your
glory
And
you
will
be
called
by
a
new
name
Which
Jehovahs
own
mouth
will
designate

3
You
will
become
a
crown
of
beauty
in
the
hand
of
Jehovah
A
royal
turban
in
the
palm
of
your
God

4
No
more
will
you
be
called
an
abandoned
woman
And
your
land
will
no
longer
be
called
desolate
But
you
will
be
called
My
Delight
Is
in
Her
And
your
land
will
be
called
the
Married
One
For
Jehovah
will
take
delight
in
you
And
your
land
will
be
as
one
married

5
For
just
as
a
young
man
marries
a
virgin
Your
sons
will
marry
you
With
the
rejoicing
of
a
bridegroom
over
a
bride
Your
God
will
rejoice
over
you

6
Upon
your
walls
O
Jerusalem
I
have
commissioned
watchmen
Continuously
all
day
long
and
all
night
long
they
should
not
be
silent
You
who
make
mention
of
Jehovah
Do
not
rest
7
And
do
not
give
him
any
rest
until
he
firmly
establishes
Jerusalem
Yes
until
he
makes
her
the
praise
of
the
earth

8
Jehovah
has
sworn
an
oath
with
his
right
hand
with
his
strong
arm
I
will
no
longer
give
your
grain
as
food
to
your
enemies
Nor
will
foreigners
drink
your
new
wine
for
which
you
have
toiled

9
But
those
gathering
it
will
eat
it
and
they
will
praise
Jehovah
And
those
collecting
it
will
drink
it
in
my
holy
courtyards
10
Pass
through
pass
through
the
gates
Clear
the
way
for
the
people
Build
up
build
up
the
highway
Rid
it
of
stones
Raise
up
a
signal
for
the
peoples
11
Look
Jehovah
has
proclaimed
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
Say
to
the
daughter
of
Zion
Look
Your
salvation
is
coming
Look
His
reward
is
with
him
And
the
wage
he
pays
is
before
him
12
They
will
be
called
the
holy
people
those
repurchased
by
Jehovah
And
you
will
be
called
Sought
After
a
City
Not
Abandoned
1
Who
is
this
coming
from
Edom
From
Bozrah
with
bright-colored
garments
This
one
with
splendid
clothing
Marching
in
his
great
power
It
is
I
the
One
speaking
in
righteousness
The
One
with
great
power
to
save

2
Why
is
your
clothing
red
And
why
are
your
garments
like
those
of
one
treading
the
winepress

3
I
have
trodden
the
wine
trough
alone
No
one
from
the
peoples
was
with
me
I
kept
treading
them
in
my
anger
And
I
kept
trampling
them
in
my
wrath
My
garments
were
spattered
with
their
blood
And
I
have
stained
all
my
clothing

4
For
the
day
of
vengeance
is
in
my
heart
And
the
year
of
my
repurchased
ones
has
come

5
I
looked
but
there
was
no
one
to
help
I
was
appalled
that
no
one
offered
support
So
my
arm
brought
me
salvation
And
my
own
wrath
supported
me

6
I
trampled
peoples
in
my
anger
I
made
them
drunk
with
my
wrathAnd
poured
out
their
blood
on
the
ground

7
I
will
mention
Jehovahs
acts
of
loyal
love
The
praiseworthy
acts
of
Jehovah
Because
of
all
that
Jehovah
has
done
for
us
The
many
good
things
he
has
done
for
the
house
of
Israel
According
to
his
mercy
and
his
great
loyal
love

8
For
he
said
Surely
they
are
my
people
sons
who
will
not
be
disloyal
So
he
became
their
Savior

9
During
all
their
distress
it
was
distressing
to
him
And
his
own
personal
messenger
saved
them
In
his
love
and
compassion
he
repurchased
them
And
he
lifted
them
up
and
carried
them
all
the
days
of
old
10
But
they
rebelled
and
grieved
his
holy
spirit
He
then
turned
into
their
enemy
And
he
fought
against
them
11
And
they
remembered
the
days
of
old
The
days
of
Moses
his
servant
Where
is
the
One
who
brought
them
up
out
of
the
sea
with
the
shepherds
of
his
flock
Where
is
the
One
who
put
within
him
His
holy
spirit
12
The
One
who
made
His
glorious
arm
go
with
the
right
hand
of
Moses
The
One
who
split
the
waters
before
themTo
make
an
everlasting
name
for
himself
13
The
One
who
made
them
walk
through
the
surging
waters
So
that
they
walked
without
stumbling
Like
a
horse
in
the
open
country
14
Just
like
livestock
when
they
go
down
into
the
valley
plain
The
spirit
of
Jehovah
made
them
rest
This
is
how
you
led
your
people
To
make
a
majestic
name
for
yourself
15
Look
down
from
heaven
and
seeFrom
your
lofty
abode
of
holiness
and
glory
Where
are
your
zeal
and
your
mightiness
The
stirring
of
your
compassions
and
your
mercy
They
are
withheld
from
me
16
For
you
are
our
Father
Although
Abraham
may
not
know
usAnd
Israel
may
not
recognize
us
You
O
Jehovah
are
our
Father
Our
Repurchaser
of
long
ago
is
your
name
17
Why
do
you
O
Jehovah
let
us
wander
from
your
ways
Why
do
you
let
our
hearts
become
hard
so
that
we
do
not
fear
you
Return
for
the
sake
of
your
servants
The
tribes
of
your
inheritance
18
Your
holy
people
possessed
it
for
a
short
time
Our
adversaries
have
trampled
on
your
sanctuary
19
For
too
long
we
have
become
like
those
you
never
ruled
over
Like
those
never
called
by
your
name
1
If
only
you
had
ripped
the
heavens
apart
and
come
down
So
that
the
mountains
would
quake
because
of
you
2
As
when
a
fire
ignites
the
brushwood
And
the
fire
makes
the
water
boil
Then
your
name
would
be
known
to
your
adversaries
And
the
nations
would
tremble
before
you

3
When
you
did
awe-inspiring
things
that
we
dared
not
hope
for
You
came
down
and
the
mountains
quaked
before
you

4
From
of
old
no
one
has
heard
or
given
ear
Nor
has
any
eye
seen
a
God
except
you
Who
acts
in
behalf
of
those
who
keep
in
expectation
of
him

5
You
have
met
up
with
those
who
joyfully
do
what
is
right
Those
who
remember
you
and
follow
your
ways
Look
You
became
indignant
while
we
kept
sinning
We
did
so
for
a
long
time
Should
we
now
be
saved

6
And
we
have
all
become
like
someone
unclean
And
all
our
acts
of
righteousness
are
like
a
menstrual
cloth
We
will
all
wither
like
a
leaf
And
our
errors
will
carry
us
off
like
the
wind

7
There
is
no
one
calling
on
your
name
No
one
who
stirs
himself
to
take
hold
of
you
For
you
have
hidden
your
face
from
us
And
you
cause
us
to
waste
away
because
of
our
error

8
But
now
O
Jehovah
you
are
our
Father
We
are
the
clay
and
you
are
our
Potter
We
are
all
the
work
of
your
hand

9
Do
not
become
too
indignant
O
Jehovah
And
do
not
remember
our
error
forever
Look
at
us
please
for
we
are
all
your
people
10
Your
holy
cities
have
become
a
wilderness
Zion
has
become
a
wilderness
Jerusalem
a
wasteland
11
Our
house
of
holiness
and
glory
Where
our
forefathers
praised
you
Has
been
burned
with
fire
And
all
the
things
we
cherished
lie
in
ruins
12
In
view
of
this
will
you
still
restrain
yourself
O
Jehovah
Will
you
remain
silent
and
let
us
be
afflicted
so
severely
1
I
have
let
myself
be
searched
for
by
those
who
did
not
ask
for
me
I
have
let
myself
be
found
by
those
who
did
not
look
for
me
I
said
Here
I
am
here
I
am
to
a
nation
that
was
not
calling
on
my
name

2
I
have
spread
out
my
hands
all
day
long
to
a
stubborn
people
To
those
walking
in
the
way
that
is
not
good
Following
their
own
thoughts
3
A
people
who
constantly
offend
me
to
my
face
Sacrificing
in
gardens
and
making
sacrificial
smoke
on
bricks

4
They
sit
among
graves
And
they
pass
the
night
in
hidden
places
Eating
the
flesh
of
pigs
And
the
broth
of
foul
things
is
in
their
vessels

5
They
say
Keep
to
yourself
do
not
approach
me
For
I
am
holier
than
you
These
are
a
smoke
in
my
nostrils
a
fire
burning
all
day
long

6
Look
It
is
written
before
me
I
will
not
stand
still
But
I
will
repay
them
I
will
repay
them
in
full
measure
7
For
their
errors
and
for
the
errors
of
their
forefathers
as
well

says
Jehovah
Because
they
have
made
sacrificial
smoke
on
the
mountainsAnd
have
reproached
me
on
the
hills
I
will
first
measure
out
their
wages
in
full

8
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Just
as
when
new
wine
is
found
in
a
cluster
of
grapesAnd
someone
says
Do
not
destroy
it
for
there
is
some
good
in
it

So
I
will
do
for
the
sake
of
my
servants
I
will
not
destroy
them
all

9
I
will
bring
out
of
Jacob
an
offspringAnd
out
of
Judah
the
one
to
inherit
my
mountains
My
chosen
ones
will
take
possession
of
it
And
my
servants
will
reside
there
10
Sharon
will
become
a
pasture
for
sheepAnd
the
Valley
of
Achor
a
resting-place
for
cattle
For
my
people
who
search
for
me
11
But
you
are
among
those
forsaking
Jehovah
Those
forgetting
my
holy
mountain
Those
setting
a
table
for
the
god
of
Good
Luck
And
those
filling
up
cups
of
mixed
wine
for
the
god
of
Destiny
12
So
I
will
destine
you
for
the
sword
And
all
of
you
will
bow
down
to
be
slaughtered
Because
I
called
but
you
did
not
answer
I
spoke
but
you
did
not
listen
You
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
my
eyes
And
you
chose
what
displeased
me
13
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Look
My
servants
will
eat
but
you
will
go
hungry
Look
My
servants
will
drink
but
you
will
go
thirsty
Look
My
servants
will
rejoice
but
you
will
suffer
shame
14
Look
My
servants
will
shout
joyfully
because
of
the
good
condition
of
the
heart
But
you
will
cry
out
because
of
the
pain
of
heartAnd
you
will
wail
because
of
a
broken
spirit
15
You
will
leave
behind
a
name
that
my
chosen
ones
will
use
as
a
curse
And
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
will
put
each
of
you
to
death
But
his
own
servants
he
will
call
by
another
name
16
So
that
anyone
who
seeks
a
blessing
for
himself
in
the
earthWill
be
blessed
by
the
God
of
truth
And
anyone
who
swears
an
oath
in
the
earthWill
swear
by
the
God
of
truth
For
the
former
distresses
will
be
forgotten
They
will
be
concealed
from
my
eyes
17
For
look
I
am
creating
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
And
the
former
things
will
not
be
called
to
mind
Nor
will
they
come
up
into
the
heart
18
So
exult
and
be
joyful
forever
in
what
I
am
creating
For
look
I
am
creating
Jerusalem
a
cause
for
joyAnd
her
people
a
cause
for
exultation
19
And
I
will
rejoice
in
Jerusalem
and
exult
in
my
people
No
more
will
there
be
heard
in
her
the
sound
of
weeping
or
a
cry
of
distress
20
No
more
will
there
be
an
infant
from
that
place
who
lives
but
a
few
days
Nor
an
old
man
who
fails
to
live
out
his
days
For
anyone
who
dies
at
a
hundred
will
be
considered
a
mere
boy
And
the
sinner
will
be
cursed
even
though
he
is
a
hundred
years
of
age
21
They
will
build
houses
and
live
in
them
And
they
will
plant
vineyards
and
eat
their
fruitage
22
They
will
not
build
for
someone
else
to
inhabit
Nor
will
they
plant
for
others
to
eat
For
the
days
of
my
people
will
be
like
the
days
of
a
tree
And
the
work
of
their
hands
my
chosen
ones
will
enjoy
to
the
full
23
They
will
not
toil
for
nothing
Nor
will
they
bear
children
for
distress
Because
they
are
the
offspring
made
up
of
those
blessed
by
Jehovah
And
their
descendants
with
them
24
Even
before
they
call
out
I
will
answer
While
they
are
yet
speaking
I
will
hear
25
The
wolf
and
the
lamb
will
feed
together
The
lion
will
eat
straw
just
like
the
bull
And
the
serpents
food
will
be
dust
They
will
do
no
harm
nor
cause
any
ruin
in
all
my
holy
mountain

says
Jehovah
1
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
The
heavens
are
my
throne
and
the
earth
is
my
footstool
Where
then
is
the
house
that
you
could
build
for
me
And
where
is
my
resting-place

2
My
own
hand
has
made
all
these
things
And
this
is
how
they
all
came
to
be

declares
Jehovah
To
this
one
then
I
will
look
To
the
one
humble
and
broken
in
spirit
who
trembles
at
my
word

3
The
one
slaughtering
the
bull
is
like
one
striking
down
a
man
The
one
sacrificing
a
sheep
is
like
one
breaking
the
neck
of
a
dog
The
one
offering
a
gift—like
the
blood
of
a
pig
The
one
presenting
a
memorial
offering
of
frankincense
is
like
one
saying
a
blessing
with
magical
words
They
have
chosen
their
own
ways
And
they
take
delight
in
what
is
disgusting

4
So
I
will
choose
ways
to
punish
them
And
the
very
things
they
dread
I
will
bring
upon
them
Because
when
I
called
no
one
answered
When
I
spoke
there
were
none
who
listened
They
kept
doing
what
was
bad
in
my
eyes
And
they
chose
to
do
what
displeased
me

5
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
you
who
tremble
at
his
word
Your
brothers
who
hate
you
and
exclude
you
because
of
my
name
said
May
Jehovah
be
glorified
But
He
will
appear
and
bring
you
joy
And
they
are
the
ones
who
will
be
put
to
shame

There
is
a
sound
of
uproar
from
the
city
a
sound
from
the
temple
It
is
the
sound
of
Jehovah
repaying
his
enemies
what
they
deserve

7
Before
she
went
into
labor
she
gave
birth
Before
birth
pangs
came
to
her
she
delivered
a
male
child

8
Who
has
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
Who
has
seen
such
things
Will
a
land
be
brought
to
birth
in
one
day
Or
will
a
nation
be
born
all
at
once
Yet
as
soon
as
Zion
went
into
labor
she
gave
birth
to
her
sons

9
Will
I
bring
it
to
the
point
of
birth
and
then
not
bring
it
forth
says
Jehovah
Or
would
I
cause
the
birth
and
then
shut
the
womb
says
your
God
10
Rejoice
with
Jerusalem
and
be
joyful
with
her
all
you
who
love
her
Exult
greatly
with
her
all
you
who
are
in
mourning
over
her
11
For
you
will
nurse
and
be
fully
satisfied
from
her
breast
of
consolation
And
you
will
drink
deeply
and
find
delight
in
the
abundance
of
her
glory
12
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
extending
to
her
peace
just
like
a
riverAnd
the
glory
of
nations
like
a
flooding
torrent
You
will
nurse
and
be
carried
on
the
hip
And
you
will
be
bounced
on
the
knees
13
As
a
mother
comforts
her
son
So
I
will
keep
comforting
you
And
over
Jerusalem
you
will
be
comforted
14
You
will
see
this
and
your
heart
will
rejoice
Your
bones
will
flourish
just
like
new
grass
And
the
hand
of
Jehovah
will
become
known
to
his
servants
But
he
will
denounce
his
enemies
15
For
Jehovah
will
come
as
a
fire
And
his
chariots
are
like
a
storm
wind
To
repay
in
furious
anger
To
rebuke
with
flames
of
fire
16
For
with
fire
Jehovah
will
execute
judgment
Yes
with
his
sword
against
all
flesh
And
the
slain
of
Jehovah
will
be
many
17
Those
sanctifying
themselves
and
cleansing
themselves
to
enter
the
gardens
following
one
who
is
in
the
center
those
eating
the
flesh
of
pigs
and
loathsome
things
and
mice
they
will
all
come
to
their
end
together

declares
Jehovah
18
Since
I
know
about
their
works
and
their
thoughts
I
am
coming
to
gather
people
of
all
nations
and
languages
and
they
will
come
and
see
my
glory
19
I
will
set
a
sign
among
them
and
I
will
send
some
of
those
who
escape
to
the
nations—to
Tarshish
Pul
and
Lud
those
who
draw
the
bow
to
Tubal
and
Javan
and
to
the
faraway
islands—who
have
not
heard
a
report
about
me
or
seen
my
glory
and
they
will
proclaim
my
glory
among
the
nations
20
They
will
bring
all
your
brothers
out
of
all
the
nations
as
a
gift
to
Jehovah
on
horses
in
chariots
in
covered
wagons
on
mules
and
on
swift
camels
up
to
my
holy
mountain
Jerusalem

says
Jehovah
just
as
when
the
people
of
Israel
bring
their
gift
in
a
clean
vessel
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
21
I
will
also
take
some
for
the
priests
and
for
the
Levites

says
Jehovah
22
For
just
as
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
that
I
am
making
will
remain
standing
before
me

declares
Jehovah
so
your
offspring
and
your
name
will
remain
23
And
from
new
moon
to
new
moon
and
from
sabbath
to
sabbath
All
flesh
will
come
in
to
bow
down
before
me

says
Jehovah
24
And
they
will
go
out
and
look
on
the
carcasses
of
the
men
who
rebelled
against
me
For
the
worms
on
them
will
not
die
And
their
fire
will
not
be
extinguished
And
they
will
become
something
repulsive
to
all
people
1
These
are
the
words
of
Jeremiah
the
son
of
Hilkiah
one
of
the
priests
in
Anathoth
in
the
land
of
Benjamin
2
The
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
him
in
the
days
of
Josiah
the
son
of
Amon
the
king
of
Judah
in
the
13th
year
of
his
reign
3
It
came
also
in
the
days
of
Jehoiakim
the
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
until
the
completion
of
the
11th
year
of
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
until
Jerusalem
went
into
exile
in
the
fifth
month
4
The
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying

5
Before
I
formed
you
in
the
womb
I
knew
you
And
before
you
were
born
I
sanctified
you
I
made
you
a
prophet
to
the
nations

6
But
I
said
Alas
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
I
do
not
know
how
to
speak
for
I
am
just
a
boy

7
Jehovah
then
said
to
me
Do
not
say
I
am
just
a
boy
For
you
must
go
to
all
those
to
whom
I
send
you
And
you
should
say
everything
that
I
command
you

8
Do
not
be
afraid
because
of
their
appearance
For
I
am
with
you
to
save
you

declares
Jehovah
9
Then
Jehovah
stretched
out
his
hand
and
touched
my
mouth
And
Jehovah
said
to
me
I
have
put
my
words
in
your
mouth
10
See
I
have
commissioned
you
this
day
to
be
over
the
nations
and
over
the
kingdoms
to
uproot
and
to
pull
down
to
destroy
and
to
tear
down
to
build
and
to
plant
11
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
What
do
you
see
Jeremiah
So
I
said
I
see
the
branch
of
an
almond
tree
12
Jehovah
said
to
me
You
have
seen
correctly
for
I
am
wide
awake
concerning
my
word
to
carry
it
out
13
The
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
a
second
time
saying
What
do
you
see
So
I
said
I
see
a
boiling
pot
and
its
mouth
is
tilted
away
from
the
north
14
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
Out
of
the
north
the
calamity
will
break
looseAgainst
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
15
For
I
am
summoning
all
the
families
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
north

declares
Jehovah
And
they
will
come
each
one
will
set
up
his
throneAt
the
entrance
of
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
Against
her
walls
all
aroundAnd
against
all
the
cities
of
Judah
16
And
I
will
declare
my
judgments
against
them
over
all
their
wickedness
Because
they
have
abandoned
me
And
they
are
making
sacrificial
smoke
to
other
godsAnd
bowing
down
to
the
works
of
their
own
hands
17
But
you
should
prepare
for
action
And
you
must
stand
up
and
tell
them
everything
that
I
command
you
Do
not
be
terrified
of
them
So
that
I
do
not
terrify
you
before
them
18
For
today
I
have
made
you
a
fortified
city
An
iron
pillar
and
copper
walls
against
all
the
land
Toward
the
kings
of
Judah
and
her
princes
Toward
her
priests
and
the
people
of
the
land
19
And
they
will
certainly
fight
against
you
But
they
will
not
prevail
against
you
For
I
am
with
you

declares
Jehovah
to
save
you
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
2
Go
and
proclaim
in
the
ears
of
Jerusalem
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
well
remember
the
devotion
of
your
youth
The
love
you
showed
when
you
were
engaged
to
marry
How
you
followed
me
in
the
wilderness
In
a
land
not
sown
with
seed

3
Israel
was
holy
to
Jehovah
the
firstfruits
of
his
harvest
Anyone
devouring
him
would
become
guilty
Disaster
would
come
upon
them

declares
Jehovah

4
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
O
house
of
Jacob
And
all
you
families
of
the
house
of
Israel

5
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
What
fault
did
your
forefathers
find
in
me
So
that
they
strayed
so
far
from
me
And
they
walked
after
worthless
idols
and
became
worthless
themselves

6
They
did
not
ask
Where
is
Jehovah
The
One
who
brought
us
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
Who
led
us
through
the
wilderness
Through
a
land
of
deserts
and
pits
Through
a
land
of
drought
and
of
deep
shadow
Through
a
land
where
no
man
travelsAnd
where
no
humans
dwell

7
I
then
brought
you
to
a
land
of
orchards
To
eat
its
fruitage
and
its
good
things
But
you
came
in
and
defiled
my
land
You
made
my
inheritance
something
detestable

8
The
priests
did
not
ask
Where
is
Jehovah
Those
handling
the
Law
did
not
know
me
The
shepherds
rebelled
against
me
The
prophets
prophesied
by
Baal
And
they
followed
those
who
could
bring
no
benefit

9
So
I
will
contend
further
with
you

declares
Jehovah
And
I
will
contend
with
the
sons
of
your
sons
10
But
cross
over
to
the
coastlands
of
the
Kittim
and
see
Yes
send
to
Kedar
and
consider
carefully
See
whether
anything
like
this
has
happened
11
Has
a
nation
ever
changed
its
gods
for
those
that
are
not
gods
But
my
own
people
have
exchanged
my
glory
for
what
is
useless
12
Stare
in
amazement
at
this
you
heavens
Shudder
in
absolute
horror

declares
Jehovah
13
Because
my
people
have
done
two
bad
things
They
have
abandoned
me
the
source
of
living
water
And
dug
for
themselves
cisterns
Broken
cisterns
that
cannot
hold
water
14
Is
Israel
a
servant
or
a
slave
born
in
the
household
Then
why
has
he
been
given
over
to
plunder
15
Against
him
young
lions
roar
They
have
raised
their
voice
They
made
his
land
an
object
of
horror
His
cities
have
been
set
on
fire
so
that
there
is
no
inhabitant
16
The
people
of
Noph
and
Tahpanes
feed
on
the
crown
of
your
head
17
Have
you
not
brought
this
on
yourselfBy
abandoning
Jehovah
your
GodWhile
he
was
leading
you
in
the
way
18
Now
why
do
you
wish
for
the
way
to
EgyptTo
drink
the
waters
of
Shihor
Why
do
you
wish
for
the
way
to
AssyriaTo
drink
the
waters
of
the
River
19
Your
wickedness
should
correct
you
And
your
own
unfaithfulness
should
reprove
you
Know
and
realize
how
bad
and
bitter
it
isTo
abandon
Jehovah
your
God
You
have
shown
no
fear
of
me

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
20
For
long
ago
I
smashed
your
yokeAnd
tore
off
your
shackles
But
you
said
I
am
not
going
to
serve

For
on
every
high
hill
and
under
every
luxuriant
treeYou
were
lying
sprawled
out
prostituting
yourself
21
I
planted
you
as
a
choice
red
vine
all
of
it
pure
seed
So
how
have
you
turned
into
the
degenerate
shoots
of
a
foreign
vine
before
me
22
Though
you
should
wash
with
soda
and
use
much
lye
Your
guilt
would
still
be
a
stain
before
me

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
23
How
can
you
say
I
have
not
defiled
myself
I
have
not
followed
the
Baals
Look
at
your
way
in
the
valley
Consider
what
you
have
done
You
are
like
a
swift
young
she-camel
Aimlessly
running
back
and
forth
in
her
ways
24
A
wild
donkey
accustomed
to
the
wilderness
Sniffing
the
wind
in
her
lust
Who
can
restrain
her
when
she
is
in
heat
None
of
those
looking
for
her
will
need
to
weary
themselves
In
her
season
they
will
find
her
25
Keep
your
feet
from
going
bareAnd
your
throat
from
thirst
But
you
said
It
is
hopeless
No
I
have
fallen
in
love
with
strangers
And
I
will
follow
them
26
Like
the
shame
of
a
thief
when
he
is
caught
So
the
house
of
Israel
has
been
put
to
shame
They
their
kings
and
their
princes
Their
priests
and
their
prophets
27
They
say
to
a
tree
You
are
my
father

And
to
a
stone
You
gave
birth
to
me
But
to
me
they
turn
their
back
and
not
their
face
And
in
the
time
of
their
calamity
they
will
say
Rise
up
and
save
us
28
Now
where
are
your
gods
that
you
made
for
yourself
Let
them
rise
up
if
they
can
save
you
in
your
time
of
calamity
For
your
gods
have
become
as
numerous
as
your
cities
O
Judah
29
Why
do
you
keep
contending
against
me
Why
have
all
of
you
rebelled
against
me
declares
Jehovah
30
I
have
struck
your
sons
in
vain
They
would
accept
no
discipline
Your
own
sword
devoured
your
prophets
Like
a
marauding
lion
31
O
generation
consider
for
yourselves
the
word
of
Jehovah
Have
I
become
like
a
wilderness
to
IsraelOr
a
land
of
oppressive
darkness
Why
have
these
my
people
said
We
roam
freely
We
will
come
to
you
no
more
32
Can
a
virgin
forget
her
ornaments
A
bride
her
breastbands
And
yet
my
own
people
have
forgotten
me
for
countless
days
33
How
skillfully
O
woman
you
set
your
course
to
seek
love
You
have
trained
yourself
in
the
ways
of
wickedness
34
Even
your
skirts
are
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
innocent
poor
ones
Though
I
did
not
find
them
in
the
act
of
breaking
in
It
is
on
all
your
skirts
35
But
you
say
I
am
innocent
Surely
his
anger
has
turned
back
from
me
Now
I
am
bringing
judgment
against
youBecause
you
say
I
have
not
sinned
36
Why
do
you
treat
so
lightly
your
unstable
course
You
will
become
ashamed
of
Egypt
too
Just
as
you
became
ashamed
of
Assyria
37
For
this
reason
also
you
will
go
out
with
your
hands
on
your
head
For
Jehovah
has
rejected
those
in
whom
you
put
confidence
They
will
not
bring
you
success
1
People
ask
If
a
man
sends
his
wife
away
and
she
leaves
him
and
becomes
another
mans
should
he
return
to
her
anymore
Has
that
land
not
been
utterly
polluted
You
have
committed
prostitution
with
many
companions
And
should
you
now
return
to
me
declares
Jehovah

2
Raise
your
eyes
to
the
bare
hills
and
see
Where
have
you
not
been
raped
You
sat
along
the
roadways
for
them
Like
a
nomad
in
the
wilderness
You
keep
polluting
the
landWith
your
prostitution
and
your
wickedness

3
So
showers
of
rain
are
withheld
And
there
is
no
rain
in
the
spring
You
have
the
brazen
look
of
a
wife
who
commits
prostitution
You
refuse
to
feel
shame

4
But
now
you
call
out
to
me
My
Father
you
are
the
companion
of
my
youth

5
Should
one
stay
resentful
forever
Or
always
hold
a
grudge
This
is
what
you
say
But
you
keep
doing
all
the
evil
you
are
capable
of
doing
6
In
the
days
of
King
Josiah
Jehovah
said
to
me
Have
you
seen
what
unfaithful
Israel
has
done
She
has
gone
up
on
every
high
mountain
and
underneath
every
luxuriant
tree
to
commit
prostitution
7
Even
after
she
did
all
these
things
I
kept
telling
her
to
return
to
me
but
she
did
not
return
and
Judah
kept
watching
her
treacherous
sister
8
When
I
saw
that
I
sent
unfaithful
Israel
away
with
a
full
certificate
of
divorce
because
of
her
adultery
But
her
treacherous
sister
Judah
did
not
become
afraid
she
too
went
out
and
committed
prostitution
9
She
took
her
prostitution
lightly
and
she
kept
polluting
the
land
and
committing
adultery
with
stones
and
with
trees
10
Despite
all
this
her
treacherous
sister
Judah
did
not
return
to
me
with
all
her
heart
only
in
pretense

declares
Jehovah
11
Jehovah
then
said
to
me
Unfaithful
Israel
has
shown
herself
to
be
more
righteous
than
treacherous
Judah
12
Go
and
proclaim
these
words
to
the
north
Return
O
renegade
Israel

declares
Jehovah
I
will
not
look
down
angrily
on
you
for
I
am
loyal

declares
Jehovah
I
will
not
stay
resentful
forever
13
Only
acknowledge
your
guilt
for
you
have
rebelled
against
Jehovah
your
God
You
continued
scattering
your
favors
to
strangers
under
every
luxuriant
tree
but
you
would
not
obey
my
voice

declares
Jehovah
14
Return
you
renegade
sons

declares
Jehovah
For
I
have
become
your
true
master
and
I
will
take
you
one
from
a
city
and
two
from
a
family
and
I
will
bring
you
to
Zion
15
And
I
will
give
you
shepherds
after
my
own
heart
and
they
will
feed
you
with
knowledge
and
insight
16
You
will
become
many
and
will
bear
fruit
in
the
land
in
those
days

declares
Jehovah
No
more
will
they
say
The
ark
of
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
It
will
not
come
up
into
the
heart
nor
will
they
remember
it
or
miss
it
and
it
will
not
be
made
again
17
At
that
time
they
will
call
Jerusalem
the
throne
of
Jehovah
and
all
the
nations
will
be
brought
together
to
the
name
of
Jehovah
at
Jerusalem
and
they
will
no
longer
stubbornly
follow
their
own
wicked
heart
18
In
those
days
they
will
walk
together
the
house
of
Judah
alongside
the
house
of
Israel
and
together
they
will
come
from
the
land
of
the
north
into
the
land
that
I
gave
to
your
forefathers
as
an
inheritance
19
And
I
thought
How
I
placed
you
among
the
sons
and
gave
you
the
desirable
land
the
most
beautiful
inheritance
among
the
nations
I
also
thought
that
you
would
call
me
My
Father
and
that
you
would
not
turn
away
from
following
me
20
Truly
as
a
wife
treacherously
leaves
her
husband
so
also
you
O
house
of
Israel
have
dealt
treacherously
with
me

declares
Jehovah
21
On
the
bare
hills
a
sound
is
heard
The
weeping
and
the
pleading
of
the
people
of
Israel
For
they
have
distorted
their
way
They
have
forgotten
Jehovah
their
God
22
Return
you
renegade
sons
I
will
heal
your
renegade
condition
Here
we
are
We
have
come
to
you
For
you
O
Jehovah
are
our
God
23
Truly
the
hills
and
the
turmoil
on
the
mountains
are
a
delusion
Truly
in
Jehovah
our
God
is
the
salvation
of
Israel
24
But
the
shameful
thing
has
consumed
the
toil
of
our
forefathers
since
our
youth
Their
flocks
and
their
herds
Their
sons
and
their
daughters
25
Let
us
lie
down
in
our
shame
And
let
our
disgrace
cover
us
For
we
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
our
God
We
and
our
fathers
since
our
youth
until
this
day
And
we
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
Jehovah
our
God
1
If
you
will
return
O
Israel

declares
Jehovah
If
you
will
return
to
meAnd
if
you
will
remove
your
disgusting
idols
from
before
me
Then
you
will
not
be
a
fugitive

2
And
if
you
swear
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
in
truth
justice
and
righteousness
Then
the
nations
will
obtain
a
blessing
for
themselves
by
him
And
in
him
they
will
boast
3
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
to
the
men
of
Judah
and
to
Jerusalem
Plow
for
yourselves
arable
land
And
do
not
keep
sowing
among
thorns

4
Circumcise
yourselves
to
Jehovah
And
remove
the
foreskins
of
your
hearts
You
men
of
Judah
and
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
So
that
my
wrath
may
not
blaze
up
like
a
fireAnd
burn
with
no
one
to
extinguish
it
Because
of
your
evil
deeds

5
Declare
it
in
Judah
and
proclaim
it
in
Jerusalem
Shout
and
blow
a
horn
throughout
the
land
Call
out
loudly
and
say
Gather
together
And
let
us
flee
into
the
fortified
cities

6
Raise
a
signal
toward
Zion
Seek
shelter
and
do
not
stand
still

For
I
am
bringing
in
calamity
from
the
north
a
great
crash

7
He
has
emerged
like
a
lion
from
his
thicket
The
destroyer
of
nations
has
set
out
He
has
gone
out
from
his
place
to
make
your
land
an
object
of
horror
Your
cities
will
be
reduced
to
ruins
without
an
inhabitant

8
Therefore
put
on
sackcloth
Mourn
and
wail
Because
the
burning
anger
of
Jehovah
has
not
turned
away
from
us

9
In
that
day

declares
Jehovah
the
heart
of
the
king
will
fail
him
Also
the
heart
of
the
princes
The
priests
will
be
horrified
and
the
prophets
will
be
amazed
10
Then
I
said
Alas
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Truly
you
have
utterly
deceived
this
people
and
Jerusalem
saying
You
will
have
peace

when
the
sword
is
at
our
throats
11
At
that
time
it
will
be
said
to
this
people
and
to
Jerusalem
A
scorching
wind
from
the
barren
hills
of
the
desertWill
sweep
down
on
the
daughter
of
my
people
It
is
not
coming
to
winnow
or
to
cleanse
12
The
full
wind
comes
from
these
places
at
my
bidding
Now
I
will
pronounce
judgments
against
them
13
Look
He
will
come
like
rain
clouds
And
his
chariots
are
like
a
storm
wind
His
horses
are
swifter
than
eagles
Woe
to
us
for
we
are
ruined
14
Wash
your
heart
clean
of
wickedness
O
Jerusalem
in
order
to
be
saved
How
long
will
you
harbor
wicked
thoughts
15
For
a
voice
tells
the
news
from
Dan
And
it
proclaims
disaster
from
the
mountains
of
Ephraim
16
Report
it
yes
to
the
nations
Proclaim
it
against
Jerusalem
Sentinels
are
coming
from
a
distant
land
And
they
will
raise
their
voices
against
the
cities
of
Judah
17
They
come
against
her
on
all
sides
like
guards
of
the
open
field
Because
she
has
rebelled
against
me

declares
Jehovah
18
Your
own
ways
and
your
actions
will
be
brought
upon
you
How
bitter
is
your
disaster
For
it
reaches
clear
to
your
heart
19
O
my
anguish
my
anguish
I
feel
great
pain
in
my
very
heart
My
heart
pounds
within
me
I
cannot
keep
silent
For
I
have
heard
the
sound
of
the
horn
The
alarm
signal
of
war
20
Disaster
after
disaster
has
been
reported
For
the
whole
land
has
been
destroyed
Suddenly
my
own
tents
are
destroyed
In
a
moment
my
tent
cloths
21
How
long
will
I
keep
seeing
the
signal
Keep
hearing
the
sound
of
the
horn
22
For
my
people
are
foolish
They
take
no
note
of
me
They
are
stupid
sons
with
no
understanding
They
are
clever
enough
when
it
comes
to
doing
bad
But
they
do
not
know
how
to
do
good
23
I
saw
the
land
and
look
it
was
empty
and
desolate
I
looked
at
the
heavens
and
their
light
was
no
more
24
I
saw
the
mountains
and
look
they
were
quaking
And
the
hills
were
shaking
25
I
saw
and
look
there
was
no
man
And
the
birds
of
the
heavens
had
all
fled
26
I
saw
and
look
the
orchard
had
become
a
wilderness
And
its
cities
had
all
been
torn
down
It
was
because
of
Jehovah
Because
of
his
burning
anger
27
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
The
whole
land
will
become
desolate
But
I
will
not
carry
out
a
complete
extermination
28
For
this
reason
the
land
will
mourn
And
the
heavens
above
will
become
dark
It
is
because
I
have
spoken
I
have
decided
And
I
will
not
change
my
mind
nor
will
I
turn
back
from
it
29
At
the
sound
of
the
horsemen
and
the
archers
The
entire
city
flees
They
enter
into
the
thickets
And
they
climb
the
rocks
Every
city
is
abandoned
And
no
man
dwells
in
them
30
Now
that
you
are
devastated
what
will
you
do
You
used
to
clothe
yourself
with
scarlet
To
deck
yourself
with
gold
ornaments
And
to
enlarge
your
eyes
with
black
paint
But
it
is
in
vain
that
you
beautified
yourself
For
those
lusting
after
you
have
rejected
you
They
are
now
seeking
to
take
your
life
31
For
I
have
heard
the
sound
like
that
of
a
sick
woman
The
distress
like
that
of
a
woman
giving
birth
to
her
first
child
The
voice
of
the
daughter
of
Zion
who
keeps
gasping
for
breath
She
says
as
she
spreads
out
her
palms
Woe
to
me
for
I
am
exhausted
because
of
the
killers
1
Roam
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
Look
around
and
take
note
Search
her
public
squares
to
seeWhether
you
can
find
a
man
who
acts
with
justice
One
who
seeks
to
be
faithful
And
I
will
forgive
her

2
Even
if
they
say
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
They
would
still
swear
to
what
is
false

3
O
Jehovah
do
your
eyes
not
look
for
faithfulness
You
struck
them
but
it
made
no
impact
on
them
You
exterminated
them
but
they
refused
to
accept
discipline
They
made
their
faces
harder
than
a
rock
And
they
refused
to
turn
around

4
But
I
said
to
myself
Surely
these
must
be
the
lowly
They
act
foolishly
for
they
do
not
know
the
way
of
Jehovah
The
judgment
of
their
God

5
I
will
go
to
the
prominent
men
and
speak
with
them
For
they
must
have
taken
note
of
the
way
of
Jehovah
The
judgment
of
their
God
But
they
had
all
broken
the
yokeAnd
torn
apart
the
restraints

6
That
is
why
a
lion
of
the
forest
attacks
them
A
wolf
of
the
desert
plains
keeps
ravaging
them
A
leopard
lies
awake
at
their
cities
Everyone
going
out
from
them
is
torn
to
pieces
For
their
transgressions
are
many
Their
acts
of
unfaithfulness
are
numerous

7
How
can
I
forgive
you
for
this
Your
sons
have
abandoned
me
And
they
swear
by
what
is
no
God
I
satisfied
their
needs
But
they
kept
committing
adultery
And
they
flocked
to
the
house
of
a
prostitute

8
They
are
like
eager
lustful
horses
Each
neighing
after
another
mans
wife

9
Should
I
not
call
them
to
account
for
these
things
declares
Jehovah
Should
I
not
avenge
myself
on
such
a
nation
10
Come
up
against
her
vineyard
terraces
and
bring
ruin
But
do
not
make
a
complete
extermination
Take
away
her
spreading
shoots
For
they
do
not
belong
to
Jehovah
11
For
the
house
of
Israel
and
the
house
of
JudahHave
been
utterly
treacherous
with
me

declares
Jehovah
12
They
have
denied
Jehovah
and
they
keep
saying
He
will
do
nothing
No
calamity
will
come
upon
us
We
will
not
see
sword
or
famine
13
The
prophets
are
full
of
wind
And
the
word
is
not
in
them
Let
this
happen
to
them
14
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
says
Because
these
men
are
saying
this
Here
I
am
making
my
words
a
fire
in
your
mouth
And
this
people
is
the
wood
And
it
will
consume
them
15
Here
I
am
bringing
in
on
you
a
nation
from
far
away
O
house
of
Israel

declares
Jehovah
It
is
an
enduring
nation
It
is
an
ancient
nation
A
nation
whose
language
you
do
not
know
And
whose
speech
you
cannot
understand
16
Their
quiver
is
like
an
open
grave
All
of
them
are
warriors
17
They
will
devour
your
harvest
and
your
bread
They
will
devour
your
sons
and
your
daughters
They
will
devour
your
flocks
and
your
herds
They
will
devour
your
vines
and
your
fig
trees
They
will
destroy
with
the
sword
your
fortified
cities
in
which
you
trust
18
But
even
in
those
days

declares
Jehovah
I
will
not
carry
out
a
complete
extermination
of
you
19
And
when
they
ask
Why
has
Jehovah
our
God
done
all
these
things
to
us
you
should
answer
them
Just
as
you
abandoned
me
to
serve
a
foreign
god
in
your
land
so
you
will
serve
foreigners
in
a
land
that
is
not
yours
20
Declare
this
in
the
house
of
Jacob
And
proclaim
it
in
Judah
saying
21
Hear
this
you
foolish
and
senseless
people
They
have
eyes
but
cannot
see
They
have
ears
but
cannot
hear
22
Do
you
not
fear
me
declares
Jehovah
Should
you
not
tremble
before
me
It
is
I
who
placed
the
sand
as
the
boundary
for
the
sea
A
permanent
regulation
that
it
cannot
pass
over
Although
its
waves
toss
they
cannot
prevail
Although
they
roar
they
still
cannot
pass
beyond
it
23
But
this
people
has
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
heart
They
have
turned
aside
and
gone
their
own
way
24
And
they
do
not
say
in
their
heart
Let
us
now
fear
Jehovah
our
God
The
One
who
gives
the
rain
in
its
season
Both
the
autumn
rain
and
the
spring
rain
The
One
who
guards
for
us
the
appointed
weeks
of
the
harvest
25
Your
own
errors
have
prevented
these
things
from
coming
Your
own
sins
have
deprived
you
of
what
is
good
26
For
among
my
people
there
are
wicked
men
They
keep
peering
as
when
birdcatchers
crouch
down
They
set
a
deadly
trap
It
is
men
whom
they
catch
27
Like
a
cage
full
of
birds
So
their
houses
are
full
of
deception
That
is
why
they
have
become
powerful
and
rich
28
They
have
grown
fat
and
smooth
They
overflow
with
evil
They
do
not
plead
the
legal
case
of
the
fatherless
That
they
may
gain
success
And
they
deny
justice
to
the
poor
29
Should
I
not
call
them
to
account
for
these
things
declares
Jehovah
Should
I
not
avenge
myself
on
such
a
nation
30
Something
appalling
and
horrible
has
occurred
in
the
land
31
The
prophets
prophesy
lies
And
the
priests
dominate
by
their
own
authority
And
my
own
people
love
it
that
way
But
what
will
you
do
when
the
end
comes
1
Take
shelter
O
sons
of
Benjamin
away
from
Jerusalem
Blow
the
horn
in
Tekoa
Light
a
fire
signal
over
Beth-haccherem
For
a
calamity
looms
from
the
north
a
great
disaster

2
The
daughter
of
Zion
resembles
a
beautiful
and
delicate
woman

3
The
shepherds
and
their
droves
will
come
They
will
pitch
their
tents
all
around
her
Each
grazing
the
flock
in
his
care

4
Prepare
for
war
against
her
Rise
up
and
let
us
attack
her
at
midday
Woe
to
us
for
the
day
is
declining
For
the
shadows
of
evening
are
getting
longer

5
Rise
up
and
let
us
attack
during
the
nightAnd
destroy
her
fortified
towers

6
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Cut
down
wood
and
raise
up
a
siege
rampart
against
Jerusalem
She
is
the
city
that
must
be
held
to
account
There
is
nothing
but
oppression
within
her

7
As
a
cistern
keeps
its
water
cool
So
she
keeps
her
wickedness
cool
Violence
and
destruction
are
heard
in
her
Sickness
and
plague
are
constantly
before
me

8
Be
warned
O
Jerusalem
or
I
will
turn
away
from
you
in
disgust
I
will
make
you
desolate
a
land
without
inhabitants

9
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
They
will
thoroughly
glean
the
remnant
of
Israel
as
the
last
grapes
on
a
vine
Pass
your
hand
again
like
one
gathering
grapes
from
the
vines
10
To
whom
should
I
speak
and
give
warning
Who
will
listen
Look
Their
ears
are
closed
so
that
they
are
unable
to
pay
attention
Look
The
word
of
Jehovah
has
become
something
they
scorn
They
find
no
pleasure
in
it
11
So
I
am
filled
with
the
wrath
of
Jehovah
And
I
am
tired
of
holding
it
in
Pour
it
out
on
the
child
in
the
street
On
the
groups
of
young
men
gathered
together
They
will
all
be
captured
a
man
along
with
his
wife
The
old
men
along
with
the
very
old
12
Their
houses
will
be
turned
over
to
others
Together
with
their
fields
and
their
wives
For
I
will
stretch
my
hand
out
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
land

declares
Jehovah
13
For
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
each
one
is
making
dishonest
gain
From
the
prophet
to
the
priest
each
one
is
practicing
fraud
14
And
they
try
to
heal
the
breakdown
of
my
people
lightly
saying
There
is
peace
There
is
peace
When
there
is
no
peace
15
Do
they
feel
ashamed
of
the
detestable
things
they
have
done
They
feel
no
shame
at
all
They
do
not
even
know
how
to
feel
humiliated
So
they
will
fall
among
the
fallen
When
I
bring
punishment
on
them
they
will
stumble

says
Jehovah
16
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Stand
at
the
crossroads
and
see
Ask
about
the
ancient
roadways
Ask
where
the
good
way
is
and
walk
in
it
And
find
rest
for
yourselves
But
they
say
We
will
not
walk
in
it
17
And
I
appointed
watchmen
who
said
Pay
attention
to
the
sound
of
the
horn
But
they
said
We
will
not
pay
attention
18
Therefore
hear
O
nations
And
know
O
assembly
What
will
happen
to
them
19
Listen
O
earth
I
am
bringing
calamity
on
this
peopleAs
the
fruitage
of
their
own
schemes
For
they
paid
no
attention
to
my
wordsAnd
they
rejected
my
law
20
What
do
I
care
that
you
bring
frankincense
from
ShebaAnd
sweet
cane
from
a
distant
land
Your
whole
burnt
offerings
are
not
acceptable
And
your
sacrifices
do
not
please
me
21
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
setting
for
this
people
stumbling
blocks
And
they
will
stumble
over
them
Fathers
and
sons
together
A
neighbor
and
his
companion
And
they
will
all
perish
22
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Look
A
people
is
coming
from
the
land
of
the
north
And
a
great
nation
will
be
awakened
from
the
remotest
parts
of
the
earth
23
They
will
grab
hold
of
the
bow
and
the
javelin
They
are
cruel
and
will
have
no
mercy
Their
voice
will
roar
like
the
sea
And
they
ride
on
horses
They
draw
up
in
battle
order
like
a
man
of
war
against
you
O
daughter
of
Zion
24
We
have
heard
the
report
about
it
Our
hands
fall
limp
Distress
has
seized
us
Anguish
like
that
of
a
woman
giving
birth
25
Do
not
go
out
into
the
field
And
do
not
walk
on
the
road
For
the
enemy
has
a
sword
There
is
terror
all
around
26
O
daughter
of
my
people
Put
on
sackcloth
and
roll
in
the
ashes
Mourn
as
for
an
only
son
with
bitter
wailing
For
suddenly
the
destroyer
will
come
upon
us
27
I
have
made
you
a
metal
tester
among
my
people
One
making
a
thorough
search
You
must
take
note
and
examine
their
way
28
All
of
them
are
the
most
stubborn
men
Walking
about
as
slanderers
They
are
like
copper
and
iron
All
of
them
are
corrupt
29
The
bellows
have
been
scorched
Out
from
their
fire
there
is
lead
One
keeps
refining
intensely
simply
for
nothing
And
those
who
are
bad
have
not
been
separated
30
Rejected
silver
is
what
people
will
certainly
call
them
For
Jehovah
has
rejected
them
1
This
is
the
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
2
Stand
in
the
gate
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
proclaim
there
this
message
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
all
you
people
of
Judah
who
enter
these
gates
to
bow
down
to
Jehovah
3
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Reform
your
ways
and
your
actions
and
I
will
allow
you
to
keep
residing
in
this
place
4
Do
not
put
your
trust
in
deceptive
words
and
say
This
is
the
temple
of
Jehovah
the
temple
of
Jehovah
the
temple
of
Jehovah
5
For
if
you
truly
reform
your
ways
and
actions
if
you
truly
uphold
justice
between
a
man
and
his
neighbor
6
if
you
do
not
oppress
foreign
residents
orphans
and
widows
if
you
do
not
shed
innocent
blood
in
this
place
and
if
you
do
not
follow
other
gods
to
your
own
harm
7
then
I
will
allow
you
to
keep
residing
in
this
place
in
the
land
I
gave
to
your
forefathers
for
all
time
8
But
you
are
putting
your
trust
in
deceptive
words—it
will
bring
absolutely
no
benefit
9
Can
you
steal
murder
commit
adultery
swear
falsely
make
sacrifices
to
Baal
and
follow
after
gods
you
had
not
known
10
and
then
come
and
stand
before
me
in
this
house
that
bears
my
name
and
say
We
will
be
saved

despite
your
doing
all
these
detestable
things
11
Has
this
house
that
bears
my
name
become
a
cave
of
robbers
in
your
eyes
Here
I
have
seen
it
for
myself

declares
Jehovah
12
However
go
now
to
my
place
in
Shiloh
where
I
first
caused
my
name
to
reside
and
see
what
I
did
to
it
because
of
the
badness
of
my
people
Israel
13
But
you
kept
doing
all
these
things

declares
Jehovah
and
even
though
I
spoke
to
you
again
and
again
you
did
not
listen
I
kept
calling
you
but
you
would
not
answer
14
So
I
will
do
to
the
house
that
bears
my
name
in
which
you
are
trusting
and
to
this
place
that
I
gave
to
you
and
your
forefathers
just
as
I
did
to
Shiloh
15
I
will
throw
you
out
of
my
sight
just
as
I
threw
out
all
your
brothers
all
the
descendants
of
Ephraim
16
As
for
you
do
not
pray
in
behalf
of
this
people
Do
not
cry
out
or
offer
a
prayer
or
plead
with
me
in
their
behalf
for
I
will
not
listen
to
you
17
Do
you
not
see
what
they
are
doing
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
18
The
sons
are
gathering
wood
the
fathers
are
lighting
the
fire
and
the
wives
are
kneading
dough
in
order
to
make
sacrificial
cakes
to
the
Queen
of
Heaven
and
they
are
pouring
out
drink
offerings
to
other
gods
to
offend
me
19
But
am
I
the
one
they
are
hurting
declares
Jehovah
Is
it
not
they
themselves
to
their
own
shame
20
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Look
My
anger
and
my
wrath
will
be
poured
out
on
this
place
on
man
and
beast
on
the
trees
of
the
field
and
the
fruitage
of
the
ground
it
will
burn
and
will
not
be
extinguished
21
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Go
ahead
add
your
whole
burnt
offerings
to
your
other
sacrifices
and
eat
the
flesh
yourselves
22
For
on
the
day
I
brought
your
forefathers
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
I
did
not
speak
with
them
or
command
them
concerning
whole
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
23
But
I
did
give
them
this
command
Obey
my
voice
and
I
will
become
your
God
and
you
will
become
my
people
You
must
walk
in
all
the
way
that
I
command
so
that
it
may
go
well
with
you
24
But
they
did
not
listen
or
incline
their
ear
instead
they
walked
in
their
own
schemes
stubbornly
following
their
wicked
heart
and
they
went
backward
not
forward
25
from
the
day
your
forefathers
came
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
until
this
day
So
I
kept
sending
all
my
servants
the
prophets
to
you
sending
them
each
day
again
and
again
26
But
they
refused
to
listen
to
me
and
they
did
not
incline
their
ear
Instead
they
were
stubborn
and
they
acted
worse
than
their
forefathers
27
You
will
speak
all
these
words
to
them
but
they
will
not
listen
to
you
you
will
call
to
them
but
they
will
not
answer
you
28
And
you
will
say
to
them
This
is
the
nation
that
did
not
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
their
God
and
refused
to
accept
discipline
Faithfulness
has
perished
and
is
not
even
mentioned
among
them
29
Shear
off
your
uncut
hair
and
throw
it
away
and
on
the
bare
hills
raise
a
dirge
for
Jehovah
has
rejected
and
will
abandon
this
generation
that
has
infuriated
him
30
For
the
people
of
Judah
have
done
what
is
bad
in
my
eyes

declares
Jehovah
They
have
set
up
their
disgusting
idols
in
the
house
that
bears
my
name
in
order
to
defile
it
31
They
have
built
the
high
places
of
Topheth
which
is
in
the
Valley
of
the
Son
of
Hinnom
in
order
to
burn
their
sons
and
their
daughters
in
the
fire
something
that
I
had
not
commanded
and
that
had
never
even
come
into
my
heart
32
Therefore
look
the
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
it
will
no
longer
be
called
Topheth
or
the
Valley
of
the
Son
of
Hinnom
but
the
Valley
of
the
Slaughter
They
will
bury
in
Topheth
until
there
is
no
place
left
33
And
the
dead
bodies
of
this
people
will
become
food
for
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth
with
no
one
to
frighten
them
away
34
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
sound
of
exultation
and
the
sound
of
rejoicing
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
for
the
land
will
be
reduced
to
ruins
1
At
that
time

declares
Jehovah
the
bones
of
the
kings
of
Judah
the
bones
of
its
princes
the
bones
of
the
priests
the
bones
of
the
prophets
and
the
bones
of
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
will
be
taken
from
their
graves
2
They
will
be
spread
out
to
the
sun
and
to
the
moon
and
to
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
that
they
loved
and
served
and
followed
and
sought
after
and
bowed
down
to
They
will
not
be
gathered
nor
will
they
be
buried
They
will
become
like
manure
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
3
And
the
remnant
of
this
evil
family
who
survive
will
choose
death
over
life
in
all
the
places
where
I
disperse
them

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
4
And
you
must
say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Will
they
fall
and
not
get
up
again
If
one
would
turn
back
will
the
other
not
also
turn
back

5
Why
is
this
people
Jerusalem
unfaithful
with
an
enduring
unfaithfulness
They
hold
fast
to
deception
They
refuse
to
turn
back

6
I
paid
attention
and
kept
listening
but
the
way
they
spoke
was
not
right
Not
a
man
repented
over
his
wickedness
or
asked
What
have
I
done
Each
one
keeps
returning
to
the
popular
course
like
a
horse
dashing
into
the
battle

7
Even
the
stork
in
the
sky
knows
its
seasons
The
turtledove
and
the
swift
and
the
thrush
keep
to
the
time
of
their
return
But
my
own
people
do
not
understand
the
judgment
of
Jehovah

8
How
can
you
say
We
are
wise
and
we
have
the
law
of
Jehovah
For
in
fact
the
lying
stylus
of
the
scribes
has
been
used
only
for
falsehood

9
The
wise
have
been
put
to
shame
They
have
become
terrified
and
will
be
caught
Look
They
have
rejected
the
word
of
Jehovah
And
what
wisdom
do
they
have
10
So
I
will
give
their
wives
to
other
men
Their
fields
to
other
owners
For
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
each
one
is
making
dishonest
gain
From
the
prophet
to
the
priest
each
one
is
practicing
fraud
11
And
they
try
to
heal
the
breakdown
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
lightly
saying
There
is
peace
There
is
peace
When
there
is
no
peace
12
Do
they
feel
ashamed
of
the
detestable
things
they
have
done
They
feel
no
shame
at
all
They
do
not
even
know
how
to
feel
humiliated
So
they
will
fall
among
the
fallen
When
I
bring
punishment
on
them
they
will
stumble

says
Jehovah
13
When
I
gather
them
I
will
bring
them
to
their
end

declares
Jehovah
There
will
be
no
grapes
left
on
the
vine
no
figs
on
the
fig
tree
and
the
leaves
will
wither
And
what
I
gave
to
them
will
be
lost
to
them
14
Why
are
we
sitting
here
Let
us
gather
together
and
enter
the
fortified
cities
and
perish
there
For
Jehovah
our
God
will
do
away
with
us
And
he
gives
us
poisoned
water
to
drink
Because
we
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
15
There
was
a
hope
for
peace
but
nothing
good
came
For
a
time
of
healing
but
there
is
terror
16
From
Dan
is
heard
the
snorting
of
his
horses
At
the
sound
of
the
neighing
of
his
stallions
The
whole
land
quakes
They
come
in
and
devour
the
land
and
everything
in
it
The
city
and
its
inhabitants
17
For
here
I
am
sending
in
serpents
among
you
Poisonous
snakes
that
cannot
be
charmed
And
they
will
certainly
bite
you

declares
Jehovah
18
My
grief
is
incurable
My
heart
is
sick
19
From
a
distant
land
there
is
a
cry
for
helpFrom
the
daughter
of
my
people
Is
Jehovah
not
in
Zion
Or
is
her
king
not
in
her
Why
have
they
offended
me
with
their
graven
images
With
their
worthless
foreign
gods
20
The
harvest
has
passed
the
summer
has
ended
But
we
have
not
been
saved
21
I
am
shattered
over
the
breakdown
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
I
am
dejected
Horror
has
seized
me
22
Is
there
no
balsam
in
Gilead
Or
is
there
no
healer
there
Why
has
the
daughter
of
my
people
not
been
restored
to
health
1
O
that
my
head
were
waters
My
eyes
a
fountain
of
tears
Then
I
would
weep
day
and
nightFor
the
slain
ones
of
my
people

2
O
that
I
had
a
travelers
lodging
place
in
the
wilderness
Then
I
would
leave
my
people
and
go
away
from
them
For
they
are
all
adulterers
A
band
of
treacherous
people

3
They
bend
their
tongue
like
a
bow
Falsehood
not
faithfulness
prevails
in
the
land
They
advance
from
evil
to
evil
And
they
pay
no
attention
to
me

declares
Jehovah

4
Everyone
be
on
guard
against
your
neighbor
And
do
not
trust
even
your
brother
For
every
brother
is
a
betrayer
And
every
neighbor
is
a
slanderer

5
Each
one
cheats
his
neighbor
And
no
one
speaks
truth
They
have
taught
their
tongue
to
speak
falsehood
They
wear
themselves
out
doing
what
is
wrong

6
You
are
living
in
the
midst
of
deception
In
their
deception
they
refused
to
know
me

declares
Jehovah

7
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
I
will
smelt
them
and
test
them
For
what
else
can
I
do
with
the
daughter
of
my
people

8
Their
tongue
is
a
deadly
arrow
that
speaks
deception
With
his
mouth
a
person
speaks
of
peace
to
his
neighbor
But
inside
he
lays
an
ambush

9
Should
I
not
call
them
to
account
for
these
things
declares
Jehovah
Should
I
not
avenge
myself
on
such
a
nation
10
I
will
weep
and
lament
over
the
mountainsAnd
take
up
a
dirge
over
the
pastures
of
the
wilderness
For
they
have
been
burned
up
so
that
no
man
passes
through
And
the
sound
of
livestock
is
not
heard
The
birds
of
heaven
and
the
beasts
have
fled
they
are
gone
11
I
will
make
Jerusalem
piles
of
stones
the
lair
of
jackals
And
I
will
make
the
cities
of
Judah
desolate
without
an
inhabitant
12
Who
is
wise
enough
to
understand
this
To
whom
has
the
mouth
of
Jehovah
spoken
that
he
may
declare
it
Why
has
the
land
perished
Why
is
it
scorched
like
the
wilderness
So
that
no
one
is
passing
through
13
Jehovah
replied
Because
of
their
rejecting
my
law
that
I
set
before
them
and
because
they
have
not
followed
it
and
obeyed
my
voice
14
Instead
they
stubbornly
followed
their
own
hearts
and
they
followed
the
Baal
images
as
their
fathers
had
taught
them
to
do
15
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
am
making
this
people
eat
wormwood
and
I
will
make
them
drink
poisoned
water
16
I
will
scatter
them
among
the
nations
that
they
and
their
fathers
have
not
known
and
I
will
send
a
sword
after
them
until
I
will
have
exterminated
them
17
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Behave
with
understanding
Summon
the
women
who
sing
dirges
And
send
for
the
skilled
women
to
come
18
So
that
they
may
hurry
and
raise
a
lamentation
for
us
So
that
our
eyes
may
stream
with
tearsAnd
our
eyelids
trickle
with
water
19
For
the
sound
of
lamentation
has
been
heard
from
Zion
How
we
have
been
devastated
How
great
our
shame
is
For
we
have
left
the
land
and
they
have
thrown
down
our
homes
20
You
women
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
May
your
ear
receive
the
word
of
his
mouth
Teach
your
daughters
this
lamentation
And
teach
one
another
this
dirge
21
For
death
has
come
up
through
our
windows
It
has
entered
our
fortified
towersTo
take
away
the
children
from
the
streetsAnd
the
young
men
from
the
public
squares
22
Say
This
is
what
Jehovah
declares
The
dead
bodies
of
people
will
fall
like
manure
on
the
surface
of
the
field
Like
a
row
of
newly
cut
grain
after
the
reaper
With
no
one
to
gather
them
up
23
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Let
not
the
wise
man
boast
about
his
wisdom
Let
not
the
mighty
man
boast
about
his
mightiness
And
let
not
the
rich
man
boast
about
his
riches
24
But
let
the
one
boasting
boast
about
this
That
he
has
insight
and
knowledge
of
me
That
I
am
Jehovah
the
One
showing
loyal
love
justice
and
righteousness
in
the
earth
For
in
these
things
I
take
delight

declares
Jehovah
25
Look
Days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
and
I
will
hold
an
accounting
with
everyone
circumcised
and
yet
uncircumcised
26
with
Egypt
and
Judah
and
Edom
and
the
Ammonites
and
Moab
and
with
all
of
those
with
hair
clipped
at
the
temples
who
are
dwelling
in
the
wilderness
for
all
the
nations
are
uncircumcised
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
are
uncircumcised
in
heart
1
Hear
the
word
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
against
you
O
house
of
Israel
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Do
not
learn
the
way
of
the
nations
And
do
not
be
terrified
by
the
signs
of
the
heavensBecause
the
nations
are
terrified
by
them

3
For
the
customs
of
the
peoples
are
a
delusion
It
is
just
a
tree
of
the
forest
that
is
cut
down
Worked
by
the
hands
of
the
craftsman
with
his
tool

4
They
adorn
it
with
silver
and
goldAnd
fasten
it
with
hammer
and
nails
so
that
it
will
not
fall
over

5
Like
a
scarecrow
in
a
cucumber
field
they
cannot
speak
They
have
to
be
carried
for
they
cannot
walk
Do
not
fear
them
for
they
can
do
no
harm
Nor
can
they
do
any
good

6
No
one
is
like
you
O
Jehovah
You
are
great
and
your
name
is
great
and
mighty

7
Who
should
not
fear
you
O
King
of
the
nations
for
it
is
fitting
Because
among
all
the
wise
ones
of
the
nations
and
among
all
their
kingdoms
There
is
no
one
at
all
like
you

8
They
are
all
unreasoning
and
stupid
Instruction
from
a
tree
is
an
utter
delusion

9
Silver
plates
are
imported
from
Tarshish
and
gold
from
Uphaz
The
work
of
a
craftsman
of
the
hands
of
a
metalworker
Their
clothing
is
blue
thread
and
purple
wool
They
are
all
made
by
skilled
workers
10
But
Jehovah
is
truly
God
He
is
the
living
God
and
the
eternal
King
Because
of
his
indignation
the
earth
will
quake
And
no
nations
will
endure
his
denunciation
11
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
them
The
gods
that
did
not
make
the
heavens
and
the
earthWill
perish
from
the
earth
and
from
under
these
heavens
12
He
is
the
Maker
of
the
earth
by
his
power
The
One
who
established
the
productive
land
by
his
wisdomAnd
who
stretched
out
the
heavens
by
his
understanding
13
When
he
makes
his
voice
heard
The
waters
in
the
heavens
are
in
turmoil
And
he
causes
clouds
to
ascend
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
He
makes
lightning
for
the
rain
And
he
brings
the
wind
out
of
his
storehouses
14
Every
man
acts
unreasonably
and
without
knowledge
Every
metalworker
will
be
put
to
shame
because
of
the
carved
image
For
his
metal
image
is
a
falsehood
And
there
is
no
spirit
in
them
15
They
are
a
delusion
a
work
of
mockery
When
their
day
of
reckoning
comes
they
will
perish
16
The
Share
of
Jacob
is
not
like
these
things
For
he
is
the
One
who
formed
everything
And
Israel
is
the
staff
of
his
inheritance
Jehovah
of
armies
is
his
name
17
Gather
up
your
bundle
from
the
ground
O
woman
dwelling
under
siege
18
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
hurling
the
inhabitants
out
of
the
land
at
this
time
And
I
will
cause
them
to
experience
distress
19
Woe
to
me
because
of
my
breakdown
My
wound
is
incurable
And
I
said
Surely
this
is
my
sickness
and
I
must
bear
it
20
My
tent
has
been
devastated
and
my
tent
cords
have
all
been
torn
apart
My
sons
have
left
me
and
are
no
more
There
is
no
one
left
to
stretch
out
my
tent
or
raise
up
my
tent
cloths
21
For
the
shepherds
have
behaved
senselessly
And
they
have
not
inquired
of
Jehovah
That
is
why
they
have
not
acted
with
insight
And
all
their
flocks
have
been
scattered
22
Listen
A
report
It
is
coming
A
great
pounding
from
the
land
of
the
north
To
make
the
cities
of
Judah
desolate
a
lair
of
jackals
23
I
well
know
O
Jehovah
that
mans
way
does
not
belong
to
him
It
does
not
belong
to
man
who
is
walking
even
to
direct
his
step
24
Correct
me
O
Jehovah
with
judgment
But
not
in
your
anger
that
you
may
not
reduce
me
to
nothing
25
Pour
out
your
wrath
on
the
nations
who
ignore
youAnd
on
the
families
who
do
not
call
on
your
name
For
they
have
devoured
Jacob
Yes
they
have
devoured
him
to
the
point
of
extermination
And
they
have
desolated
his
homeland
1
This
is
the
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
2
Hear
the
words
of
this
covenant
you
people
Speak
them
to
the
men
of
Judah
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
3
and
say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Cursed
is
the
man
who
does
not
obey
the
words
of
this
covenant
4
which
I
commanded
your
forefathers
on
the
day
I
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
out
of
the
iron-smelting
furnace
saying
Obey
my
voice
and
do
all
the
things
that
I
command
you
and
you
will
become
my
people
and
I
will
be
your
God
5
so
that
I
may
fulfill
the
oath
that
I
swore
to
your
forefathers
to
give
them
the
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
as
it
is
this
day
And
I
answered
Amen
O
Jehovah
6
Jehovah
then
said
to
me
Proclaim
all
these
words
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
Hear
the
words
of
this
covenant
and
carry
them
out
7
For
I
solemnly
admonished
your
forefathers
in
the
day
I
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
and
to
this
day
admonishing
them
again
and
again
Obey
my
voice
8
But
they
did
not
listen
or
incline
their
ear
instead
each
kept
stubbornly
following
his
own
wicked
heart
So
I
brought
on
them
all
the
words
of
this
covenant
that
I
commanded
them
to
do
but
they
refused
to
carry
them
out
9
Jehovah
then
said
to
me
There
is
a
conspiracy
among
the
men
of
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
10
They
have
returned
to
the
errors
of
their
forefathers
of
old
who
refused
to
obey
my
words
They
too
have
followed
other
gods
and
have
served
them
The
house
of
Israel
and
the
house
of
Judah
have
broken
my
covenant
that
I
made
with
their
forefathers
11
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
bringing
on
them
a
calamity
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
escape
When
they
call
to
me
for
help
I
will
not
listen
to
them
12
Then
the
cities
of
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
will
go
to
the
gods
to
which
they
are
making
sacrifices
and
call
for
help
but
these
will
by
no
means
save
them
in
the
time
of
their
calamity
13
For
your
gods
have
become
as
many
as
your
cities
O
Judah
and
you
have
set
up
as
many
altars
to
the
shameful
thing
as
there
are
streets
in
Jerusalem
altars
to
make
sacrifices
to
Baal
14
As
for
you
do
not
pray
in
behalf
of
this
people
Do
not
cry
out
in
their
behalf
or
offer
a
prayer
for
them
for
I
will
not
be
listening
when
they
call
out
to
me
because
of
their
calamity
15
What
right
does
my
beloved
one
have
to
be
in
my
houseWhen
so
many
have
carried
out
evil
schemes
With
holy
flesh
will
they
avert
the
calamity
when
it
comes
upon
you
Will
you
exult
at
that
time
16
Jehovah
once
called
you
a
thriving
olive
tree
Beautiful
with
fine
fruit
With
a
great
roaring
sound
he
has
set
her
on
fire
And
they
have
broken
its
branches
17
Jehovah
of
armies
your
Planter
has
declared
that
a
calamity
will
come
upon
you
because
of
the
evil
committed
by
the
house
of
Israel
and
the
house
of
Judah
who
have
offended
me
by
making
sacrifices
to
Baal
18
Jehovah
informed
me
so
that
I
would
know
At
that
time
you
caused
me
to
see
what
they
were
doing
19
I
was
like
a
docile
lamb
being
brought
to
the
slaughter
I
did
not
know
that
they
were
scheming
against
me
Let
us
destroy
the
tree
with
its
fruit
And
let
us
cut
him
off
from
the
land
of
the
living
So
that
his
name
may
be
remembered
no
more
20
But
Jehovah
of
armies
judges
with
righteousness
He
examines
the
innermost
thoughts
and
the
heart
Let
me
see
your
vengeance
on
them
For
to
you
I
have
committed
my
legal
case
21
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
against
the
men
of
Anathoth
who
are
seeking
to
take
your
life
and
who
say
You
must
not
prophesy
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
or
you
will
die
by
our
hand
22
therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Here
I
am
going
to
call
them
to
account
The
young
men
will
die
by
the
sword
and
their
sons
and
their
daughters
will
die
by
famine
23
Not
even
a
remnant
will
be
left
of
them
because
I
will
bring
calamity
on
the
men
of
Anathoth
in
the
year
of
their
being
called
to
account
1
You
are
righteous
O
Jehovah
when
I
make
my
complaint
to
you
When
I
speak
about
matters
of
justice
with
you
But
why
is
the
way
of
wicked
ones
successful
And
why
are
the
treacherous
unworried

2
You
planted
them
and
they
have
taken
root
They
have
grown
and
produced
fruit
You
are
on
their
lips
but
far
away
from
their
innermost
thoughts

3
But
you
know
me
well
O
Jehovah
you
see
me
You
have
examined
my
heart
and
found
it
in
union
with
you
Single
them
out
like
sheep
for
slaughtering
And
set
them
apart
for
the
day
of
killing

4
How
much
longer
should
the
land
wither
awayAnd
the
vegetation
of
every
field
dry
up
Because
of
the
evil
of
those
dwelling
in
it
The
beasts
and
the
birds
have
been
swept
away
For
they
have
said
He
does
not
see
what
will
happen
to
us

5
If
you
get
tired
running
with
footmen
How
can
you
run
a
race
against
horses
Even
if
you
are
confident
in
the
land
of
peace
How
will
you
fare
among
the
dense
thickets
along
the
Jordan

6
For
even
your
own
brothers
the
household
of
your
own
father
Have
dealt
treacherously
with
you
They
have
raised
a
loud
cry
against
you
Do
not
put
faith
in
them
Even
if
they
speak
good
things
to
you

7
I
have
abandoned
my
house
I
have
deserted
my
inheritance
I
have
given
my
dearly
beloved
one
into
the
hand
of
her
enemies

8
My
inheritance
has
become
to
me
like
a
lion
in
the
forest
She
has
roared
against
me
So
I
have
come
to
hate
her

9
My
inheritance
is
like
a
multicolored
bird
of
prey
to
me
The
other
birds
of
prey
surround
it
and
attack
it
Come
gather
together
all
you
beasts
of
the
field
Come
to
eat
10
Many
shepherds
have
destroyed
my
vineyard
They
have
trampled
my
portion
of
land
They
have
turned
my
desirable
portion
of
land
into
a
desolate
wilderness
11
It
has
become
a
wasteland
It
has
withered
It
is
desolate
before
me
The
whole
land
has
been
made
desolate
But
no
man
takes
it
to
heart
12
On
all
the
worn
paths
through
the
wilderness
the
destroyers
have
come
For
the
sword
of
Jehovah
is
devouring
from
one
end
of
the
land
to
the
other
end
There
is
no
peace
for
anyone
13
They
have
sown
wheat
but
they
have
reaped
thorns
They
have
worn
themselves
out
but
to
no
benefit
They
will
be
ashamed
of
their
produceBecause
of
the
burning
anger
of
Jehovah
14
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
against
all
my
wicked
neighbors
who
are
touching
the
inheritance
that
I
caused
my
people
Israel
to
possess
Here
I
am
uprooting
them
from
their
land
and
I
will
uproot
the
house
of
Judah
from
among
them
15
But
after
I
uproot
them
I
will
again
have
mercy
on
them
and
bring
each
of
them
back
to
his
inheritance
and
to
his
land
16
And
if
they
make
sure
to
learn
the
ways
of
my
people
and
to
swear
by
my
name
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
just
as
they
taught
my
people
to
swear
by
Baal
they
will
then
be
built
up
among
my
people
17
But
if
they
refuse
to
obey
I
will
also
uproot
that
nation
uprooting
and
destroying
it

declares
Jehovah
1
This
is
what
Jehovah
told
me
Go
and
buy
a
linen
belt
for
yourself
and
put
it
around
your
waist
but
do
not
dip
it
in
water
2
So
I
bought
the
belt
according
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
and
put
it
around
my
waist
3
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
a
second
time
4
Take
the
belt
that
you
bought
and
are
wearing
and
get
up
go
to
the
Euphrates
and
hide
it
there
in
a
cleft
of
the
crag
5
So
I
went
and
hid
it
by
the
Euphrates
just
as
Jehovah
had
commanded
me
6
But
many
days
later
Jehovah
said
to
me
Get
up
go
to
the
Euphrates
and
take
from
there
the
belt
that
I
commanded
you
to
hide
there
7
So
I
went
to
the
Euphrates
and
dug
up
the
belt
and
took
it
from
the
place
where
I
had
hidden
it
and
I
saw
that
the
belt
had
been
ruined
it
was
completely
useless
8
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
9
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
In
the
same
way
I
will
destroy
the
pride
of
Judah
and
the
immense
pride
of
Jerusalem
10
These
evil
people
who
refuse
to
obey
my
words
who
stubbornly
follow
their
own
heart
and
who
are
following
other
gods
serving
and
bowing
down
to
them
will
become
just
like
this
belt
that
is
completely
useless
11
For
just
as
a
belt
clings
to
the
waist
of
a
man
so
I
made
the
whole
house
of
Israel
and
the
whole
house
of
Judah
cling
to
me

declares
Jehovah
to
become
to
me
a
people
a
name
a
praise
and
something
beautiful
But
they
did
not
obey
12
And
you
must
also
give
this
message
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Every
large
jar
should
be
filled
with
wine
And
they
will
reply
to
you
Do
we
not
already
know
that
every
large
jar
should
be
filled
with
wine
13
Then
say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
filling
with
drunkenness
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
land
the
kings
sitting
on
the
throne
of
David
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
14
And
I
will
smash
them
against
each
other
fathers
and
sons
alike

declares
Jehovah
I
will
not
show
compassion
or
feel
any
sorrow
or
have
any
mercy
on
them
nothing
will
stop
me
from
bringing
them
to
ruin
15
Hear
and
pay
attention
Do
not
be
haughty
for
Jehovah
has
spoken
16
Give
glory
to
Jehovah
your
GodBefore
he
brings
darknessAnd
before
your
feet
stumble
on
the
mountains
at
dusk
You
will
hope
for
the
light
But
he
will
bring
deep
shadow
He
will
turn
it
into
thick
gloom
17
And
if
you
refuse
to
listen
I
will
weep
in
secret
because
of
your
pride
I
will
shed
many
tears
and
my
eyes
will
stream
with
tears
Because
the
flock
of
Jehovah
has
been
carried
away
captive
18
Tell
the
king
and
the
queen
mother
Sit
in
a
lower
place
For
your
beautiful
crown
will
fall
from
your
head
19
The
cities
of
the
south
are
shut
with
no
one
to
open
them
All
of
Judah
has
been
taken
into
exile
taken
completely
into
exile
20
Raise
your
eyes
and
see
those
coming
from
the
north
Where
is
the
flock
you
were
given
your
beautiful
sheep
21
What
will
you
say
when
your
punishment
comesFrom
your
close
friends
whom
you
cultivated
from
the
start
Will
not
birth
pains
seize
you
like
those
of
a
woman
giving
birth
22
And
when
you
say
in
your
heart
Why
have
these
things
befallen
me
It
is
because
of
your
great
error
that
your
skirts
have
been
stripped
off
And
your
heels
have
been
treated
violently
23
Can
a
Cushite
change
his
skin
or
a
leopard
its
spots
If
so
then
you
can
do
good
You
who
are
trained
to
do
bad
24
So
I
will
scatter
them
like
straw
blown
by
the
desert
wind
25
This
is
your
lot
the
portion
that
I
have
measured
out
to
you

declares
Jehovah
Because
you
have
forgotten
me
and
you
trust
in
lies
26
Therefore
I
will
lift
up
your
skirts
over
your
face
And
your
shame
will
be
seen
27
Your
acts
of
adultery
and
your
lustful
neighing
Your
obscene
prostitution
On
the
hills
in
the
field
I
have
seen
your
disgusting
behavior
Woe
to
you
O
Jerusalem
How
much
longer
will
you
remain
unclean
1
This
is
the
word
of
Jehovah
that
came
to
Jeremiah
concerning
the
droughts

2
Judah
mourns
and
its
gates
have
faded
away
They
sink
to
the
ground
dejected
And
a
cry
goes
up
from
Jerusalem

3
And
their
masters
send
their
servants
for
water
They
go
to
the
water
holes
and
find
no
water
They
return
with
their
vessels
empty
They
are
ashamed
and
disappointed
And
they
cover
their
heads

4
Because
the
ground
is
cracked
For
there
is
no
rain
on
the
land
The
farmers
are
dismayed
and
cover
their
heads

5
Even
the
doe
in
the
field
forsakes
her
newbornBecause
there
is
no
grass

6
The
wild
donkeys
stand
on
the
bare
hills
They
pant
for
air
like
jackals
Their
eyes
fail
because
there
is
no
vegetation

7
Although
our
own
errors
testify
against
us
O
Jehovah
act
for
the
sake
of
your
name
For
our
acts
of
unfaithfulness
are
many
And
it
is
against
you
that
we
have
sinned

8
O
hope
of
Israel
his
Savior
in
times
of
distress
Why
are
you
like
a
stranger
in
the
land
Like
a
traveler
who
stops
only
to
spend
the
night

9
Why
are
you
like
a
man
who
is
stunned
Like
a
mighty
man
who
cannot
save
For
you
are
among
us
O
Jehovah
And
your
name
has
been
called
on
us
Do
not
abandon
us
10
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
concerning
this
people
They
love
to
wander
about
they
have
not
restrained
their
feet
So
Jehovah
finds
no
pleasure
in
them
Now
he
will
remember
their
error
and
call
them
to
account
for
their
sins
11
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
Do
not
pray
for
good
to
come
to
this
people
12
When
they
fast
I
do
not
listen
to
their
entreaties
and
when
they
offer
whole
burnt
offerings
and
grain
offerings
I
take
no
pleasure
in
them
for
by
the
sword
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
I
will
do
away
with
them
13
At
this
I
said
Alas
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Here
the
prophets
are
saying
to
them
You
will
not
see
the
sword
and
famine
will
not
come
upon
you
but
I
will
give
you
true
peace
in
this
place
14
Jehovah
then
said
to
me
The
prophets
are
prophesying
lies
in
my
name
I
have
not
sent
them
or
commanded
them
or
spoken
to
them
A
lying
vision
and
a
worthless
divination
and
the
deceit
of
their
own
heart
is
what
they
are
prophesying
to
you
15
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
concerning
the
prophets
who
are
prophesying
in
my
name
though
I
did
not
send
them
and
who
say
that
no
sword
or
famine
will
occur
in
this
land
By
sword
and
by
famine
those
prophets
will
perish
16
And
the
people
to
whom
they
are
prophesying
will
be
cast
out
into
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
because
of
the
famine
and
the
sword
with
no
one
to
bury
them—them
their
wives
their
sons
or
their
daughters—for
I
will
pour
out
on
them
the
calamity
they
deserve
17
You
must
speak
this
word
to
them
Let
my
eyes
stream
with
tears
night
and
day
let
them
not
cease
For
the
virgin
daughter
of
my
people
has
been
completely
crushed
and
broken
With
an
extremely
severe
wound
18
If
I
go
out
into
the
field
and
look
I
see
those
slain
by
the
sword
And
if
I
come
into
the
city
I
see
the
diseases
from
the
famine
For
both
the
prophet
and
the
priest
have
gone
around
in
a
land
that
they
do
not
know
19
Have
you
completely
rejected
Judah
or
have
you
abhorred
Zion
Why
have
you
struck
us
so
that
there
is
no
healing
for
us
There
was
a
hope
for
peace
but
nothing
good
came
For
a
time
of
healing
but
there
is
terror
20
We
acknowledge
our
wickedness
O
Jehovah
And
the
error
of
our
forefathers
For
we
have
sinned
against
you
21
For
the
sake
of
your
name
do
not
reject
us
Do
not
despise
your
glorious
throne
Remember
and
do
not
break
your
covenant
with
us
22
Can
any
of
the
worthless
idols
of
the
nations
give
rain
Or
can
even
the
heavens
send
showers
of
rain
on
their
own
Are
you
not
the
only
One
O
Jehovah
our
God
And
we
hope
in
you
For
you
alone
have
done
all
these
things
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
Even
if
Moses
and
Samuel
were
standing
before
me
I
would
show
no
favor
toward
this
people
Drive
them
out
from
before
me
Let
them
go
2
And
if
they
say
to
you
Where
should
we
go
you
must
say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Whoever
is
for
deadly
plague
to
deadly
plague
Whoever
is
for
the
sword
to
the
sword
Whoever
is
for
the
famine
to
the
famine
And
whoever
is
for
the
captivity
to
the
captivity
3
And
I
will
appoint
over
them
four
calamities

declares
Jehovah
the
sword
to
kill
the
dogs
to
drag
away
and
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
the
beasts
of
the
earth
to
devour
and
to
destroy
4
And
I
will
make
them
an
object
of
horror
to
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
because
of
Manasseh
the
son
of
Hezekiah
the
king
of
Judah
for
what
he
did
in
Jerusalem

5
Who
will
show
compassion
to
you
O
Jerusalem
Who
will
sympathize
with
you
And
who
will
stop
to
ask
about
your
welfare

6
You
have
deserted
me

declares
Jehovah
You
keep
turning
your
back
on
me
So
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand
against
you
and
destroy
you
I
am
tired
of
feeling
pity
for
you

7
And
I
will
winnow
them
with
a
fork
in
the
gates
of
the
land
I
will
bereave
them
of
children
I
will
destroy
my
people
Since
they
refuse
to
turn
back
from
their
ways

8
Their
widows
will
become
more
numerous
before
me
than
the
sand
of
the
seas
I
will
bring
a
destroyer
against
them
at
midday
against
mothers
and
young
men
I
will
bring
agitation
and
terror
upon
them
suddenly

9
The
woman
who
bore
seven
children
has
grown
faint
She
struggles
for
breath
Her
sun
has
set
while
it
is
yet
day
Causing
shame
and
humiliation
And
those
few
remaining
ones
of
themI
will
give
to
the
sword
before
their
enemies

declares
Jehovah
10
Woe
to
me
O
my
mother
because
you
gave
birth
to
me
A
man
subject
to
quarrel
and
strife
with
all
the
land
I
have
neither
loaned
nor
borrowed
But
all
of
them
curse
me
11
Jehovah
said
I
will
surely
minister
to
you
for
good
I
will
surely
intercede
for
you
in
the
time
of
calamity
In
the
time
of
distress
against
the
enemy
12
Can
anyone
break
iron
in
pieces
Iron
from
the
north
and
copper
13
Your
resources
and
your
treasures
I
will
give
as
plunder
Not
for
a
price
but
because
of
all
your
sins
throughout
all
your
territories
14
I
will
give
them
to
your
enemiesTo
take
to
a
land
you
do
not
know
For
a
fire
has
been
ignited
by
my
anger
And
it
is
burning
against
you
15
You
know
O
Jehovah
Remember
me
and
turn
your
attention
to
me
Take
vengeance
on
my
persecutors
for
me
Do
not
let
me
perish
because
of
your
slowness
to
anger
Know
that
for
your
sake
I
bear
this
reproach
16
Your
words
were
found
and
I
ate
them
And
your
word
became
to
me
the
exultation
and
the
rejoicing
of
my
heart
For
your
name
has
been
called
on
me
O
Jehovah
God
of
armies
17
I
do
not
sit
in
the
company
of
merrymakers
and
rejoice
Because
your
hand
is
upon
me
I
sit
alone
For
you
have
filled
me
with
indignation
18
Why
is
my
pain
chronic
and
my
wound
incurable
It
refuses
to
be
healed
Will
you
become
to
me
like
a
deceptive
water
supplyThat
cannot
be
relied
on
19
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
If
you
return
then
I
will
restore
you
And
you
will
stand
before
me
If
you
separate
what
is
precious
from
what
is
worthless
You
will
become
like
my
own
mouth
They
will
have
to
turn
to
you
But
you
will
not
turn
to
them
20
I
am
making
you
a
fortified
copper
wall
to
this
people
They
will
certainly
fight
against
you
But
they
will
not
prevail
against
you
For
I
am
with
you
to
save
you
and
to
rescue
you

declares
Jehovah
21
And
I
will
rescue
you
from
the
hand
of
the
wickedAnd
redeem
you
from
the
palm
of
the
ruthless
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
You
must
not
take
a
wife
for
yourself
and
you
must
not
have
sons
and
daughters
in
this
place
3
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
concerning
the
sons
and
daughters
who
are
born
here
and
concerning
their
mothers
who
give
birth
to
them
and
concerning
their
fathers
who
cause
their
birth
in
this
land
4
They
will
die
of
deadly
diseases
but
no
one
will
mourn
them
or
bury
them
they
will
become
like
manure
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
They
will
perish
by
the
sword
and
by
famine
and
their
dead
bodies
will
be
food
for
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth

5
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Do
not
enter
a
house
where
a
mourners
feast
is
held
And
do
not
go
to
wail
or
offer
sympathy
For
I
have
taken
away
my
peace
from
this
people

declares
Jehovah
As
well
as
my
loyal
love
and
mercy

6
Both
the
great
and
the
small
will
die
in
this
land
They
will
not
be
buried
No
one
will
mourn
them
Nor
will
anyone
cut
himself
or
make
himself
bald
for
them

7
And
no
one
will
provide
food
for
those
in
mourning
To
comfort
them
over
their
dead
Nor
will
anyone
give
them
the
cup
of
consolationTo
drink
over
the
loss
of
their
father
or
mother

8
And
do
not
enter
a
house
of
feastingTo
sit
down
with
them
to
eat
and
drink
9
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
in
this
place
in
your
days
and
before
your
very
eyes
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
sounds
of
exultation
and
rejoicing
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
10
When
you
tell
this
people
all
these
words
they
will
ask
you
Why
has
Jehovah
spoken
of
all
this
great
calamity
against
us
What
error
and
what
sin
have
we
committed
against
Jehovah
our
God
11
You
must
reply
to
them
Because
your
forefathers
abandoned
me

declares
Jehovah
and
they
kept
following
other
gods
and
serving
them
and
bowing
down
to
them
But
me
they
abandoned
and
my
law
they
did
not
keep
12
And
you
have
behaved
far
worse
than
your
forefathers
and
each
one
of
you
follows
the
stubbornness
of
his
wicked
heart
instead
of
obeying
me
13
So
I
will
hurl
you
out
of
this
land
into
a
land
that
neither
you
nor
your
forefathers
have
known
and
there
you
will
have
to
serve
other
gods
day
and
night
because
I
will
show
you
no
favor
14
However
the
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
they
will
no
longer
say
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
who
brought
the
people
of
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
15
but
rather
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
who
brought
the
people
of
Israel
from
the
land
of
the
north
and
from
all
the
lands
to
which
he
had
dispersed
them
and
I
will
bring
them
back
to
their
land
which
I
gave
to
their
forefathers
16
Here
I
am
sending
for
many
fishermen

declares
Jehovah
And
they
will
fish
for
them
After
that
I
will
send
for
many
hunters
And
they
will
hunt
them
down
on
every
mountain
and
every
hillAnd
out
of
the
clefts
of
the
crags
17
For
my
eyes
are
on
everything
they
do
They
have
not
been
hidden
from
before
me
Nor
has
their
error
been
hidden
from
my
eyes
18
First
I
will
repay
the
full
amount
due
for
their
error
and
their
sin
For
they
have
profaned
my
land
with
the
lifeless
figures
of
their
disgusting
idolsAnd
have
filled
my
inheritance
with
their
detestable
things
19
O
Jehovah
my
strength
and
my
stronghold
My
place
to
flee
in
the
day
of
distress
To
you
the
nations
will
come
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
And
they
will
say
Our
forefathers
inherited
utter
falsehood
Futility
and
useless
things
of
no
benefit
20
Can
a
man
make
gods
for
himselfWhen
they
are
not
really
gods
21
So
I
will
make
them
know
At
this
time
I
will
make
them
know
my
power
and
my
might
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
my
name
is
Jehovah
1
The
sin
of
Judah
is
written
down
with
an
iron
stylus
With
a
diamond
point
it
is
engraved
on
the
tablet
of
their
heartAnd
on
the
horns
of
their
altars
2
While
their
sons
remember
their
altars
and
their
sacred
polesBeside
a
luxuriant
tree
on
the
high
hills
3
On
the
mountains
in
the
open
countryside
Your
resources
all
your
treasures
I
will
give
as
plunder—Yes
your
high
places
because
of
sin
throughout
your
territories

4
You
will
forfeit
of
your
own
accord
your
inheritance
that
I
gave
you
And
I
will
make
you
serve
your
enemies
in
a
land
you
do
not
know
For
you
have
kindled
my
anger
like
a
fire
It
will
burn
for
all
time

5
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Cursed
is
the
man
who
puts
his
trust
in
mere
humans
Who
relies
on
human
power
And
whose
heart
turns
away
from
Jehovah

6
He
will
become
like
a
solitary
tree
in
the
desert
He
will
not
see
when
good
comes
But
he
will
reside
in
parched
places
in
the
wilderness
In
a
salt
land
where
no
one
can
live

7
Blessed
is
the
man
who
puts
his
trust
in
Jehovah
Whose
confidence
is
in
Jehovah

8
He
will
become
like
a
tree
planted
by
the
waters
That
sends
out
its
roots
to
the
stream
He
will
not
notice
when
heat
comes
But
his
leaves
will
always
flourish
And
in
the
year
of
drought
he
will
not
be
anxious
Nor
will
he
quit
producing
fruit

9
The
heart
is
more
treacherous
than
anything
else
and
is
desperate
Who
can
know
it
10
I
Jehovah
am
searching
the
heart
Examining
the
innermost
thoughts
To
give
to
each
one
according
to
his
ways
According
to
the
fruitage
of
his
works
11
Like
a
partridge
that
gathers
what
it
has
not
laid
So
is
the
one
who
acquires
riches
dishonestly
They
will
leave
him
in
midlife
And
in
the
end
he
will
prove
senseless
12
A
glorious
throne
exalted
from
the
beginning
Is
the
place
of
our
sanctuary
13
O
Jehovah
the
hope
of
Israel
All
those
who
abandon
you
will
be
put
to
shame
Those
apostatizing
from
you
will
be
written
in
the
dust
Because
they
have
abandoned
Jehovah
the
source
of
living
water
14
Heal
me
O
Jehovah
and
I
will
be
healed
Save
me
and
I
will
be
saved
For
you
are
the
object
of
my
praise
15
Look
There
are
those
saying
to
me
Where
is
the
word
of
Jehovah
Let
it
come
please
16
But
as
for
me
I
did
not
run
away
from
following
you
as
a
shepherd
Nor
did
I
long
for
the
day
of
disaster
You
well
know
everything
my
lips
have
spoken
It
all
took
place
before
your
face
17
Do
not
be
a
cause
of
terror
to
me
You
are
my
refuge
in
the
day
of
calamity
18
Let
my
persecutors
be
put
to
shame
But
do
not
let
me
be
put
to
shame
Let
them
be
struck
with
terror
But
do
not
let
me
be
struck
with
terror
Bring
the
day
of
calamity
on
them
And
crush
them
and
destroy
them
completely
19
This
is
what
Jehovah
told
me
Go
and
stand
in
the
gate
of
the
sons
of
the
people
by
which
the
kings
of
Judah
go
in
and
out
and
in
all
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
20
You
must
say
to
them
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
you
kings
of
Judah
all
people
of
Judah
and
all
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
who
enter
by
these
gates
21
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Watch
yourselves
and
do
not
carry
any
load
on
the
Sabbath
day
or
bring
it
in
through
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
22
You
must
not
bring
any
load
out
of
your
homes
on
the
Sabbath
day
and
you
must
do
no
work
at
all
Keep
the
Sabbath
day
sacred
just
as
I
commanded
your
forefathers
23
But
they
did
not
listen
or
incline
their
ear
and
they
stubbornly
refused
to
obey
or
to
accept
discipline
24
However
if
you
strictly
obey
me

declares
Jehovah
and
you
bring
in
no
load
through
the
gates
of
this
city
on
the
Sabbath
day
and
you
keep
the
Sabbath
day
sacred
by
not
doing
any
work
on
it
25
then
kings
and
princes
who
sit
on
the
throne
of
David
will
also
enter
in
through
the
gates
of
this
city
riding
in
the
chariot
and
on
horses
they
and
their
princes
the
men
of
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
and
this
city
will
be
inhabited
for
all
time
26
And
people
will
come
from
the
cities
of
Judah
from
the
places
around
Jerusalem
from
the
land
of
Benjamin
from
the
lowland
from
the
mountainous
region
and
from
the
Negeb
bringing
whole
burnt
offerings
sacrifices
grain
offerings
frankincense
and
thanksgiving
sacrifices
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
27
But
if
you
do
not
obey
me
by
keeping
the
Sabbath
day
sacred
and
by
not
carrying
loads
and
bringing
them
through
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
on
the
Sabbath
day
I
will
set
her
gates
on
fire
and
it
will
certainly
consume
the
fortified
towers
of
Jerusalem
and
will
not
be
extinguished
1
This
is
the
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
2
Rise
up
and
go
down
to
the
house
of
the
potter
and
there
I
will
cause
you
to
hear
my
words
3
So
I
went
down
to
the
house
of
the
potter
and
he
was
working
on
the
potters
wheels
4
But
the
vessel
that
the
potter
was
making
with
the
clay
was
spoiled
in
his
hand
So
the
potter
reworked
it
into
another
vessel
just
as
he
saw
fit
5
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
6
Can
I
not
do
to
you
just
as
this
potter
did
O
house
of
Israel
declares
Jehovah
Look
As
the
clay
in
the
hand
of
the
potter
so
are
you
in
my
hand
O
house
of
Israel
7
Whenever
I
may
speak
about
uprooting
and
pulling
down
and
destroying
a
nation
or
a
kingdom
8
and
that
nation
abandons
its
wickedness
that
I
spoke
against
I
will
also
change
my
mind
concerning
the
calamity
that
I
intended
to
bring
against
it
9
But
whenever
I
speak
about
building
up
and
planting
a
nation
or
a
kingdom
10
and
it
does
what
is
bad
in
my
eyes
and
does
not
obey
my
voice
I
will
change
my
mind
concerning
the
good
that
I
intended
to
do
for
it
11
Now
say
please
to
the
men
of
Judah
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
preparing
a
calamity
and
devising
a
scheme
against
you
Turn
back
please
from
your
bad
ways
and
reform
your
ways
and
your
practices
12
But
they
said
It
is
hopeless
For
we
will
walk
after
our
own
thoughts
and
each
of
us
will
act
according
to
the
stubbornness
of
his
wicked
heart
13
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Ask
for
yourselves
please
among
the
nations
Who
has
heard
anything
like
this
The
virgin
of
Israel
has
done
a
most
horrible
thing
14
Does
the
snow
of
Lebanon
disappear
from
the
rocks
on
its
slopes
Or
will
cool
waters
flowing
from
afar
dry
up
15
But
my
people
have
forgotten
me
For
they
make
sacrifices
to
something
worthless
And
they
make
men
stumble
in
their
ways
the
ancient
paths
To
walk
on
back
roads
that
are
not
smooth
and
level
16
In
order
to
make
their
land
an
object
of
horrorAnd
something
to
whistle
at
forever
Every
last
one
passing
by
it
will
stare
in
horror
and
shake
his
head
17
Like
the
east
wind
I
will
scatter
them
before
the
enemy
I
will
show
them
my
back
not
my
face
in
the
day
of
their
disaster
18
And
they
said
Come
let
us
devise
a
plot
against
Jeremiah
for
the
law
will
not
perish
from
our
priests
or
counsel
from
the
wise
men
or
the
word
from
the
prophets
Come
and
let
us
speak
against
him
and
pay
no
attention
to
what
he
says
19
Do
pay
attention
to
me
O
Jehovah
And
listen
to
what
my
opponents
are
saying
20
Should
good
be
repaid
with
bad
For
they
have
dug
a
pit
for
my
life
Remember
how
I
stood
before
you
to
speak
good
about
them
To
turn
your
wrath
away
from
them
21
So
give
their
sons
over
to
the
famine
And
hand
them
over
to
the
power
of
the
sword
May
their
wives
become
bereaved
of
children
and
widowed
May
their
men
be
killed
with
deadly
plague
Their
young
men
struck
down
with
the
sword
in
battle
22
Let
a
cry
be
heard
from
their
housesWhen
you
bring
marauders
on
them
suddenly
For
they
have
dug
a
pit
to
capture
meAnd
have
laid
traps
for
my
feet
23
But
you
O
Jehovah
Well
know
all
their
schemes
against
me
to
kill
me
Do
not
cover
their
error
And
do
not
wipe
out
their
sin
from
before
you
Let
them
stumble
before
youWhen
you
take
action
against
them
in
your
anger
1
This
is
what
Jehovah
said
Go
and
buy
an
earthenware
flask
from
a
potter
Take
some
of
the
elders
of
the
people
and
some
of
the
elders
of
the
priests
2
and
go
out
to
the
Valley
of
the
Son
of
Hinnom
at
the
entrance
of
the
Gate
of
the
Potsherds
And
there
proclaim
the
words
that
I
speak
to
you
3
You
will
say
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
you
kings
of
Judah
and
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
I
am
about
to
bring
a
calamity
on
this
place
and
the
ears
of
anyone
who
hears
about
it
will
tingle
4
It
is
because
they
abandoned
me
and
made
this
place
unrecognizable
In
it
they
are
sacrificing
to
other
gods
whom
they
and
their
forefathers
and
the
kings
of
Judah
had
not
known
and
they
have
filled
this
place
with
the
blood
of
the
innocent
ones
5
They
built
the
high
places
of
Baal
in
order
to
burn
their
sons
in
the
fire
as
whole
burnt
offerings
to
Baal
something
that
I
had
not
commanded
or
spoken
of
and
that
had
never
even
come
into
my
heart
6
Therefore
look
the
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
this
place
will
no
longer
be
called
Topheth
or
the
Valley
of
the
Son
of
Hinnom
but
the
Valley
of
the
Slaughter
7
I
will
thwart
the
plans
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
in
this
place
and
I
will
make
them
fall
by
the
sword
before
their
enemies
and
by
the
hand
of
those
seeking
to
take
their
life
And
I
will
give
their
dead
bodies
as
food
to
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
to
the
beasts
of
the
earth
8
And
I
will
make
this
city
an
object
of
horror
and
something
to
whistle
at
Every
last
one
passing
by
it
will
stare
in
horror
and
whistle
over
all
its
plagues
9
And
I
will
make
them
eat
the
flesh
of
their
sons
and
daughters
and
they
will
each
eat
the
flesh
of
his
fellow
man
because
of
the
siege
and
their
desperation
when
they
are
hemmed
in
by
their
enemies
and
those
seeking
to
take
their
life
10
Then
break
the
flask
before
the
eyes
of
the
men
who
go
with
you
11
and
say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
This
is
how
I
will
break
this
people
and
this
city
like
someone
who
breaks
a
potters
vessel
so
that
it
can
never
be
repaired
and
they
will
bury
the
dead
in
Topheth
until
there
is
no
more
room
to
bury
them
12
That
is
what
I
will
do
to
this
place

declares
Jehovah
and
to
its
inhabitants
to
make
this
city
like
Topheth
13
And
the
houses
of
Jerusalem
and
the
houses
of
the
kings
of
Judah
will
become
unclean
like
this
place
Topheth
yes
all
the
houses
on
whose
roofs
they
offered
sacrifices
to
all
the
army
of
the
heavens
and
where
they
poured
out
drink
offerings
to
other
gods
14
When
Jeremiah
returned
from
Topheth
where
Jehovah
sent
him
to
prophesy
he
stood
in
the
courtyard
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
said
to
all
the
people
15
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
am
bringing
on
this
city
and
on
all
its
towns
all
the
calamity
that
I
have
spoken
against
it
because
they
stubbornly
refused
to
obey
my
words
1
Now
Pashhur
the
son
of
Immer
the
priest
who
was
also
the
leading
commissioner
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
was
listening
when
Jeremiah
prophesied
these
things
2
Then
Pashhur
struck
Jeremiah
the
prophet
and
put
him
in
the
stocks
that
were
at
the
Upper
Gate
of
Benjamin
which
was
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
3
But
on
the
following
day
when
Pashhur
released
Jeremiah
from
the
stocks
Jeremiah
said
to
him
Jehovah
has
named
you
not
Pashhur
but
Terror
All
Around
4
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
will
make
you
an
object
of
terror
to
yourself
and
to
all
your
friends
and
they
will
fall
by
the
sword
of
their
enemies
while
your
eyes
are
looking
on
and
I
will
give
all
Judah
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
he
will
take
them
into
exile
in
Babylon
and
put
them
to
death
by
the
sword
5
And
I
will
give
all
the
wealth
of
this
city
all
its
resources
all
its
precious
things
and
all
the
treasures
of
the
kings
of
Judah
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
And
they
will
plunder
them
and
seize
them
and
take
them
to
Babylon
6
And
as
for
you
Pashhur
and
all
who
live
in
your
house
you
will
go
into
captivity
You
will
go
off
to
Babylon
and
die
there
and
you
will
be
buried
there
with
all
your
friends
because
you
have
prophesied
lies
to
them

7
You
have
fooled
me
O
Jehovah
and
I
was
fooled
You
used
your
strength
against
me
and
you
prevailed
I
have
become
a
laughingstock
all
day
long
Everyone
ridicules
me

8
For
whenever
I
speak
I
must
cry
out
and
proclaim
Violence
and
destruction
For
me
the
word
of
Jehovah
has
been
the
cause
of
insults
and
jeering
all
day
long

9
So
I
said
I
am
not
going
to
make
mention
of
him
And
I
will
speak
no
more
in
his
name
But
in
my
heart
it
became
like
a
burning
fire
shut
up
in
my
bones
And
I
was
tired
of
holding
it
in
I
could
no
longer
endure
it
10
For
I
heard
many
evil
rumors
Terror
surrounded
me
Denounce
him
let
us
denounce
him
Every
man
wishing
me
peace
was
watching
for
my
downfall
Perhaps
he
will
make
a
foolish
mistake
And
we
can
prevail
and
take
our
revenge
against
him
11
But
Jehovah
was
with
me
like
a
fearsome
warrior
That
is
why
those
persecuting
me
will
stumble
and
will
not
prevail
They
will
be
put
to
great
shame
for
they
will
not
succeed
Their
everlasting
humiliation
will
not
be
forgotten
12
But
you
O
Jehovah
of
armies
are
examining
the
righteous
one
You
see
the
innermost
thoughts
and
the
heart
Let
me
see
your
vengeance
on
them
For
to
you
I
have
committed
my
legal
case
13
Sing
to
Jehovah
Praise
Jehovah
For
he
has
rescued
the
poor
one
from
the
hand
of
evildoers
14
Cursed
be
the
day
I
was
born
May
the
day
my
mother
gave
birth
to
me
not
be
blessed
15
Cursed
be
the
man
who
brought
good
news
to
my
father
saying
A
son
has
been
born
to
you
a
boy
Making
him
rejoice
greatly
16
May
that
man
become
like
cities
that
Jehovah
overthrew
without
regret
May
he
hear
an
outcry
in
the
morning
and
the
sound
of
alarm
at
midday
17
Why
did
he
not
put
me
to
death
in
the
womb
So
that
my
mother
would
become
my
burial
placeAnd
her
womb
would
always
remain
pregnant
18
Why
did
I
have
to
come
out
of
the
wombTo
see
trouble
and
grief
To
end
my
days
in
shame
1
Jeremiah
received
the
word
from
Jehovah
when
King
Zedekiah
sent
to
him
Pashhur
son
of
Malchijah
and
Zephaniah
son
of
Maaseiah
the
priest
requesting
2
Please
inquire
of
Jehovah
in
our
behalf
because
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
is
waging
war
against
us
Perhaps
Jehovah
will
perform
one
of
his
wonderful
works
in
our
behalf
so
that
he
will
withdraw
from
us
3
Jeremiah
said
to
them
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
Zedekiah
4
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
am
turning
around
against
you
the
weapons
of
war
that
are
in
your
own
hands
with
which
you
are
fighting
the
king
of
Babylon
and
the
Chaldeans
who
are
outside
the
wall
besieging
you
And
I
will
gather
them
into
the
middle
of
this
city
5
And
I
myself
will
fight
against
you
with
an
outstretched
hand
and
a
mighty
arm
with
anger
and
wrath
and
great
indignation
6
I
will
strike
the
inhabitants
of
this
city
both
man
and
beast
By
a
great
pestilence
they
will
die
7
And
after
that

declares
Jehovah
I
will
give
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
and
his
servants
and
the
people
of
this
city—those
who
survive
the
pestilence
the
sword
and
the
famine—into
the
hand
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
those
who
are
seeking
to
take
their
life
He
will
strike
them
down
with
the
sword
He
will
not
feel
sorry
for
them
nor
will
he
show
compassion
or
have
any
mercy
8
And
to
this
people
you
should
say
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
putting
before
you
the
way
of
life
and
the
way
of
death
9
Those
who
remain
in
this
city
will
die
by
the
sword
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
But
whoever
goes
out
and
surrenders
to
the
Chaldeans
who
are
besieging
you
will
keep
living
and
he
will
have
his
life
as
a
spoil
10
For
I
have
set
my
face
against
this
city
for
calamity
and
not
for
good

declares
Jehovah
It
will
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
he
will
burn
it
with
fire
11
To
the
household
of
the
king
of
Judah
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
12
O
house
of
David
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Uphold
justice
every
morning
And
rescue
the
one
being
robbed
from
the
hand
of
the
defrauder
So
that
my
wrath
does
not
blaze
like
a
fireAnd
burn
with
no
one
to
extinguish
itBecause
of
your
evil
deeds
13
Here
I
am
against
you
O
inhabitant
of
the
valley
O
rock
of
the
level
land

declares
Jehovah
As
for
you
who
say
Who
will
come
down
against
us
And
who
will
invade
our
dwellings
14
I
will
hold
an
accounting
against
youAs
your
deeds
deserve

declares
Jehovah
And
I
will
set
her
forest
ablaze
And
it
will
consume
all
the
things
around
her
1
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Go
down
to
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah
and
deliver
this
message
2
You
must
say
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
O
king
of
Judah
who
sits
on
the
throne
of
David
you
with
your
servants
and
your
people
those
who
enter
through
these
gates
3
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Uphold
justice
and
righteousness
Rescue
the
one
being
robbed
from
the
hand
of
the
defrauder
Do
not
mistreat
any
foreign
resident
and
do
not
harm
any
fatherless
child
or
widow
And
do
not
shed
any
innocent
blood
in
this
place
4
For
if
you
are
careful
to
carry
out
this
word
then
the
kings
who
sit
on
the
throne
of
David
will
enter
through
the
gates
of
this
house
riding
in
chariots
and
on
horses
they
with
their
servants
and
their
people
5
But
if
you
will
not
obey
these
words
by
myself
I
do
swear

declares
Jehovah
that
this
house
will
become
a
devastated
place
6
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
concerning
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah
You
are
as
Gilead
to
me
Like
the
summit
of
Lebanon
But
I
will
make
you
a
wilderness
Not
one
of
your
cities
will
be
inhabited

7
And
I
will
appoint
destroyers
against
you
Each
with
his
weapons
They
will
cut
down
your
choicest
cedarsAnd
make
them
fall
into
the
fire
8
And
many
nations
will
pass
by
this
city
and
say
to
one
another
Why
did
Jehovah
do
this
to
this
great
city
9
And
they
will
reply
Because
they
abandoned
the
covenant
of
Jehovah
their
God
and
bowed
down
to
other
gods
and
served
them
10
Do
not
weep
for
the
dead
one
And
do
not
sympathize
with
him
Instead
weep
profusely
for
the
one
going
away
For
he
will
return
no
more
to
see
the
land
of
his
birth
11
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
concerning
Shallum
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
who
is
reigning
instead
of
his
father
Josiah
and
who
has
gone
out
of
this
place
He
will
return
there
no
more
12
For
he
will
die
in
the
place
where
they
have
taken
him
into
exile
and
he
will
see
this
land
no
more
13
Woe
to
the
one
who
builds
his
house
without
righteousnessAnd
his
upper
rooms
without
justice
Who
makes
his
fellow
man
serve
him
for
nothing
Whose
wages
he
refuses
to
pay
14
The
one
saying
I
will
build
for
myself
a
roomy
houseWith
spacious
upper
rooms
I
will
fit
it
with
windowsAnd
panel
it
with
cedar
and
paint
it
with
vermilion
15
Will
you
continue
reigning
because
you
outdo
others
in
your
use
of
cedar
Your
father
also
ate
and
drank
But
he
upheld
justice
and
righteousness
And
it
went
well
with
him
16
He
defended
the
legal
claim
of
the
afflicted
one
and
the
poor
one
So
that
it
went
well
Is
that
not
what
it
means
to
know
me
declares
Jehovah
17
But
your
eyes
and
heart
are
set
only
on
your
dishonest
gain
On
shedding
innocent
blood
And
on
committing
fraud
and
extortion
18
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
concerning
Jehoiakim
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
They
will
not
mourn
him
Alas
my
brother
Alas
my
sister
They
will
not
mourn
him
Alas
O
master
Alas
his
majesty
19
With
the
burial
of
a
donkey
he
will
be
buried
Dragged
about
and
thrown
away
Outside
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
20
Go
up
to
Lebanon
and
cry
out
Raise
your
voice
in
Bashan
And
cry
out
from
Abarim
For
all
your
passionate
lovers
have
been
crushed
21
I
spoke
to
you
when
you
felt
secure
But
you
said
I
will
not
obey
This
has
been
your
course
since
youth
For
you
have
not
obeyed
my
voice
22
A
wind
will
shepherd
all
your
shepherds
And
your
passionate
lovers
will
go
into
captivity
Then
you
will
be
put
to
shame
and
humiliated
because
of
all
your
calamity
23
O
you
who
dwell
in
Lebanon
Nestled
among
the
cedars
How
you
will
groan
when
pangs
come
on
you
Anguish
like
that
of
a
woman
giving
birth
24
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
Jehovah
even
if
Coniah
son
of
Jehoiakim
the
king
of
Judah
were
the
seal
ring
on
my
right
hand
I
would
pull
you
off
from
there
25
I
will
give
you
into
the
hand
of
those
seeking
to
take
your
life
into
the
hand
of
those
whom
you
fear
into
the
hand
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
and
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans
26
And
I
will
hurl
you
and
your
mother
who
gave
birth
to
you
into
another
land
where
you
were
not
born
and
there
you
will
die
27
And
they
will
never
return
to
the
land
they
yearn
for
28
Is
this
man
Coniah
just
a
despised
broken
pot
A
vessel
that
nobody
wants
Why
are
he
and
his
descendants
hurled
downAnd
thrown
into
a
land
they
do
not
know
29
O
earth
earth
earth
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
30
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Write
down
this
man
as
childless
As
a
man
who
will
not
have
any
success
during
his
lifetime
For
none
of
his
descendants
will
succeedIn
sitting
on
Davids
throne
and
ruling
again
in
Judah
1
Woe
to
the
shepherds
who
are
destroying
and
scattering
the
sheep
of
my
pasture
declares
Jehovah
2
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
against
the
shepherds
who
are
shepherding
my
people
You
have
scattered
my
sheep
you
kept
dispersing
them
and
you
have
not
turned
your
attention
to
them
So
I
will
turn
my
attention
to
you
because
of
your
evil
deeds

declares
Jehovah
3
Then
I
will
gather
together
the
remnant
of
my
sheep
from
all
the
lands
to
which
I
have
dispersed
them
and
I
will
bring
them
back
to
their
pasture
and
they
will
be
fruitful
and
become
many
4
And
I
will
raise
up
over
them
shepherds
who
will
really
shepherd
them
They
will
no
longer
be
afraid
or
be
terrified
and
none
will
be
missing

declares
Jehovah
5
Look
The
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
I
will
raise
up
to
David
a
righteous
sprout
And
a
king
will
reign
and
show
insight
and
uphold
justice
and
righteousness
in
the
land
6
In
his
days
Judah
will
be
saved
and
Israel
will
reside
in
security
And
this
is
the
name
by
which
he
will
be
called
Jehovah
Is
Our
Righteousness
7
However
the
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
they
will
no
longer
say
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
who
brought
the
people
of
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
8
but
rather
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
who
brought
out
and
brought
back
the
descendants
of
the
house
of
Israel
from
the
land
of
the
north
and
from
all
the
lands
to
which
I
had
dispersed
them

and
they
will
dwell
in
their
own
land
9
Concerning
the
prophets
My
heart
is
broken
within
me
All
my
bones
are
shaking
I
am
like
a
man
who
is
drunkAnd
like
a
man
overcome
by
wine
Because
of
Jehovah
and
because
of
his
holy
words
10
For
the
land
is
full
of
adulterers
Because
of
the
curse
the
land
has
gone
into
mourningAnd
the
pastures
of
the
wilderness
have
dried
up
Their
course
is
evil
and
they
abuse
their
power
11
Both
the
prophet
and
the
priest
are
polluted
Even
in
my
own
house
I
have
found
their
wickedness

declares
Jehovah
12
So
their
path
will
become
slippery
and
dark
They
will
be
pushed
and
will
fall
For
I
will
bring
calamity
on
themIn
the
year
of
reckoning

declares
Jehovah
13
And
in
the
prophets
of
Samaria
I
have
seen
what
is
repulsive
Their
prophecies
are
incited
by
Baal
And
they
lead
my
people
Israel
astray
14
And
in
the
prophets
of
Jerusalem
I
have
seen
horrible
things
They
commit
adultery
and
walk
in
falsehood
They
encourage
evildoers
And
they
do
not
turn
away
from
their
wickedness
To
me
they
are
all
like
Sodom
And
her
inhabitants
are
like
Gomorrah
15
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
against
the
prophets
Here
I
am
making
them
eat
wormwoodAnd
giving
them
poisoned
water
to
drink
For
from
the
prophets
of
Jerusalem
apostasy
has
spread
throughout
the
land
16
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Do
not
listen
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
who
are
prophesying
to
you
They
are
deluding
you
The
vision
they
speak
is
from
their
own
heart
Not
from
the
mouth
of
Jehovah
17
They
are
saying
again
and
again
to
those
who
disrespect
me
Jehovah
has
said
You
will
enjoy
peace
And
to
everyone
who
follows
his
own
stubborn
heart
they
say
No
calamity
will
come
upon
you
18
For
who
has
stood
in
the
inner
circle
of
JehovahTo
see
and
hear
his
word
Who
has
paid
attention
to
his
word
in
order
to
hear
it
19
Look
The
windstorm
of
Jehovah
will
burst
out
in
fury
Like
a
whirling
tempest
it
will
whirl
down
on
the
head
of
the
wicked
20
The
anger
of
Jehovah
will
not
turn
backUntil
he
has
carried
out
and
accomplished
the
intentions
of
his
heart
In
the
final
part
of
the
days
you
will
clearly
understand
this
21
I
did
not
send
the
prophets
yet
they
ran
I
did
not
speak
to
them
yet
they
prophesied
22
But
if
they
had
stood
in
my
inner
circle
They
would
have
made
my
people
hear
my
wordsAnd
would
have
caused
them
to
turn
back
from
their
bad
way
and
their
evil
deeds
23
Am
I
only
a
God
nearby

declares
Jehovah
and
not
a
God
also
from
far
away
24
Can
any
man
hide
in
a
concealed
place
where
I
cannot
see
him
declares
Jehovah
Do
I
not
fill
the
heavens
and
the
earth
declares
Jehovah
25
I
have
heard
the
prophets
who
are
prophesying
lies
in
my
name
say
I
had
a
dream
I
had
a
dream
26
How
long
will
this
continue
in
the
heart
of
the
prophets
to
prophesy
lies
They
are
prophets
of
the
deceit
of
their
own
heart
27
They
intend
to
make
my
people
forget
my
name
by
the
dreams
they
relate
to
one
another
just
as
their
fathers
forgot
my
name
because
of
Baal
28
Let
the
prophet
who
has
a
dream
relate
the
dream
but
the
one
who
has
my
word
should
speak
my
word
truthfully
What
does
the
straw
have
in
common
with
the
grain
declares
Jehovah
29
Is
not
my
word
just
like
a
fire

declares
Jehovah
and
like
a
forge
hammer
that
smashes
the
crag
30
So
here
I
am
against
the
prophets

declares
Jehovah
who
steal
my
words
from
one
another
31
Here
I
am
against
the
prophets

declares
Jehovah
those
who
use
their
tongue
to
say
He
declares
32
Here
I
am
against
the
prophets
of
lying
dreams

declares
Jehovah
who
relate
them
and
lead
my
people
astray
because
of
their
lies
and
their
boasting
But
I
did
not
send
them
or
command
them
So
they
will
not
benefit
this
people
at
all

declares
Jehovah
33
And
when
this
people
or
a
prophet
or
a
priest
asks
you
What
is
the
burden
of
Jehovah
you
should
reply
to
them
You
people
are
the
burden
And
I
will
cast
you
off

declares
Jehovah
34
As
for
the
prophet
or
the
priest
or
the
people
who
say
This
is
the
burden
of
Jehovah
I
will
turn
my
attention
on
that
man
and
on
his
household
35
This
is
what
each
of
you
is
saying
to
his
fellow
and
to
his
brother
What
has
Jehovah
answered
And
what
has
Jehovah
spoken
36
But
the
burden
of
Jehovah
you
should
mention
no
more
for
the
burden
is
each
ones
own
word
and
you
have
changed
the
words
of
the
living
God
Jehovah
of
armies
our
God
37
This
is
what
you
will
say
to
the
prophet
What
answer
has
Jehovah
given
you
And
what
has
Jehovah
spoken
38
And
if
you
keep
saying
The
burden
of
Jehovah
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Because
of
your
saying
This
word
is
the
burden
of
Jehovah

after
I
told
you
You
must
not
say
The
burden
of
Jehovah
39
look
I
will
lift
you
up
and
throw
you
away
from
my
presence
both
you
and
the
city
that
I
gave
to
you
and
your
forefathers
40
And
I
will
bring
on
you
everlasting
disgrace
and
everlasting
humiliation
which
will
not
be
forgotten
1
Then
Jehovah
showed
me
two
baskets
of
figs
set
before
the
temple
of
Jehovah
after
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
had
carried
into
exile
Jeconiah
son
of
Jehoiakim
the
king
of
Judah
along
with
the
princes
of
Judah
the
craftsmen
and
the
metalworkers
he
took
them
from
Jerusalem
to
Babylon
2
One
basket
had
very
good
figs
like
early
figs
but
the
other
basket
had
very
bad
figs
so
bad
that
they
could
not
be
eaten
3
Jehovah
then
asked
me
What
do
you
see
Jeremiah
So
I
said
Figs
the
good
figs
are
very
good
but
the
bad
ones
are
very
bad
so
bad
that
they
cannot
be
eaten
4
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
5
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Like
these
good
figs
so
I
will
regard
in
a
good
way
the
exiles
of
Judah
whom
I
have
sent
away
from
this
place
to
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
6
I
will
keep
my
eye
on
them
for
their
good
and
I
will
cause
them
to
return
to
this
land
I
will
build
them
up
and
I
will
not
tear
down
I
will
plant
them
and
I
will
not
uproot
7
And
I
will
give
them
a
heart
to
know
me
that
I
am
Jehovah
They
will
become
my
people
and
I
will
become
their
God
for
they
will
return
to
me
with
all
their
heart
8
But
concerning
the
bad
figs
that
are
so
bad
they
cannot
be
eaten
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
So
I
will
regard
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
his
princes
the
remnant
of
Jerusalem
who
are
left
in
this
land
and
those
who
are
dwelling
in
the
land
of
Egypt
9
I
will
make
them
an
object
of
horror
and
calamity
to
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
a
reproach
a
proverbial
saying
a
cause
for
ridicule
and
a
curse
in
all
the
places
to
which
I
disperse
them
10
And
I
will
send
against
them
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
until
they
have
perished
from
the
land
that
I
gave
to
them
and
to
their
forefathers
1
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
concerning
all
the
people
of
Judah
in
the
fourth
year
of
Jehoiakim
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
which
was
the
first
year
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
2
This
is
what
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spoke
concerning
all
the
people
of
Judah
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
3
From
the
13th
year
of
Josiah
son
of
Amon
the
king
of
Judah
to
this
day
these
23
years
the
word
of
Jehovah
has
come
to
me
and
I
kept
speaking
to
you
again
and
again
but
you
would
not
listen
4
And
Jehovah
sent
all
his
servants
the
prophets
to
you
sending
them
again
and
again
but
you
would
not
listen
or
incline
your
ear
to
hear
5
They
would
say
Turn
back
please
each
of
you
from
your
evil
ways
and
your
evil
deeds
then
you
will
continue
dwelling
for
a
long
time
to
come
in
the
land
that
Jehovah
long
ago
gave
to
you
and
to
your
forefathers
6
Do
not
follow
other
gods
and
serve
them
and
bow
down
to
them
offending
me
with
the
work
of
your
hands
otherwise
I
will
bring
calamity
on
you
7
But
you
would
not
listen
to
me

declares
Jehovah
Instead
you
offended
me
with
the
work
of
your
hands
to
your
own
calamity
8
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Because
you
would
not
obey
my
words
9
I
am
sending
for
all
the
families
of
the
north

declares
Jehovah
sending
for
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
my
servant
and
I
will
bring
them
against
this
land
and
against
its
inhabitants
and
against
all
these
surrounding
nations
I
will
devote
them
to
destruction
and
make
them
an
object
of
horror
and
something
to
whistle
at
and
a
perpetual
ruin
10
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
sound
of
exultation
and
the
sound
of
rejoicing
from
them
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
the
sound
of
the
hand
mill
and
the
light
of
the
lamp
11
And
all
this
land
will
be
reduced
to
ruins
and
will
become
an
object
of
horror
and
these
nations
will
have
to
serve
the
king
of
Babylon
for
70
years
12
But
when
70
years
have
been
fulfilled
I
will
call
to
account
the
king
of
Babylon
and
that
nation
for
their
error

declares
Jehovah
and
I
will
make
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
a
desolate
wasteland
for
all
time
13
I
will
bring
on
that
land
all
my
words
that
I
have
spoken
against
it
all
that
is
written
in
this
book
that
Jeremiah
has
prophesied
against
all
the
nations
14
For
many
nations
and
great
kings
will
make
slaves
of
them
and
I
will
repay
them
according
to
their
deeds
and
the
work
of
their
own
hands
15
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
said
to
me
Take
this
cup
of
the
wine
of
wrath
out
of
my
hand
and
make
all
the
nations
to
whom
I
send
you
drink
it
16
And
they
will
drink
and
stagger
and
act
like
madmen
because
of
the
sword
that
I
am
sending
among
them
17
So
I
took
the
cup
out
of
the
hand
of
Jehovah
and
made
all
the
nations
to
whom
Jehovah
sent
me
drink
18
starting
with
Jerusalem
and
the
cities
of
Judah
her
kings
and
her
princes
to
make
them
a
ruin
an
object
of
horror
something
to
whistle
at
and
a
curse
as
it
is
today
19
then
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
his
servants
his
princes
and
all
his
people
20
and
all
their
mixed
populations
all
the
kings
of
the
land
of
Uz
all
the
kings
of
the
land
of
the
Philistines
Ashkelon
Gaza
Ekron
and
those
remaining
of
Ashdod
21
Edom
Moab
and
the
Ammonites
22
all
the
kings
of
Tyre
all
the
kings
of
Sidon
and
the
kings
of
the
island
in
the
sea
23
Dedan
Tema
Buz
and
all
those
with
hair
clipped
at
the
temples
24
all
the
kings
of
the
Arabians
and
all
the
kings
of
the
mixed
populations
who
reside
in
the
wilderness
25
all
the
kings
of
Zimri
all
the
kings
of
Elam
and
all
the
kings
of
the
Medes
26
and
all
the
kings
of
the
north
near
and
far
one
after
the
other
and
all
the
other
kingdoms
of
the
earth
that
are
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
the
king
of
Sheshach
will
drink
after
them
27
And
you
must
say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Drink
and
get
drunk
and
vomit
and
fall
so
that
you
cannot
get
up
because
of
the
sword
that
I
am
sending
among
you
28
And
if
they
refuse
to
take
the
cup
out
of
your
hand
to
drink
say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
You
must
drink
it
29
For
look
if
I
am
bringing
calamity
first
on
the
city
that
bears
my
name
should
you
go
unpunished
You
will
not
go
unpunished
for
I
am
calling
for
a
sword
against
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
30
And
you
are
to
prophesy
all
these
words
to
them
and
say
to
them
From
on
high
Jehovah
will
roar
And
from
his
holy
dwelling
he
will
make
his
voice
heard
He
will
roar
loudly
against
his
abiding
place
Shouting
like
those
treading
the
winepress
He
will
sing
triumphantly
against
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
31
A
noise
will
resound
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
For
Jehovah
has
a
controversy
with
the
nations
He
will
personally
pass
judgment
on
all
humans
And
he
will
put
the
wicked
to
the
sword

declares
Jehovah
32
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Look
A
calamity
is
spreading
from
nation
to
nation
And
a
great
tempest
will
be
unleashed
from
the
remotest
parts
of
the
earth
33
And
those
slain
by
Jehovah
in
that
day
will
be
from
one
end
of
the
earth
clear
to
the
other
end
of
the
earth
They
will
not
be
mourned
nor
will
they
be
gathered
up
or
buried
They
will
become
like
manure
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
34
Wail
you
shepherds
and
cry
out
Wallow
about
you
majestic
ones
of
the
flock
Because
the
time
of
your
slaughter
and
your
dispersion
has
come
And
you
will
fall
like
a
precious
vessel
35
The
shepherds
have
no
place
to
flee
And
there
is
no
escape
for
the
majestic
ones
of
the
flock
36
Listen
The
outcry
of
the
shepherdsAnd
the
wailing
of
the
majestic
ones
of
the
flock
For
Jehovah
is
devastating
their
pasture
37
And
the
peaceful
dwelling
places
have
been
made
lifelessBecause
of
the
burning
anger
of
Jehovah
38
He
has
left
his
lair
just
like
a
young
lion
For
their
land
has
become
an
object
of
horrorBecause
of
the
cruel
swordAnd
because
of
his
burning
anger
1
In
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
Jehoiakim
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
this
word
came
from
Jehovah
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Stand
in
the
courtyard
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
speak
concerning
all
the
people
of
the
cities
of
Judah
who
are
coming
in
to
worship
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
Tell
them
everything
that
I
command
you
do
not
take
away
a
word
3
Perhaps
they
will
listen
and
each
one
will
turn
back
from
his
evil
way
and
I
will
change
my
mind
concerning
the
calamity
that
I
intend
to
bring
on
them
because
of
their
evil
deeds
4
Say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
If
you
will
not
listen
to
me
by
following
my
law
that
I
have
placed
before
you
5
by
listening
to
the
words
of
my
servants
the
prophets
whom
I
am
sending
to
you
again
and
again
whom
you
have
not
listened
to
6
then
I
will
make
this
house
like
Shiloh
and
I
will
make
this
city
an
object
of
cursing
to
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
7
And
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
heard
Jeremiah
speaking
these
words
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
8
So
when
Jeremiah
had
finished
speaking
all
that
Jehovah
had
commanded
him
to
speak
to
all
the
people
then
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
seized
him
and
said
You
will
surely
die
9
Why
have
you
prophesied
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
saying
This
house
will
become
like
Shiloh
and
this
city
will
be
devastated
and
left
without
an
inhabitant
And
all
the
people
gathered
around
Jeremiah
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
10
When
the
princes
of
Judah
heard
these
words
they
came
up
from
the
house
of
the
king
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
sat
down
at
the
entrance
of
the
new
gate
of
Jehovah
11
The
priests
and
the
prophets
said
to
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people
This
man
deserves
the
death
penalty
because
he
has
prophesied
against
this
city
just
as
you
have
heard
with
your
own
ears
12
Jeremiah
then
said
to
all
the
princes
and
to
all
the
people
It
was
Jehovah
who
sent
me
to
prophesy
against
this
house
and
against
this
city
all
the
words
that
you
have
heard
13
So
now
reform
your
ways
and
your
actions
and
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
Jehovah
will
change
his
mind
concerning
the
calamity
that
he
has
spoken
against
you
14
But
as
for
me
I
am
in
your
hand
Do
to
me
whatever
seems
good
and
right
in
your
eyes
15
Only
know
for
certain
that
if
you
put
me
to
death
you
will
bring
innocent
blood
upon
yourselves
and
upon
this
city
and
upon
her
inhabitants
for
in
truth
Jehovah
sent
me
to
you
to
speak
all
these
words
in
your
hearing
16
Then
the
princes
and
all
the
people
said
to
the
priests
and
the
prophets
This
man
does
not
deserve
the
death
penalty
for
he
spoke
to
us
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
our
God
17
Furthermore
some
of
the
elders
of
the
land
rose
up
and
began
saying
to
the
entire
congregation
of
the
people
18
Micah
of
Moresheth
was
prophesying
in
the
days
of
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
and
he
said
to
all
the
people
of
Judah
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Zion
will
be
plowed
up
as
a
field
Jerusalem
will
become
heaps
of
ruins
And
the
mountain
of
the
House
will
become
like
high
places
in
a
forest
19
Did
King
Hezekiah
of
Judah
and
all
Judah
then
put
him
to
death
Did
he
not
fear
Jehovah
and
beg
for
Jehovahs
favor
so
that
Jehovah
changed
his
mind
concerning
the
calamity
that
he
had
spoken
against
them
So
we
are
about
to
bring
a
great
calamity
on
ourselves
20
And
there
was
another
man
prophesying
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
Urijah
son
of
Shemaiah
from
Kiriath-jearim
who
prophesied
against
this
city
and
against
this
land
with
words
like
those
of
Jeremiah
21
King
Jehoiakim
and
all
his
mighty
men
and
all
the
princes
heard
his
words
and
the
king
sought
to
put
him
to
death
When
Urijah
heard
of
it
he
at
once
became
afraid
and
fled
to
Egypt
22
Then
King
Jehoiakim
sent
Elnathan
the
son
of
Achbor
and
other
men
with
him
to
Egypt
23
They
brought
Urijah
from
Egypt
and
took
him
to
King
Jehoiakim
who
then
struck
him
down
with
the
sword
and
cast
his
dead
body
into
the
graveyard
of
the
common
people
24
But
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
supported
Jeremiah
so
that
he
was
not
handed
over
to
the
people
to
be
put
to
death
1
In
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
Jehoiakim
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
this
word
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
has
told
me
Make
for
yourself
straps
and
yoke
bars
and
put
them
on
your
neck
3
Then
send
them
to
the
king
of
Edom
the
king
of
Moab
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
the
king
of
Tyre
and
the
king
of
Sidon
by
the
hand
of
the
messengers
who
have
come
to
Jerusalem
to
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
4
Give
them
this
command
for
their
masters
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
this
is
what
you
should
say
to
your
masters
5
It
is
I
who
made
the
earth
mankind
and
the
beasts
that
are
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
by
my
great
power
and
by
my
outstretched
arm
and
I
have
given
it
to
whomever
I
please
6
And
now
I
have
given
all
these
lands
into
the
hand
of
my
servant
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
even
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
I
have
given
him
to
serve
him
7
All
the
nations
will
serve
him
and
his
son
and
his
grandson
until
the
time
for
his
own
land
comes
when
many
nations
and
great
kings
will
make
him
their
slave
8
If
any
nation
or
kingdom
refuses
to
serve
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
and
refuses
to
put
its
neck
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon
I
will
punish
that
nation
with
the
sword
with
famine
and
with
pestilence

declares
Jehovah
until
I
have
finished
them
off
by
his
hand
9
Therefore
do
not
listen
to
your
prophets
your
diviners
your
dreamers
your
magicians
and
your
sorcerers
who
are
saying
to
you
You
will
not
serve
the
king
of
Babylon
10
For
they
are
prophesying
lies
to
you
so
that
you
will
be
taken
far
away
from
your
land
and
I
will
disperse
you
and
you
will
perish
11
But
the
nation
that
brings
its
neck
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
serves
him
I
will
allow
to
remain
on
its
land

declares
Jehovah
to
cultivate
it
and
dwell
in
it
12
Also
to
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
I
spoke
in
the
same
way
saying
Bring
your
necks
under
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
serve
him
and
his
people
and
you
will
keep
living
13
Why
should
you
and
your
people
die
by
the
sword
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
as
Jehovah
has
said
about
the
nation
that
will
not
serve
the
king
of
Babylon
14
Do
not
listen
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
who
are
saying
to
you
You
will
not
serve
the
king
of
Babylon

because
they
are
prophesying
lies
to
you
15
For
I
have
not
sent
them

declares
Jehovah
but
they
are
prophesying
lies
in
my
name
with
the
result
that
I
will
disperse
you
and
you
will
perish
you
and
the
prophets
who
are
prophesying
to
you
16
And
to
the
priests
and
to
all
this
people
I
said
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Do
not
listen
to
the
words
of
your
prophets
who
are
prophesying
to
you
Look
The
utensils
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
will
be
brought
back
from
Babylon
very
soon
for
they
are
prophesying
lies
to
you
17
Do
not
listen
to
them
Serve
the
king
of
Babylon
and
you
will
keep
living
Why
should
this
city
become
a
ruin
18
But
if
they
are
prophets
and
if
the
word
of
Jehovah
is
with
them
please
let
them
beg
Jehovah
of
armies
that
the
remaining
utensils
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem
may
not
be
taken
away
to
Babylon
19
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
concerning
the
pillars
the
Sea
the
carriages
and
the
remaining
utensils
that
are
left
in
this
city
20
which
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
did
not
take
when
he
took
into
exile
Jeconiah
son
of
Jehoiakim
the
king
of
Judah
from
Jerusalem
to
Babylon
together
with
all
the
nobles
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
21
yes
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
concerning
the
utensils
that
are
left
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah
and
in
Jerusalem
22
To
Babylon
they
will
be
brought
and
there
they
will
remain
until
the
day
I
turn
my
attention
to
them

declares
Jehovah
Then
I
will
bring
them
back
and
restore
them
to
this
place
1
In
that
same
year
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
in
the
fourth
year
in
the
fifth
month
the
prophet
Hananiah
the
son
of
Azzur
from
Gibeon
said
to
me
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
the
presence
of
the
priests
and
all
the
people
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
I
will
break
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon
3
Within
two
years
I
am
bringing
back
to
this
place
all
the
utensils
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
that
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
took
from
this
place
and
brought
to
Babylon
4
And
I
will
bring
back
to
this
place
Jeconiah
son
of
Jehoiakim
the
king
of
Judah
and
all
the
exiles
of
Judah
who
have
gone
to
Babylon

declares
Jehovah
for
I
will
break
the
yoke
of
the
king
of
Babylon
5
Then
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spoke
to
Hananiah
the
prophet
in
the
presence
of
the
priests
and
all
the
people
who
were
standing
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
6
Jeremiah
the
prophet
said
Amen
May
Jehovah
do
this
May
Jehovah
fulfill
your
words
that
you
prophesied
by
bringing
back
from
Babylon
to
this
place
the
utensils
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
all
the
exiled
people
7
However
hear
please
this
message
that
I
am
speaking
in
your
ears
and
in
the
ears
of
all
the
people
8
Long
ago
the
prophets
who
were
prior
to
me
and
prior
to
you
used
to
prophesy
concerning
many
lands
and
great
kingdoms
about
war
calamity
and
pestilence
9
If
a
prophet
prophesies
about
peace
and
the
word
of
that
prophet
comes
true
then
it
will
be
known
that
Jehovah
truly
sent
that
prophet
10
At
that
Hananiah
the
prophet
took
the
yoke
bar
off
the
neck
of
the
prophet
Jeremiah
and
broke
it
11
Hananiah
then
said
in
the
presence
of
all
the
people
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Just
like
this
I
will
break
the
yoke
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
from
off
the
neck
of
all
the
nations
within
two
years
And
Jeremiah
the
prophet
went
on
his
way
12
After
Hananiah
the
prophet
had
broken
the
yoke
bar
from
off
the
neck
of
Jeremiah
the
prophet
this
message
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jeremiah
13
Go
and
say
to
Hananiah
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
have
broken
yoke
bars
of
wood
but
instead
of
them
you
will
make
yoke
bars
of
iron
14
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
I
will
put
an
iron
yoke
bar
on
the
neck
of
all
these
nations
to
serve
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
and
they
must
serve
him
Even
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
I
will
give
him
15
Jeremiah
the
prophet
then
said
to
Hananiah
the
prophet
Listen
please
O
Hananiah
Jehovah
has
not
sent
you
but
you
have
caused
this
people
to
trust
in
a
lie
16
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Look
I
am
removing
you
from
the
face
of
the
ground
This
year
you
will
die
for
you
have
urged
rebellion
against
Jehovah
17
So
Hananiah
the
prophet
died
in
that
year
in
the
seventh
month
1
These
are
the
words
of
the
letter
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
sent
from
Jerusalem
to
the
rest
of
the
elders
among
the
exiled
people
the
priests
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
whom
Nebuchadnezzar
had
taken
into
exile
from
Jerusalem
to
Babylon
2
after
King
Jeconiah
the
queen
mother
the
court
officials
the
princes
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
and
the
craftsmen
and
the
metalworkers
had
gone
out
of
Jerusalem
3
He
sent
the
letter
by
the
hand
of
Elasah
the
son
of
Shaphan
and
Gemariah
the
son
of
Hilkiah
whom
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
sent
to
Babylon
to
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
It
said
4
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
to
all
the
exiled
people
whom
I
have
caused
to
go
into
exile
from
Jerusalem
to
Babylon
5
Build
houses
and
live
in
them
Plant
gardens
and
eat
their
fruit
6
Take
wives
and
have
sons
and
daughters
take
wives
for
your
sons
and
give
your
daughters
in
marriage
so
that
they
too
may
have
sons
and
daughters
Become
many
there
and
do
not
decrease
7
And
seek
the
peace
of
the
city
to
which
I
have
exiled
you
and
pray
in
its
behalf
to
Jehovah
for
in
its
peace
you
will
have
peace
8
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Do
not
let
your
prophets
and
your
diviners
who
are
among
you
deceive
you
and
do
not
listen
to
the
dreams
that
they
are
dreaming
9
For
they
are
prophesying
lies
to
you
in
my
name
I
have
not
sent
them

declares
Jehovah
10
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
When
70
years
at
Babylon
are
fulfilled
I
will
turn
my
attention
to
you
and
I
will
make
good
my
promise
by
bringing
you
back
to
this
place
11
For
I
well
know
the
thoughts
that
I
am
thinking
toward
you

declares
Jehovah
thoughts
of
peace
and
not
of
calamity
to
give
you
a
future
and
a
hope
12
And
you
will
call
me
and
come
and
pray
to
me
and
I
will
listen
to
you
13
You
will
seek
me
and
find
me
for
you
will
search
for
me
with
all
your
heart
14
And
I
will
let
you
find
me

declares
Jehovah
And
I
will
gather
your
captives
and
collect
you
together
out
of
all
the
nations
and
places
to
which
I
have
dispersed
you

declares
Jehovah
And
I
will
bring
you
back
to
the
place
from
which
I
caused
you
to
go
into
exile
15
But
you
have
said
Jehovah
has
raised
up
prophets
for
us
in
Babylon
16
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
to
the
king
sitting
on
the
throne
of
David
and
to
all
the
people
dwelling
in
this
city
your
brothers
who
have
not
gone
with
you
into
exile
17
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Here
I
am
sending
against
them
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
and
I
will
make
them
like
rotten
figs
that
are
so
bad
they
cannot
be
eaten
18
And
I
will
pursue
them
with
the
sword
with
famine
and
with
pestilence
and
I
will
make
them
an
object
of
horror
to
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
and
a
curse
and
an
object
of
astonishment
something
to
whistle
at
and
a
reproach
among
all
the
nations
to
which
I
disperse
them
19
because
they
have
not
listened
to
my
words
that
I
sent
to
them
with
my
servants
the
prophets

declares
Jehovah
sending
them
again
and
again
But
you
have
not
listened

declares
Jehovah
20
Therefore
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
all
you
exiled
people
whom
I
have
sent
away
from
Jerusalem
to
Babylon
21
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
concerning
Ahab
the
son
of
Kolaiah
and
concerning
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Maaseiah
who
are
prophesying
lies
to
you
in
my
name
Here
I
am
giving
them
into
the
hand
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
and
he
will
strike
them
down
before
your
eyes
22
And
what
happens
to
them
will
become
a
curse
spoken
by
all
the
exiles
of
Judah
in
Babylon
May
Jehovah
make
you
like
Zedekiah
and
like
Ahab
whom
the
king
of
Babylon
roasted
in
the
fire
23
for
they
have
acted
disgracefully
in
Israel
committing
adultery
with
the
wives
of
their
neighbors
and
speaking
false
words
in
my
name
that
I
did
not
command
them
I
am
the
One
who
knows
and
I
am
a
witness

declares
Jehovah
24
And
to
Shemaiah
of
Nehelam
you
will
say
25
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Because
you
sent
in
your
name
letters
to
all
the
people
who
are
in
Jerusalem
to
Zephaniah
son
of
Maaseiah
the
priest
and
to
all
the
priests
saying
26
Jehovah
has
made
you
priest
instead
of
Jehoiada
the
priest
to
become
the
overseer
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
to
be
in
charge
of
any
madman
who
acts
like
a
prophet
and
to
put
him
into
the
stocks
and
into
the
pillory
27
why
then
have
you
not
rebuked
Jeremiah
of
Anathoth
who
is
acting
as
a
prophet
for
you
28
For
he
even
sent
to
us
at
Babylon
saying
It
will
be
a
long
time
Build
houses
and
live
in
them
Plant
gardens
and
eat
their
fruit
—
29
When
Zephaniah
the
priest
read
this
letter
in
the
hearing
of
Jeremiah
the
prophet
30
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jeremiah
saying
31
Send
to
all
the
exiled
people
saying
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
concerning
Shemaiah
of
Nehelam
Because
Shemaiah
prophesied
to
you
though
I
did
not
send
him
and
he
tried
to
make
you
trust
in
lies
32
therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
turning
my
attention
to
Shemaiah
of
Nehelam
and
his
descendants
Not
one
man
of
his
will
survive
among
this
people
and
he
will
not
see
the
good
that
I
will
do
for
my
people

declares
Jehovah
for
he
has
urged
rebellion
against
Jehovah
1
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Write
in
a
book
all
the
words
that
I
speak
to
you
3
For
look
the
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
I
will
gather
the
captives
of
my
people
Israel
and
Judah

says
Jehovah
and
I
will
bring
them
back
to
the
land
that
I
gave
to
their
forefathers
and
they
will
possess
it
once
again
4
These
are
the
words
that
Jehovah
spoke
to
Israel
and
Judah

5
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
We
have
heard
the
sounds
of
trembling
There
is
terror
and
no
peace

6
Ask
please
whether
a
man
can
give
birth
Why
then
do
I
see
every
strong
man
with
his
hands
on
his
stomachLike
a
woman
giving
birth
Why
has
every
face
turned
pale

7
Alas
For
that
day
is
a
terrible
one
There
is
none
like
it
A
time
of
distress
for
Jacob
But
he
will
be
saved
out
of
it
8
And
in
that
day

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
I
will
break
the
yoke
from
off
your
neck
and
your
straps
I
will
tear
in
two
and
no
more
will
strangers
make
him
their
slave
9
They
will
serve
Jehovah
their
God
and
David
their
king
whom
I
will
raise
up
for
them
10
And
you
my
servant
Jacob
do
not
be
afraid

declares
Jehovah
And
do
not
be
terrified
O
Israel
For
I
will
save
you
from
far
awayAnd
your
offspring
from
the
land
of
their
captivity
Jacob
will
return
and
be
calm
and
undisturbed
With
no
one
to
make
them
afraid
11
For
I
am
with
you

declares
Jehovah
to
save
you
But
I
will
make
an
extermination
among
all
the
nations
to
which
I
scattered
you
However
you
I
will
not
exterminate
I
will
discipline
you
to
the
proper
degree
And
I
will
by
no
means
leave
you
unpunished
12
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
There
is
no
cure
for
your
breakdown
Your
wound
is
incurable
13
There
is
no
one
to
plead
your
cause
No
means
of
healing
your
ulcer
There
is
no
cure
for
you
14
All
your
passionate
lovers
have
forgotten
you
They
no
longer
seek
you
out
For
with
the
stroke
of
an
enemy
I
have
struck
you
With
the
punishment
of
someone
cruel
Because
of
your
great
guilt
and
your
many
sins
15
Why
do
you
cry
out
because
of
your
breakdown
Your
pain
is
incurable
Because
of
your
great
guilt
and
your
many
sinsI
have
done
this
to
you
16
Therefore
all
those
devouring
you
will
be
devoured
And
all
your
enemies
will
also
go
into
captivity
Those
pillaging
you
will
be
pillaged
And
I
will
hand
all
those
plundering
you
over
to
plundering
17
But
I
will
restore
your
health
and
heal
your
wounds

declares
Jehovah
Though
they
called
you
an
outcast
Zion
for
whom
no
one
searches
18
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
gathering
the
captives
of
the
tents
of
Jacob
And
I
will
have
pity
for
his
tabernacles
The
city
will
be
rebuilt
on
her
mound
And
the
fortified
tower
will
stand
on
its
rightful
site
19
And
from
them
will
come
thanksgiving
and
the
sounds
of
laughter
I
will
multiply
them
and
they
will
not
be
few
I
will
make
them
numerous
And
they
will
not
be
insignificant
20
His
sons
will
become
as
in
the
past
And
before
me
his
assembly
will
be
firmly
established
I
will
deal
with
all
his
oppressors
21
His
majestic
one
will
be
one
of
his
own
And
from
his
midst
his
ruler
will
emerge
I
will
cause
him
to
come
near
and
he
will
approach
me
For
otherwise
who
would
dare
to
approach
me
declares
Jehovah
22
And
you
will
become
my
people
and
I
will
be
your
God
23
Look
A
windstorm
of
Jehovah
will
burst
out
in
fury
A
sweeping
tempest
that
whirls
down
on
the
head
of
the
wicked
24
The
burning
anger
of
Jehovah
will
not
turn
backUntil
he
has
carried
out
and
accomplished
the
intentions
of
his
heart
In
the
final
part
of
the
days
you
will
understand
this
1
At
that
time

declares
Jehovah
I
will
become
God
to
all
the
families
of
Israel
and
they
will
become
my
people

2
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
The
people
who
survived
the
sword
found
favor
in
the
wildernessWhen
Israel
was
walking
to
his
resting-place

3
From
far
away
Jehovah
appeared
to
me
and
said
I
have
loved
you
with
an
everlasting
love
That
is
why
I
have
drawn
you
to
me
with
loyal
love

4
Yet
again
I
will
rebuild
you
and
you
will
be
rebuilt
O
virgin
of
Israel
you
will
again
take
up
your
tambourinesAnd
go
forth
dancing
joyfully

5
You
will
again
plant
vineyards
in
the
mountains
of
Samaria
The
planters
will
plant
and
enjoy
their
fruit

6
For
the
day
will
come
when
the
watchmen
in
the
mountains
of
Ephraim
will
call
out
Rise
up
let
us
go
up
to
Zion
to
Jehovah
our
God

7
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Cry
out
to
Jacob
with
rejoicing
Shout
for
joy
because
you
are
over
the
nations
Proclaim
it
offer
praise
and
say
O
Jehovah
save
your
people
the
remnant
of
Israel

8
I
am
bringing
them
back
from
the
land
of
the
north
I
will
gather
them
together
from
the
remotest
parts
of
the
earth
Among
them
will
be
the
blind
and
the
lame
The
pregnant
woman
and
the
one
giving
birth
all
together
As
a
great
congregation
they
will
return
here

9
They
will
come
weeping
I
will
lead
them
as
they
beg
for
favor
I
will
guide
them
to
streams
of
water
On
a
level
path
that
will
not
make
them
stumble
For
I
am
a
Father
to
Israel
and
Ephraim
is
my
firstborn
10
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
you
nations
And
proclaim
it
among
the
islands
far
away
The
One
who
scattered
Israel
will
gather
him
together
He
will
watch
over
him
as
a
shepherd
does
his
flock
11
For
Jehovah
will
redeem
JacobAnd
rescue
him
out
of
the
hand
of
the
one
stronger
than
he
is
12
They
will
come
and
shout
joyfully
on
the
height
of
ZionAnd
become
radiant
over
the
goodness
of
Jehovah
Over
the
grain
and
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
And
over
the
young
of
the
flock
and
the
herd
They
will
become
like
a
well-watered
garden
And
they
will
never
languish
again
13
At
that
time
the
virgin
will
dance
joyfully
Also
the
young
men
and
the
old
men
together
I
will
change
their
mourning
into
exultation
I
will
comfort
them
and
give
them
joy
instead
of
their
grief
14
I
will
satisfy
the
priests
with
plenty
And
my
people
will
be
satisfied
with
my
goodness

declares
Jehovah
15
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
A
voice
is
heard
in
Ramah
lamentation
and
bitter
weeping
Rachel
is
weeping
over
her
sons
She
has
refused
to
be
comforted
over
her
sons
Because
they
are
no
more
16
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Hold
back
your
voice
from
weeping
and
your
eyes
from
tears
For
there
is
a
reward
for
your
activity

declares
Jehovah
They
will
return
from
the
land
of
the
enemy
17
And
there
is
a
hope
for
your
future

declares
Jehovah
Your
sons
will
return
to
their
own
territory
18
I
have
surely
heard
Ephraims
moaning
You
have
corrected
me
and
I
have
been
corrected
Like
a
calf
that
has
not
been
trained
Bring
me
back
and
I
will
readily
turn
back
For
you
are
Jehovah
my
God
19
For
after
my
turning
back
I
felt
remorse
After
I
was
made
to
understand
I
struck
my
thigh
in
grief
I
was
ashamed
and
humiliated
For
I
bore
the
reproach
of
my
youth
20
Is
Ephraim
not
a
precious
son
to
me
a
beloved
child
For
as
often
as
I
speak
against
him
I
do
remember
him
still
That
is
why
my
emotions
are
stirred
for
him
And
I
will
surely
have
pity
on
him

declares
Jehovah
21
Set
up
road
markers
for
yourself
And
put
up
signposts
Pay
attention
to
the
highway
the
way
that
you
have
to
go
Return
O
virgin
of
Israel
return
to
these
cities
of
yours
22
How
long
will
you
waver
O
unfaithful
daughter
For
Jehovah
has
created
something
new
in
the
earth
A
woman
will
eagerly
pursue
a
man
23
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
They
will
again
say
these
words
in
the
land
of
Judah
and
in
its
cities
when
I
gather
back
their
captives
May
Jehovah
bless
you
O
righteous
dwelling
place
O
holy
mountain
24
And
in
it
Judah
and
all
its
cities
will
dwell
all
together
farmers
and
those
who
lead
the
flocks
25
For
I
will
satisfy
the
weary
one
and
fill
each
one
who
is
languishing
26
At
this
I
awoke
and
opened
my
eyes
and
my
sleep
had
been
pleasurable
to
me
27
Look
The
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
I
will
sow
the
house
of
Israel
and
the
house
of
Judah
with
the
seed
of
man
and
with
the
seed
of
livestock
28
And
just
as
I
watched
over
them
to
uproot
to
pull
down
to
tear
down
to
destroy
and
to
do
harm
so
I
will
watch
over
them
to
build
up
and
to
plant

declares
Jehovah
29
In
those
days
they
will
no
longer
say
The
fathers
ate
sour
grapes
but
the
teeth
of
the
sons
were
set
on
edge
30
But
then
each
one
will
die
for
his
own
error
Any
man
eating
sour
grapes
will
have
his
own
teeth
set
on
edge
31
Look
The
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
I
will
make
with
the
house
of
Israel
and
with
the
house
of
Judah
a
new
covenant
32
It
will
not
be
like
the
covenant
that
I
made
with
their
forefathers
on
the
day
I
took
hold
of
their
hand
to
lead
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
my
covenant
that
they
broke
although
I
was
their
true
master

declares
Jehovah
33
For
this
is
the
covenant
that
I
will
make
with
the
house
of
Israel
after
those
days

declares
Jehovah
I
will
put
my
law
within
them
and
in
their
heart
I
will
write
it
And
I
will
become
their
God
and
they
will
become
my
people
34
And
they
will
no
longer
teach
each
one
his
neighbor
and
each
one
his
brother
saying
Know
Jehovah
for
they
will
all
know
me
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
of
them

declares
Jehovah
For
I
will
forgive
their
error
and
I
will
no
longer
remember
their
sin
35
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Who
gives
the
sun
for
light
by
day
The
laws
of
the
moon
and
the
stars
for
light
by
night
Who
stirs
up
the
sea
and
makes
its
waves
boisterous
Whose
name
is
Jehovah
of
armies
36
If
these
regulations
should
ever
fail

declares
Jehovah
Only
then
would
the
offspring
of
Israel
cease
as
a
nation
before
me
always
37
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
If
the
heavens
above
could
be
measured
and
the
foundations
of
the
earth
below
could
be
explored
only
then
could
I
reject
all
the
offspring
of
Israel
for
all
they
have
done

declares
Jehovah
38
Look
The
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
the
city
will
be
built
to
Jehovah
from
the
Tower
of
Hananel
to
the
Corner
Gate
39
And
the
measuring
line
will
go
out
straight
ahead
to
the
hill
of
Gareb
and
it
will
turn
toward
Goah
40
And
all
the
valley
of
the
carcasses
and
of
ashes
and
all
the
terraces
as
far
as
the
Kidron
Valley
clear
to
the
corner
of
the
Horse
Gate
toward
the
east
will
be
something
holy
to
Jehovah
It
will
never
again
be
uprooted
or
torn
down
1
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
in
the
10th
year
of
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
that
is
the
18th
year
of
Nebuchadnezzar
2
At
that
time
the
armies
of
the
king
of
Babylon
were
besieging
Jerusalem
and
Jeremiah
the
prophet
was
confined
in
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah
3
For
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
had
confined
him
saying
Why
do
you
prophesy
like
this
You
say
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
will
give
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
he
will
capture
it
4
and
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
will
not
escape
from
the
Chaldeans
for
he
will
surely
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
he
will
speak
to
him
face-to-face
and
see
him
eye
to
eye
5
He
will
take
Zedekiah
to
Babylon
and
there
he
will
remain
until
I
turn
my
attention
to
him

declares
Jehovah
Although
you
keep
fighting
against
the
Chaldeans
you
will
not
succeed
6
Jeremiah
said
The
word
of
Jehovah
has
come
to
me
saying
7
Here
Hanamel
the
son
of
Shallum
your
uncle
will
come
to
you
and
say
Buy
for
yourself
my
field
in
Anathoth
because
you
have
the
first
right
to
repurchase
it
8
Hanamel
the
son
of
my
uncle
came
to
me
just
as
Jehovah
had
said
into
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
and
he
said
to
me
Please
buy
my
field
in
Anathoth
in
the
land
of
Benjamin
for
you
have
the
right
to
take
possession
of
it
and
to
repurchase
it
Buy
it
for
yourself
At
that
I
knew
that
this
was
by
the
word
of
Jehovah
9
So
I
bought
the
field
in
Anathoth
from
Hanamel
the
son
of
my
uncle
I
weighed
out
the
money
to
him
seven
shekels
and
ten
silver
pieces
10
Then
I
recorded
it
in
a
deed
affixed
the
seal
called
in
witnesses
and
weighed
the
money
in
the
scales
11
I
took
the
deed
of
purchase
the
one
that
was
sealed
according
to
the
commandment
and
legal
requirements
as
well
as
the
one
that
was
left
unsealed
12
and
I
gave
the
deed
of
purchase
to
Baruch
son
of
Neriah
son
of
Mahseiah
in
the
presence
of
Hanamel
the
son
of
my
uncle
the
witnesses
who
wrote
in
the
deed
of
purchase
and
all
the
Jews
who
were
sitting
in
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
13
I
now
commanded
Baruch
in
their
presence
saying
14
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Take
these
deeds
this
deed
of
purchase
the
sealed
one
and
the
other
deed
left
unsealed
and
put
them
into
an
earthenware
vessel
so
that
they
may
be
kept
for
a
long
time
15
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Houses
and
fields
and
vineyards
will
again
be
bought
in
this
land
16
Then
I
prayed
to
Jehovah
after
giving
the
deed
of
purchase
to
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
saying
17
Alas
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Look
You
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
by
your
great
power
and
by
your
outstretched
arm
Nothing
is
too
wonderful
for
you
18
the
One
showing
loyal
love
to
thousands
but
repaying
the
error
of
the
fathers
to
their
sons
after
them
the
true
God
the
great
and
mighty
One
whose
name
is
Jehovah
of
armies
19
You
are
great
in
counsel
and
mighty
in
deed
you
whose
eyes
observe
all
the
ways
of
men
to
give
to
each
one
according
to
his
ways
and
according
to
what
he
does
20
You
have
performed
signs
and
miracles
in
the
land
of
Egypt
which
are
known
down
to
this
day
and
thus
you
have
made
a
name
for
yourself
in
Israel
and
among
mankind
as
it
is
today
21
And
you
brought
your
people
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
with
signs
with
miracles
with
a
mighty
hand
with
an
outstretched
arm
and
with
terrifying
deeds
22
In
time
you
gave
them
this
land
that
you
swore
to
give
to
their
forefathers
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
23
And
they
came
in
and
took
possession
of
it
but
they
did
not
obey
your
voice
or
walk
in
your
law
They
did
not
do
anything
you
commanded
them
to
do
so
that
you
caused
all
this
calamity
to
befall
them
24
Look
Men
have
come
with
siege
ramparts
to
capture
the
city
and
because
of
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
the
city
will
certainly
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
Chaldeans
who
are
fighting
against
it
what
you
said
has
all
happened
as
you
now
see
25
But
you
have
told
me
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Buy
for
yourself
the
field
with
money
and
call
in
witnesses

although
the
city
will
certainly
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
Chaldeans
26
At
that
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jeremiah
saying
27
Here
I
am
Jehovah
the
God
of
all
mankind
Is
there
anything
too
wonderful
for
me
28
So
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
handing
this
city
over
to
the
Chaldeans
and
into
the
hand
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
and
he
will
capture
it
29
And
the
Chaldeans
fighting
against
this
city
will
come
in
and
set
this
city
on
fire
and
burn
it
down
along
with
the
houses
on
whose
roofs
the
people
offered
sacrifices
to
Baal
and
poured
out
drink
offerings
to
other
gods
to
offend
me
30
For
the
people
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
have
done
only
what
was
bad
in
my
eyes
from
their
youth
on
the
people
of
Israel
keep
offending
me
by
the
work
of
their
hands

declares
Jehovah
31
For
this
city
from
the
day
that
they
built
it
down
to
this
day
has
been
nothing
but
a
cause
of
anger
and
wrath
to
me
so
that
it
must
be
removed
from
before
my
face
32
because
of
all
the
evil
that
the
people
of
Israel
and
of
Judah
have
done
to
offend
me—they
their
kings
their
princes
their
priests
their
prophets
and
the
men
of
Judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
33
They
kept
turning
their
backs
to
me
not
their
faces
although
I
tried
to
teach
them
again
and
again
none
of
them
would
listen
to
receive
discipline
34
And
they
put
their
disgusting
idols
in
the
house
that
bears
my
name
in
order
to
defile
it
35
Furthermore
they
built
the
high
places
of
Baal
in
the
Valley
of
the
Son
of
Hinnom
in
order
to
make
their
sons
and
their
daughters
pass
through
the
fire
to
Molech
something
that
I
had
not
commanded
them
and
that
had
never
come
into
my
heart
to
do
such
a
detestable
thing
causing
Judah
to
sin
36
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
concerning
this
city
that
you
are
saying
will
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
by
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
37
Here
I
will
gather
them
together
from
all
the
lands
where
I
dispersed
them
in
my
anger
and
in
my
wrath
and
in
great
indignation
and
I
will
bring
them
back
to
this
place
and
let
them
dwell
in
security
38
And
they
will
be
my
people
and
I
will
be
their
God
39
And
I
will
give
them
one
heart
and
one
way
so
that
they
may
always
fear
me
for
their
own
good
and
the
good
of
their
children
after
them
40
And
I
will
make
with
them
an
everlasting
covenant
that
I
will
not
turn
away
from
doing
good
to
them
and
I
will
put
the
fear
of
me
in
their
hearts
so
that
they
will
not
turn
away
from
me
41
I
will
exult
over
them
to
do
good
to
them
and
I
will
firmly
plant
them
in
this
land
with
all
my
heart
and
with
all
my
soul
42
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Just
as
I
have
brought
on
this
people
all
this
great
calamity
so
I
will
bring
on
them
all
the
goodness
that
I
am
promising
them
43
And
fields
will
again
be
bought
in
this
land
though
you
are
saying
It
is
a
wasteland
without
man
and
beast
and
it
has
been
handed
over
to
the
Chaldeans
44
Fields
will
be
bought
with
money
deeds
of
purchase
will
be
recorded
and
sealed
and
witnesses
will
be
called
in
the
land
of
Benjamin
in
the
areas
around
Jerusalem
in
the
cities
of
Judah
in
the
cities
of
the
mountainous
region
in
the
cities
of
the
lowland
and
in
the
cities
of
the
south
because
I
will
bring
back
their
captives

declares
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jeremiah
the
second
time
while
he
was
still
confined
in
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
saying
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
Maker
of
earth
says
Jehovah
who
formed
it
and
firmly
established
it
Jehovah
is
his
name
3
Call
to
me
and
I
will
answer
you
and
readily
tell
you
great
and
incomprehensible
things
that
you
have
not
known
4
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
concerning
the
houses
of
this
city
and
the
houses
of
the
kings
of
Judah
that
are
pulled
down
because
of
the
siege
ramparts
and
the
sword
5
and
concerning
those
who
are
coming
to
fight
the
Chaldeans
filling
these
places
with
the
carcasses
of
those
whom
I
struck
down
in
my
anger
and
in
my
wrath
those
whose
evil
has
caused
me
to
hide
my
face
from
this
city
6
Here
I
am
bringing
recuperation
and
health
to
her
and
I
will
heal
them
and
reveal
to
them
an
abundance
of
peace
and
truth
7
And
I
will
bring
back
the
captives
of
Judah
and
the
captives
of
Israel
and
I
will
build
them
up
as
I
did
at
the
start
8
And
I
will
purify
them
from
all
the
guilt
of
their
sins
against
me
and
I
will
forgive
all
the
guilt
of
their
sins
and
their
transgressions
against
me
9
And
she
will
become
to
me
a
name
of
exultation
a
praise
and
a
beauty
before
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
who
will
hear
of
all
the
goodness
that
I
bestow
on
them
And
they
will
be
in
dread
and
will
tremble
because
of
all
the
goodness
and
peace
that
I
will
bestow
on
her
10
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
In
this
place
that
you
will
say
is
a
wasteland
without
man
or
livestock
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
that
are
desolate
without
man
or
inhabitant
or
livestock
there
will
again
be
heard
11
the
sound
of
exultation
and
the
sound
of
rejoicing
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
voice
of
the
bride
the
voice
of
those
saying
Give
thanks
to
Jehovah
of
armies
for
Jehovah
is
good
his
loyal
love
endures
forever
They
will
bring
thanksgiving
offerings
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
for
I
will
bring
back
the
captives
of
the
land
as
at
the
start

says
Jehovah
12
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
In
this
wasteland
without
man
or
livestock
and
in
all
its
cities
there
will
again
be
pastures
for
the
shepherds
to
rest
their
flocks
13
In
the
cities
of
the
mountainous
region
in
the
cities
of
the
lowland
in
the
cities
of
the
south
in
the
land
of
Benjamin
in
the
areas
around
Jerusalem
and
in
the
cities
of
Judah
flocks
will
again
pass
under
the
hands
of
the
one
counting
them

says
Jehovah
14
Look
The
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
I
will
fulfill
the
good
promise
that
I
have
spoken
concerning
the
house
of
Israel
and
the
house
of
Judah
15
In
those
days
and
at
that
time
I
will
cause
to
sprout
for
David
a
righteous
sprout
and
he
will
execute
justice
and
righteousness
in
the
land
16
In
those
days
Judah
will
be
saved
and
Jerusalem
will
reside
in
security
And
this
is
what
she
will
be
called
Jehovah
Is
Our
Righteousness
17
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
There
will
never
fail
to
be
a
man
from
Davids
line
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
the
house
of
Israel
18
nor
will
the
Levitical
priests
ever
fail
to
have
a
man
stand
before
me
to
offer
whole
burnt
offerings
to
burn
grain
offerings
and
to
offer
sacrifices
19
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
Jeremiah
saying
20
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
If
you
could
break
my
covenant
regarding
the
day
and
my
covenant
regarding
the
night
to
prevent
day
and
night
from
coming
at
their
proper
time
21
only
then
could
my
covenant
with
my
servant
David
be
broken
so
that
he
should
not
have
a
son
ruling
as
king
on
his
throne
and
so
also
my
covenant
with
the
Levitical
priests
my
ministers
22
Just
as
the
army
of
the
heavens
cannot
be
counted
and
the
sand
of
the
sea
cannot
be
measured
so
I
will
multiply
the
offspring
of
my
servant
David
and
the
Levites
who
are
ministering
to
me
23
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
Jeremiah
saying
24
Have
you
not
taken
note
of
what
this
people
is
saying
Jehovah
will
reject
the
two
families
that
he
chose
And
they
are
treating
my
own
people
with
disrespect
and
they
no
longer
regard
them
as
a
nation
25
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Just
as
surely
as
I
have
established
my
covenant
regarding
the
day
and
the
night
the
laws
of
heaven
and
earth
26
so
I
will
never
reject
the
offspring
of
Jacob
and
of
my
servant
David
so
as
not
to
take
from
his
offspring
rulers
over
the
descendants
of
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
For
I
will
gather
back
their
captives
and
have
pity
on
them
1
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
when
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
and
all
his
army
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
under
his
dominion
and
all
the
peoples
were
fighting
against
Jerusalem
and
all
her
cities
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
Go
and
speak
to
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
and
tell
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
giving
this
city
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
he
will
burn
it
with
fire
3
And
you
will
not
escape
out
of
his
hand
for
you
will
without
fail
be
caught
and
handed
over
to
him
And
you
will
see
the
king
of
Babylon
eye
to
eye
and
he
will
speak
to
you
face-to-face
and
you
will
go
to
Babylon
4
However
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
O
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
concerning
you
You
will
not
die
by
the
sword
5
In
peace
you
will
die
and
they
will
make
a
burning
ceremony
for
you
as
they
did
for
your
fathers
the
former
kings
who
were
before
you
and
they
will
mourn
you
Alas
O
master
for
I
have
spoken
the
word

declares
Jehovah
6
Jeremiah
the
prophet
then
spoke
all
these
words
to
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
in
Jerusalem
7
when
the
armies
of
the
king
of
Babylon
were
fighting
against
Jerusalem
and
against
all
the
cities
of
Judah
that
were
left
against
Lachish
and
against
Azekah
for
they
were
the
only
fortified
cities
that
remained
of
the
cities
of
Judah
8
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
after
King
Zedekiah
had
made
a
covenant
with
all
the
people
in
Jerusalem
to
proclaim
liberty
to
them
9
that
everyone
should
free
his
Hebrew
slaves
male
and
female
so
that
no
one
would
keep
a
fellow
Jew
as
his
slave
10
So
all
the
princes
and
all
the
people
obeyed
They
had
entered
into
the
covenant
that
everyone
should
free
his
male
and
female
slaves
and
not
keep
them
as
slaves
any
longer
They
obeyed
and
let
them
go
11
However
they
later
brought
back
the
male
and
female
slaves
whom
they
had
freed
and
they
again
forced
them
back
into
slavery
12
So
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
13
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
I
made
a
covenant
with
your
forefathers
in
the
day
I
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
out
of
the
house
of
slavery
saying
14
At
the
end
of
seven
years
each
of
you
should
free
his
Hebrew
brother
who
was
sold
to
you
and
who
has
served
you
six
years
you
must
set
him
free
But
your
forefathers
did
not
listen
or
incline
their
ears
to
me
15
And
recently
you
yourselves
turned
around
and
did
what
was
right
in
my
eyes
by
proclaiming
liberty
to
your
fellow
men
and
you
made
a
covenant
before
me
in
the
house
that
bears
my
name
16
But
then
you
turned
around
and
profaned
my
name
by
bringing
back
your
male
and
female
slaves
whom
you
had
freed
according
to
their
desire
and
you
forced
them
back
into
slavery
17
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
have
not
obeyed
me
in
proclaiming
liberty
each
one
to
his
brother
and
to
his
fellow
man
So
I
will
now
proclaim
liberty
to
you

declares
Jehovah
to
the
sword
to
pestilence
and
to
famine
and
I
will
make
you
an
object
of
horror
to
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
18
And
this
is
what
will
happen
to
the
men
who
violated
my
covenant
by
not
carrying
out
the
words
of
the
covenant
that
they
made
before
me
when
they
cut
the
calf
in
two
and
passed
between
the
halves
19
namely
the
princes
of
Judah
the
princes
of
Jerusalem
the
court
officials
the
priests
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
who
passed
between
the
halves
of
the
calf
20
I
will
hand
them
over
to
their
enemies
and
to
those
seeking
to
take
their
lives
and
their
dead
bodies
will
become
food
for
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
for
the
beasts
of
the
earth
21
And
I
will
give
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
and
his
princes
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
and
into
the
hand
of
those
seeking
to
take
their
lives
and
into
the
hand
of
the
armies
of
the
king
of
Babylon
who
are
withdrawing
from
against
you
22
Here
I
will
give
the
order

declares
Jehovah
and
I
will
bring
them
back
to
this
city
and
they
will
fight
against
it
and
capture
it
and
burn
it
with
fire
and
the
cities
of
Judah
I
will
make
a
wasteland
without
an
inhabitant
1
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
in
the
days
of
Jehoiakim
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
saying
2
Go
to
the
house
of
the
Rechabites
and
speak
with
them
and
bring
them
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
into
one
of
the
dining
rooms
then
offer
them
wine
to
drink
3
So
I
took
Jaazaniah
the
son
of
Jeremiah
the
son
of
Habazziniah
his
brothers
all
his
sons
and
the
entire
house
of
the
Rechabites
4
into
the
house
of
Jehovah
I
brought
them
to
the
dining
room
of
the
sons
of
Hanan
the
son
of
Igdaliah
a
man
of
the
true
God
which
was
next
to
the
dining
room
of
the
princes
that
was
above
the
dining
room
of
Maaseiah
the
son
of
Shallum
the
doorkeeper
5
Then
I
put
cups
and
goblets
full
of
wine
before
the
men
of
the
house
of
the
Rechabites
and
said
to
them
Drink
wine
6
But
they
said
We
will
not
drink
wine
because
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
our
forefather
gave
us
this
command
Neither
you
nor
your
sons
must
ever
drink
wine
7
And
you
must
not
build
a
house
sow
seed
or
plant
or
obtain
a
vineyard
Instead
you
must
always
dwell
in
tents
so
that
you
may
live
for
a
long
time
in
the
land
where
you
are
residing
as
foreigners
8
So
we
continue
to
obey
the
voice
of
Jehonadab
the
son
of
our
forefather
Rechab
in
all
that
he
commanded
us
by
never
drinking
any
wine—we
our
wives
our
sons
and
our
daughters
9
And
we
do
not
build
houses
to
dwell
in
nor
do
we
have
vineyards
or
fields
or
seed
10
We
keep
living
in
tents
and
obeying
all
that
Jehonadab
our
forefather
commanded
us
11
But
when
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
came
up
against
the
land
we
said
Come
let
us
go
into
Jerusalem
to
escape
the
army
of
the
Chaldeans
and
of
the
Syrians

and
now
we
are
living
in
Jerusalem
12
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jeremiah
saying
13
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Go
and
say
to
the
men
of
Judah
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
Were
you
not
continually
urged
to
obey
my
words
declares
Jehovah
14
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
commanded
his
descendants
not
to
drink
wine
and
they
have
carried
out
his
words
by
not
drinking
it
to
this
day
thus
obeying
the
order
of
their
forefather
However
I
have
spoken
to
you
again
and
again
but
you
have
not
obeyed
me
15
And
I
kept
sending
all
my
servants
the
prophets
to
you
sending
them
again
and
again
saying
Turn
back
please
each
of
you
from
your
evil
ways
and
do
what
is
right
Do
not
walk
after
other
gods
and
serve
them
Then
you
will
keep
dwelling
in
the
land
that
I
gave
to
you
and
your
forefathers
But
you
did
not
incline
your
ear
or
listen
to
me
16
The
descendants
of
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
have
carried
out
the
order
that
their
forefather
gave
them
but
these
people
have
not
listened
to
me
17
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
am
bringing
on
Judah
and
on
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
all
the
calamity
that
I
have
warned
them
about
for
I
have
spoken
to
them
but
they
would
not
listen
and
I
kept
calling
to
them
but
they
would
not
answer
18
And
Jeremiah
said
to
the
household
of
the
Rechabites
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Because
you
have
obeyed
the
order
of
your
forefather
Jehonadab
and
you
continue
to
observe
all
his
orders
doing
exactly
what
he
ordered
you
19
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
There
will
never
fail
to
be
a
descendant
of
Jehonadab
the
son
of
Rechab
to
serve
in
my
presence
1
Now
in
the
fourth
year
of
Jehoiakim
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
this
word
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
saying
2
Take
a
scroll
and
write
in
it
all
the
words
that
I
have
spoken
to
you
against
Israel
and
Judah
and
all
the
nations
from
the
first
day
I
spoke
to
you
in
the
days
of
Josiah
to
this
day
3
Perhaps
when
those
of
the
house
of
Judah
hear
of
all
the
calamity
that
I
intend
to
bring
on
them
they
may
turn
back
from
their
evil
ways
so
that
I
may
forgive
their
error
and
their
sin
4
Jeremiah
then
called
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
and
Jeremiah
dictated
all
the
words
that
Jehovah
had
spoken
to
him
and
Baruch
wrote
them
in
the
scroll
5
Then
Jeremiah
commanded
Baruch
I
am
confined
and
unable
to
enter
the
house
of
Jehovah
6
So
you
are
the
one
who
must
go
in
and
read
aloud
the
words
of
Jehovah
from
the
scroll
that
you
wrote
at
my
dictation
Read
them
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
on
the
day
of
a
fast
thus
you
will
read
them
to
all
the
people
of
Judah
who
come
in
from
their
cities
7
Perhaps
their
request
for
favor
will
reach
Jehovah
and
they
will
turn
back
each
one
from
his
evil
ways
for
great
is
the
anger
and
the
wrath
that
Jehovah
has
declared
against
this
people
8
So
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
did
all
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
had
commanded
him
he
read
aloud
from
the
scroll
the
words
of
Jehovah
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
9
Now
in
the
fifth
year
of
Jehoiakim
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
in
the
ninth
month
all
the
people
in
Jerusalem
and
all
the
people
who
came
into
Jerusalem
from
the
cities
of
Judah
proclaimed
a
fast
before
Jehovah
10
Baruch
then
read
aloud
from
the
scroll
the
words
of
Jeremiah
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
the
chamber
of
Gemariah
the
son
of
Shaphan
the
copyist
in
the
upper
courtyard
at
the
entrance
of
the
new
gate
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
in
the
hearing
of
all
the
people
11
When
Micaiah
the
son
of
Gemariah
the
son
of
Shaphan
heard
all
the
words
of
Jehovah
from
the
scroll
12
he
went
down
to
the
house
of
the
king
to
the
secretarys
chamber
All
the
princes
were
sitting
there
Elishama
the
secretary
Delaiah
the
son
of
Shemaiah
Elnathan
the
son
of
Achbor
Gemariah
the
son
of
Shaphan
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Hananiah
and
all
the
other
princes
13
Micaiah
told
them
all
the
words
that
he
had
heard
when
Baruch
read
from
the
scroll
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
14
Then
all
the
princes
sent
Jehudi
the
son
of
Nethaniah
the
son
of
Shelemiah
the
son
of
Cushi
to
Baruch
saying
Come
and
bring
with
you
the
scroll
from
which
you
read
in
the
hearing
of
the
people
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
took
the
scroll
in
his
hand
and
went
in
to
them
15
They
said
to
him
Sit
down
please
and
read
it
aloud
to
us
So
Baruch
read
it
to
them
16
Now
as
soon
as
they
heard
all
the
words
they
looked
at
one
another
in
dread
and
they
said
to
Baruch
We
must
certainly
tell
the
king
all
these
words
17
And
they
asked
Baruch
Tell
us
please
how
you
wrote
all
these
words
Was
it
at
his
dictation
18
Baruch
replied
to
them
He
dictated
all
these
words
to
me
and
I
wrote
them
down
with
ink
in
this
scroll
19
The
princes
said
to
Baruch
Go
and
hide
yourselves
you
and
Jeremiah
and
do
not
let
anyone
know
where
you
are
20
Then
they
went
in
to
the
king
to
the
courtyard
and
deposited
the
scroll
in
the
chamber
of
Elishama
the
secretary
and
they
told
the
king
everything
they
had
heard
21
So
the
king
sent
Jehudi
out
to
get
the
scroll
and
he
brought
it
from
the
chamber
of
Elishama
the
secretary
Jehudi
began
to
read
it
in
the
hearing
of
the
king
and
of
all
the
princes
standing
by
the
king
22
The
king
was
sitting
in
the
winter
house
in
the
ninth
month
with
a
fire
burning
in
the
brazier
before
him
23
After
Jehudi
had
read
three
or
four
columns
the
king
would
cut
off
that
portion
with
the
secretarys
knife
and
pitch
it
into
the
fire
that
was
burning
in
the
brazier
until
the
entire
scroll
ended
up
in
the
fire
that
was
in
the
brazier
24
And
they
felt
no
dread
neither
the
king
nor
all
his
servants
who
heard
all
these
words
ripped
their
garments
apart
25
Although
Elnathan
Delaiah
and
Gemariah
pleaded
with
the
king
not
to
burn
the
scroll
he
did
not
listen
to
them
26
Further
the
king
commanded
Jerahmeel
the
son
of
the
king
Seraiah
the
son
of
Azriel
and
Shelemiah
the
son
of
Abdeel
to
seize
Baruch
the
secretary
and
Jeremiah
the
prophet
but
Jehovah
kept
them
concealed
27
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
Jeremiah
after
the
king
had
burned
up
the
scroll
containing
the
words
that
Baruch
had
written
at
Jeremiahs
dictation
saying
28
Take
another
scroll
and
write
on
it
all
the
same
words
that
were
on
the
first
scroll
which
King
Jehoiakim
of
Judah
burned
up
29
And
you
should
say
against
King
Jehoiakim
of
Judah
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
You
have
burned
up
this
scroll
and
said
Why
have
you
written
on
it
The
king
of
Babylon
will
certainly
come
and
destroy
this
land
and
empty
it
of
man
and
beast
30
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
against
King
Jehoiakim
of
Judah
He
will
have
no
one
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
David
and
his
dead
body
will
be
left
exposed
to
the
heat
by
day
and
the
frost
by
night
31
I
will
call
him
and
his
descendants
and
his
servants
to
account
for
their
error
and
I
will
bring
on
them
and
on
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
and
on
the
men
of
Judah
all
the
calamity
that
I
have
spoken
against
them
but
they
did
not
listen
32
Jeremiah
then
took
another
scroll
and
gave
it
to
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
the
secretary
and
at
Jeremiahs
dictation
he
wrote
on
it
all
the
words
of
the
scroll
that
King
Jehoiakim
of
Judah
had
burned
in
the
fire
And
many
more
words
like
those
were
added
1
And
King
Zedekiah
the
son
of
Josiah
began
to
reign
in
place
of
Coniah
the
son
of
Jehoiakim
for
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
made
him
king
in
the
land
of
Judah
2
But
he
and
his
servants
and
the
people
of
the
land
did
not
listen
to
the
words
of
Jehovah
spoken
through
Jeremiah
the
prophet
3
And
King
Zedekiah
sent
Jehucal
the
son
of
Shelemiah
and
Zephaniah
the
son
of
Maaseiah
the
priest
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
Please
pray
in
our
behalf
to
Jehovah
our
God
4
Jeremiah
was
moving
about
freely
among
the
people
for
they
had
not
yet
put
him
in
prison
5
Now
Pharaohs
army
had
set
out
from
Egypt
and
the
Chaldeans
who
were
besieging
Jerusalem
heard
the
report
about
them
So
they
withdrew
from
against
Jerusalem
6
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying
7
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
the
king
of
Judah
who
sent
you
to
me
to
inquire
of
me
Look
The
army
of
Pharaoh
that
is
coming
to
assist
you
will
have
to
go
back
to
their
land
Egypt
8
And
the
Chaldeans
will
come
back
and
fight
against
this
city
and
capture
it
and
burn
it
with
fire
9
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Do
not
deceive
yourselves
by
saying
The
Chaldeans
will
surely
go
away
from
against
us

because
they
will
not
go
away
10
Even
if
you
were
to
strike
down
the
entire
army
of
the
Chaldeans
who
are
fighting
against
you
and
only
their
wounded
men
were
left
they
would
still
rise
up
from
their
tents
and
burn
this
city
with
fire
11
When
the
Chaldean
army
had
withdrawn
from
against
Jerusalem
because
of
Pharaohs
army
12
Jeremiah
set
out
from
Jerusalem
to
the
land
of
Benjamin
to
receive
his
portion
there
among
his
people
13
But
when
he
reached
the
Gate
of
Benjamin
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
guard
whose
name
was
Irijah
the
son
of
Shelemiah
the
son
of
Hananiah
seized
Jeremiah
the
prophet
and
said
You
are
deserting
to
the
Chaldeans
14
But
Jeremiah
said
It
is
not
true
I
am
not
deserting
to
the
Chaldeans
But
he
did
not
listen
to
him
So
Irijah
arrested
Jeremiah
and
brought
him
in
to
the
princes
15
The
princes
were
furious
with
Jeremiah
and
they
beat
him
and
imprisoned
him
in
the
house
of
Jehonathan
the
secretary
which
had
been
made
into
a
prison
16
Jeremiah
was
put
into
the
dungeon
into
the
vaulted
rooms
and
he
remained
there
many
days
17
Then
King
Zedekiah
sent
for
him
and
the
king
secretly
questioned
him
in
his
house
He
asked
Is
there
any
word
from
Jehovah
Jeremiah
said
There
is
and
he
continued
You
will
be
given
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
18
Jeremiah
also
said
to
King
Zedekiah
How
have
I
sinned
against
you
and
against
your
servants
and
against
this
people
so
that
you
have
put
me
into
the
prison
19
Where
now
are
your
prophets
who
prophesied
to
you
The
king
of
Babylon
will
not
come
against
you
and
against
this
land
20
Now
listen
please
O
my
lord
the
king
May
you
grant
please
my
request
for
favor
Do
not
send
me
back
to
the
house
of
Jehonathan
the
secretary
or
I
will
die
there
21
So
King
Zedekiah
ordered
that
Jeremiah
be
put
in
custody
in
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
and
he
was
given
a
round
loaf
of
bread
daily
from
the
street
of
the
bakers
until
all
the
bread
in
the
city
was
gone
And
Jeremiah
remained
in
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
1
Now
Shephatiah
the
son
of
Mattan
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Pashhur
Jucal
the
son
of
Shelemiah
and
Pashhur
the
son
of
Malchijah
heard
the
words
that
Jeremiah
was
speaking
to
all
the
people
saying
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
The
one
who
remains
in
this
city
will
die
by
the
sword
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
But
the
one
who
surrenders
to
the
Chaldeans
will
keep
living
and
will
have
his
life
as
a
spoil
and
live
3
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
This
city
will
surely
be
handed
over
to
the
army
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
he
will
capture
it
4
The
princes
said
to
the
king
Please
have
this
man
put
to
death
for
this
is
how
he
is
weakening
the
morale
of
the
soldiers
who
are
left
in
this
city
as
well
as
that
of
all
the
people
by
speaking
such
words
to
them
For
this
man
seeks
not
the
peace
of
this
people
but
their
calamity
5
King
Zedekiah
replied
Look
He
is
in
your
hands
for
the
king
cannot
do
anything
to
stop
you
6
So
they
took
Jeremiah
and
threw
him
into
the
cistern
of
Malchijah
the
son
of
the
king
which
was
in
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
They
let
Jeremiah
down
by
ropes
Now
there
was
no
water
in
the
cistern
only
mud
and
Jeremiah
began
to
sink
down
into
the
mud
7
Ebed-melech
the
Ethiopian
a
eunuch
in
the
kings
house
heard
that
they
had
put
Jeremiah
into
the
cistern
Now
the
king
was
sitting
in
the
Gate
of
Benjamin
8
so
Ebed-melech
went
out
of
the
kings
house
and
spoke
to
the
king
saying
9
O
my
lord
the
king
what
these
men
have
done
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
is
evil
They
have
thrown
him
into
the
cistern
and
he
will
die
there
because
of
the
famine
for
there
is
no
bread
left
in
the
city
10
Then
the
king
commanded
Ebed-melech
the
Ethiopian
Take
30
men
with
you
from
here
and
pull
Jeremiah
the
prophet
up
out
of
the
cistern
before
he
dies
11
So
Ebed-melech
took
the
men
with
him
and
went
into
the
kings
house
to
a
place
beneath
the
treasury
and
they
took
from
there
some
worn-out
rags
and
worn-out
pieces
of
cloth
and
let
them
down
by
ropes
to
Jeremiah
in
the
cistern
12
Then
Ebed-melech
the
Ethiopian
said
to
Jeremiah
Please
put
the
rags
and
the
pieces
of
cloth
between
your
armpits
and
the
ropes
Jeremiah
did
so
13
and
they
drew
Jeremiah
out
with
the
ropes
and
pulled
him
up
out
of
the
cistern
And
Jeremiah
remained
in
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
14
King
Zedekiah
sent
for
Jeremiah
the
prophet
to
come
to
him
at
the
third
entrance
which
is
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
king
said
to
Jeremiah
I
have
something
to
ask
of
you
Do
not
hide
anything
from
me
15
Jeremiah
then
said
to
Zedekiah
If
I
tell
you
you
will
certainly
put
me
to
death
And
if
I
give
you
advice
you
will
not
listen
to
me
16
So
King
Zedekiah
secretly
swore
to
Jeremiah
saying
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
who
has
given
us
this
life
I
will
not
put
you
to
death
and
I
will
not
hand
you
over
to
these
men
who
are
seeking
to
take
your
life
17
Jeremiah
then
said
to
Zedekiah
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
If
you
surrender
to
the
princes
of
the
king
of
Babylon
your
life
will
be
spared
and
this
city
will
not
be
burned
with
fire
and
you
and
your
household
will
be
spared
18
But
if
you
will
not
surrender
to
the
princes
of
the
king
of
Babylon
this
city
will
be
handed
over
to
the
Chaldeans
and
they
will
burn
it
with
fire
and
you
will
not
escape
out
of
their
hand
19
Then
King
Zedekiah
said
to
Jeremiah
I
am
afraid
of
the
Jews
who
have
deserted
to
the
Chaldeans
for
if
I
am
handed
over
to
them
they
may
deal
cruelly
with
me
20
But
Jeremiah
said
You
will
not
be
handed
over
to
them
Obey
please
the
voice
of
Jehovah
in
what
I
am
telling
you
and
it
will
go
well
with
you
and
you
will
continue
to
live
21
But
if
you
refuse
to
surrender
this
is
what
Jehovah
has
revealed
to
me
22
Look
All
the
women
remaining
in
the
house
of
the
king
of
Judah
are
being
brought
out
to
the
princes
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
they
are
saying
The
men
whom
you
trusted
have
deceived
you
and
overcome
you
They
have
caused
your
foot
to
sink
into
the
mud
Now
they
have
turned
away
in
retreat
23
And
all
your
wives
and
your
sons
they
are
bringing
out
to
the
Chaldeans
and
you
will
not
escape
out
of
their
hand
but
you
will
be
seized
by
the
king
of
Babylon
and
because
of
you
this
city
will
be
burned
with
fire
24
Zedekiah
then
said
to
Jeremiah
Do
not
let
anyone
know
about
these
things
so
that
you
do
not
die
25
And
if
the
princes
hear
that
I
have
spoken
with
you
and
they
come
and
say
to
you
Tell
us
please
what
you
said
to
the
king
Do
not
hide
anything
from
us
and
we
will
not
put
you
to
death
What
did
the
king
say
to
you
26
you
must
answer
them
I
was
making
a
request
of
the
king
that
he
not
send
me
back
to
the
house
of
Jehonathan
to
die
there
27
In
time
all
the
princes
came
in
to
Jeremiah
and
questioned
him
He
told
them
everything
that
the
king
had
commanded
him
to
say
So
they
said
no
more
to
him
for
no
one
had
heard
the
conversation
28
Until
the
day
that
Jerusalem
was
captured
Jeremiah
remained
in
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
he
was
still
there
when
Jerusalem
was
captured
1
In
the
ninth
year
of
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
in
the
tenth
month
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
and
all
his
army
came
to
Jerusalem
and
they
besieged
it
2
In
the
11th
year
of
Zedekiah
in
the
fourth
month
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
they
broke
through
the
city
wall
3
And
all
the
princes
of
the
king
of
Babylon
went
in
and
sat
down
in
the
Middle
Gate
namely
Nergal-sharezer
the
Samgar
Nebo-Sarsechim
the
Rabsaris
Nergal-sharezer
the
Rabmag
and
all
the
rest
of
the
princes
of
the
king
of
Babylon
4
When
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
and
all
the
soldiers
saw
them
they
fled
going
out
of
the
city
by
night
by
way
of
the
kings
garden
through
the
gate
between
the
double
wall
and
they
continued
by
the
way
of
the
Arabah
5
But
the
Chaldean
army
chased
after
them
and
they
overtook
Zedekiah
in
the
desert
plains
of
Jericho
They
captured
him
and
brought
him
up
to
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
at
Riblah
in
the
land
of
Hamath
where
he
passed
sentence
on
him
6
The
king
of
Babylon
had
the
sons
of
Zedekiah
slaughtered
before
his
eyes
there
at
Riblah
and
the
king
of
Babylon
had
all
the
nobles
of
Judah
slaughtered
7
Then
he
blinded
the
eyes
of
Zedekiah
after
which
he
bound
him
with
copper
fetters
to
bring
him
to
Babylon
8
The
Chaldeans
then
burned
down
the
kings
house
and
the
houses
of
the
people
and
they
tore
down
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
9
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
took
into
exile
to
Babylon
the
rest
of
the
people
who
were
left
in
the
city
the
deserters
who
had
defected
to
him
and
anyone
who
remained
10
But
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
left
in
the
land
of
Judah
some
of
the
poorest
people
those
who
had
nothing
at
all
On
that
day
he
also
gave
them
vineyards
and
fields
to
work
11
Now
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
gave
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
these
orders
concerning
Jeremiah
12
Take
him
and
look
after
him
do
him
no
harm
and
grant
whatever
he
asks
of
you
13
So
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
Nebushazban
the
Rabsaris
Nergal-sharezer
the
Rabmag
and
all
the
principal
men
of
the
king
of
Babylon
sent
14
and
had
Jeremiah
taken
out
of
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
and
handed
him
over
to
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
to
be
brought
to
his
house
So
he
lived
among
the
people
15
While
Jeremiah
was
confined
in
the
Courtyard
of
the
Guard
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
him
saying
16
Go
and
tell
Ebed-melech
the
Ethiopian
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
am
fulfilling
my
words
on
this
city
for
calamity
and
not
for
good
and
in
that
day
you
will
see
it
happen
17
But
I
will
rescue
you
in
that
day

declares
Jehovah
and
you
will
not
be
handed
over
to
the
men
you
fear
18
For
I
will
surely
provide
you
with
escape
and
you
will
not
fall
by
the
sword
You
will
have
your
life
as
a
spoil
because
you
trusted
in
me

declares
Jehovah
1
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
from
Jehovah
after
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
let
him
go
free
from
Ramah
He
had
taken
him
there
bound
with
handcuffs
and
he
was
among
all
the
exiles
of
Jerusalem
and
of
Judah
who
were
being
deported
to
Babylon
2
Then
the
chief
of
the
guard
took
Jeremiah
and
said
to
him
Jehovah
your
God
foretold
this
calamity
against
this
place
3
and
Jehovah
has
brought
it
about
just
as
he
said
because
you
people
sinned
against
Jehovah
and
did
not
obey
his
voice
That
is
why
this
has
happened
to
you
4
Now
I
am
releasing
you
today
from
the
handcuffs
that
were
on
your
hands
If
it
seems
good
to
you
to
come
with
me
to
Babylon
come
and
I
will
look
after
you
But
if
you
do
not
want
to
come
with
me
to
Babylon
do
not
come
See
The
entire
land
is
before
you
Go
wherever
you
choose
5
While
Jeremiah
still
had
not
turned
back
Nebuzaradan
said
Return
to
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
whom
the
king
of
Babylon
has
appointed
over
the
cities
of
Judah
and
stay
with
him
among
the
people
or
go
wherever
you
choose
The
chief
of
the
guard
then
gave
him
a
food
allowance
and
a
gift
and
let
him
go
6
So
Jeremiah
went
to
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
at
Mizpah
and
stayed
with
him
among
the
people
who
were
left
in
the
land
7
In
time
all
the
army
chiefs
who
were
in
the
field
with
their
men
heard
that
the
king
of
Babylon
had
appointed
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
over
the
land
and
that
he
had
appointed
him
over
the
men
women
and
children
from
the
poor
people
of
the
land
who
had
not
been
deported
to
Babylon
8
So
they
came
to
Gedaliah
at
Mizpah
They
were
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
Johanan
and
Jonathan
the
sons
of
Kareah
Seraiah
the
son
of
Tanhumeth
the
sons
of
Ephai
the
Netophathite
and
Jezaniah
the
son
of
the
Maacathite
together
with
their
men
9
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
swore
an
oath
to
them
and
to
their
men
saying
Do
not
be
afraid
of
serving
the
Chaldeans
Live
in
the
land
and
serve
the
king
of
Babylon
and
it
will
go
well
with
you
10
As
for
me
I
will
stay
in
Mizpah
to
represent
you
to
the
Chaldeans
who
come
to
us
But
you
should
gather
wine
summer
fruits
and
oil
and
put
them
in
your
storage
containers
and
settle
in
the
cities
that
you
have
taken
over
11
And
all
the
Jews
who
were
in
Moab
Ammon
and
Edom
as
well
as
those
who
were
in
all
the
other
lands
also
heard
that
the
king
of
Babylon
had
let
a
remnant
stay
in
Judah
and
that
he
had
appointed
over
them
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
12
So
all
the
Jews
began
returning
from
all
the
places
to
which
they
had
been
dispersed
and
they
came
into
the
land
of
Judah
to
Gedaliah
at
Mizpah
And
they
gathered
wine
and
summer
fruits
in
very
great
quantity
13
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
and
all
the
army
chiefs
who
were
in
the
field
came
to
Gedaliah
at
Mizpah
14
They
said
to
him
Do
you
not
know
that
Baalis
the
king
of
the
Ammonites
has
sent
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
to
kill
you
But
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
did
not
believe
them
15
Then
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
secretly
told
Gedaliah
in
Mizpah
I
want
to
go
and
strike
down
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
and
no
one
will
know
Why
should
he
kill
you
and
why
should
all
the
people
of
Judah
who
have
gathered
to
you
be
scattered
and
the
remnant
of
Judah
perish
16
But
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
said
to
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
Do
not
do
this
for
what
you
are
saying
concerning
Ishmael
is
a
lie
1
In
the
seventh
month
Ishmael
son
of
Nethaniah
son
of
Elishama
who
was
of
the
royal
line
and
one
of
the
principal
men
of
the
king
came
with
ten
other
men
to
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
at
Mizpah
As
they
were
eating
a
meal
together
in
Mizpah
2
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
and
the
ten
men
who
were
with
him
rose
up
and
struck
down
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
with
the
sword
So
he
put
to
death
the
one
whom
the
king
of
Babylon
had
appointed
over
the
land
3
Ishmael
also
struck
down
all
the
Jews
who
were
with
Gedaliah
in
Mizpah
as
well
as
the
Chaldean
soldiers
who
were
there
4
On
the
second
day
after
Gedaliah
had
been
put
to
death
before
anyone
knew
about
it
5
there
came
80
men
from
Shechem
from
Shiloh
and
from
Samaria
Their
beards
were
shaved
off
their
garments
were
ripped
apart
they
had
cut
themselves
and
they
had
grain
offerings
and
frankincense
in
their
hand
to
bring
to
the
house
of
Jehovah
6
So
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
went
out
from
Mizpah
to
meet
them
weeping
as
he
walked
along
When
he
encountered
them
he
said
to
them
Come
to
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
7
But
when
they
came
into
the
city
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
and
his
men
slaughtered
them
and
threw
them
into
the
cistern
8
But
there
were
ten
men
among
them
who
said
to
Ishmael
Do
not
put
us
to
death
for
we
have
hidden
stores
of
wheat
barley
oil
and
honey
in
the
field
So
he
refrained
from
putting
them
to
death
along
with
their
brothers
9
Now
Ishmael
threw
all
the
carcasses
of
the
men
he
had
killed
into
a
great
cistern
the
one
that
King
Asa
had
made
because
of
King
Baasha
of
Israel
This
was
the
cistern
that
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
filled
with
the
slain
men
10
Ishmael
took
captive
all
the
rest
of
the
people
in
Mizpah
including
the
daughters
of
the
king
and
all
the
people
left
in
Mizpah
whom
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
had
put
in
the
custody
of
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
took
them
captive
and
went
off
to
cross
over
to
the
Ammonites
11
When
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
and
all
the
army
chiefs
who
were
with
him
heard
about
all
the
evil
that
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
had
done
12
they
took
all
the
men
and
went
off
to
fight
against
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
and
they
found
him
by
the
great
waters
in
Gibeon
13
All
the
people
who
were
with
Ishmael
rejoiced
when
they
saw
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
and
all
the
army
chiefs
with
him
14
Then
all
the
people
whom
Ishmael
had
taken
captive
from
Mizpah
turned
around
and
went
back
with
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
15
But
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
and
eight
of
his
men
escaped
from
Johanan
and
went
to
the
Ammonites
16
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
and
all
the
army
chiefs
who
were
with
him
took
with
them
the
rest
of
the
people
from
Mizpah
those
whom
they
had
rescued
from
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
after
he
had
struck
down
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
They
brought
the
men
the
soldiers
the
women
the
children
and
the
court
officials
back
from
Gibeon
17
So
they
went
and
stayed
in
the
lodging
place
of
Chimham
next
to
Bethlehem
intending
to
go
on
into
Egypt
18
because
of
the
Chaldeans
For
they
had
become
afraid
of
them
since
Ishmael
the
son
of
Nethaniah
had
struck
down
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
whom
the
king
of
Babylon
had
appointed
over
the
land
1
Then
all
the
army
chiefs
and
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
Jezaniah
the
son
of
Hoshaiah
and
all
the
people
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
approached
2
and
said
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
Hear
please
our
request
for
favor
and
pray
in
our
behalf
to
Jehovah
your
God
in
behalf
of
all
this
remnant
for
just
a
few
of
many
are
left
as
you
can
see
3
May
Jehovah
your
God
tell
us
the
way
we
should
walk
and
what
we
should
do
4
Jeremiah
the
prophet
replied
to
them
I
have
heard
you
and
I
am
praying
to
Jehovah
your
God
according
to
your
request
and
every
word
that
Jehovah
answers
you
I
will
tell
you
I
will
not
hold
back
a
word
from
you
5
They
replied
to
Jeremiah
May
Jehovah
be
a
true
and
faithful
witness
against
us
if
we
do
not
do
exactly
as
Jehovah
your
God
instructs
us
through
you
6
Whether
good
or
bad
we
will
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
our
God
to
whom
we
are
sending
you
so
that
it
may
go
well
with
us
because
we
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
our
God
7
Now
ten
days
later
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jeremiah
8
So
he
called
for
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
and
for
all
the
army
chiefs
who
were
with
him
and
for
all
the
people
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
9
He
said
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
to
whom
you
sent
me
to
present
your
request
for
favor
before
him
10
If
you
will
indeed
remain
in
this
land
then
I
will
build
you
up
and
not
tear
you
down
and
I
will
plant
you
and
not
uproot
you
for
I
will
feel
regret
over
the
calamity
I
have
caused
you
11
Do
not
be
afraid
because
of
the
king
of
Babylon
whom
you
fear
Do
not
be
afraid
because
of
him

declares
Jehovah
for
I
am
with
you
to
save
you
and
to
rescue
you
out
of
his
hand
12
And
I
will
show
you
mercy
and
he
will
have
mercy
on
you
and
return
you
to
your
own
land
13
But
if
you
say
No
we
will
not
remain
in
this
land
and
you
disobey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
14
by
saying
No
we
will
go
instead
to
the
land
of
Egypt
where
we
will
not
see
war
or
hear
the
sound
of
the
horn
or
hunger
for
bread
there
is
where
we
will
live

15
then
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
O
remnant
of
Judah
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
If
you
are
absolutely
determined
to
go
to
Egypt
and
you
go
there
to
reside
16
then
the
very
sword
you
are
afraid
of
will
catch
up
with
you
there
in
the
land
of
Egypt
and
the
very
famine
you
fear
will
follow
after
you
to
Egypt
and
there
you
will
die
17
And
all
the
men
who
are
determined
to
go
to
Egypt
to
reside
there
will
die
by
the
sword
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
None
of
them
will
survive
or
escape
the
calamity
that
I
will
bring
on
them
18
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Just
as
my
anger
and
my
wrath
were
poured
out
on
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
so
my
wrath
will
be
poured
out
on
you
if
you
go
to
Egypt
and
you
will
become
a
curse
an
object
of
horror
a
malediction
and
a
reproach
and
you
will
never
again
see
this
place
19
Jehovah
has
spoken
against
you
O
remnant
of
Judah
Do
not
go
to
Egypt
You
should
know
for
a
certainty
that
I
have
warned
you
today
20
that
your
error
will
cost
you
your
lives
For
you
sent
me
to
Jehovah
your
God
saying
Pray
in
our
behalf
to
Jehovah
our
God
and
tell
us
everything
that
Jehovah
our
God
says
and
we
will
do
it
21
And
I
told
you
today
but
you
will
not
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
or
do
anything
he
sent
me
to
tell
you
22
Therefore
know
for
a
certainty
that
by
the
sword
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
you
will
die
in
the
place
where
you
desire
to
go
and
reside
1
When
Jeremiah
had
finished
speaking
to
all
the
people
all
these
words
from
Jehovah
their
God
every
single
word
that
Jehovah
their
God
had
sent
him
to
tell
them
2
Azariah
the
son
of
Hoshaiah
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
and
all
the
presumptuous
men
said
to
Jeremiah
What
you
are
saying
is
a
lie
Jehovah
our
God
has
not
sent
you
to
say
Do
not
go
to
Egypt
to
reside
there
3
But
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
is
inciting
you
against
us
to
hand
us
over
to
the
Chaldeans
to
put
us
to
death
or
to
take
us
into
exile
in
Babylon
4
So
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
and
all
the
army
chiefs
and
all
the
people
disobeyed
the
voice
of
Jehovah
to
remain
in
the
land
of
Judah
5
Instead
Johanan
the
son
of
Kareah
and
all
the
army
chiefs
took
with
them
all
the
remnant
of
Judah
who
had
returned
to
reside
in
the
land
of
Judah
from
all
the
nations
where
they
had
been
dispersed
6
They
took
the
men
the
women
the
children
the
daughters
of
the
king
and
everyone
whom
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
had
left
with
Gedaliah
the
son
of
Ahikam
the
son
of
Shaphan
as
well
as
Jeremiah
the
prophet
and
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
7
And
they
went
into
the
land
of
Egypt
for
they
did
not
obey
the
voice
of
Jehovah
and
they
went
as
far
as
Tahpanhes
8
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jeremiah
in
Tahpanhes
saying
9
Take
in
your
hand
large
stones
and
hide
them
in
the
mortar
in
the
brick
terrace
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
of
Pharaoh
in
Tahpanhes
with
the
Jewish
men
looking
on
10
Then
say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
am
sending
for
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
Babylon
my
servant
and
I
will
place
his
throne
right
above
these
stones
that
I
have
hidden
and
he
will
extend
his
royal
tent
over
them
11
And
he
will
come
in
and
strike
the
land
of
Egypt
Whoever
is
meant
for
deadly
plague
will
be
for
deadly
plague
and
whoever
is
meant
for
captivity
will
be
for
captivity
and
whoever
is
meant
for
the
sword
will
be
for
the
sword
12
And
I
will
set
the
houses
of
the
gods
of
Egypt
on
fire
and
he
will
burn
them
and
lead
them
captive
He
will
wrap
the
land
of
Egypt
around
himself
just
as
a
shepherd
wraps
himself
in
his
garment
and
he
will
depart
from
there
in
peace
13
And
he
will
break
to
pieces
the
pillars
of
Beth-shemesh
in
the
land
of
Egypt
and
he
will
burn
the
houses
of
the
gods
of
Egypt
with
fire
1
The
word
that
came
to
Jeremiah
for
all
the
Jews
living
in
the
land
of
Egypt
those
living
in
Migdol
Tahpanhes
Noph
and
the
land
of
Pathros
saying
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
You
have
seen
all
the
calamity
that
I
brought
on
Jerusalem
and
on
all
the
cities
of
Judah
and
today
they
are
in
ruins
without
an
inhabitant
3
It
is
because
of
the
evil
things
that
they
did
to
offend
me
by
going
and
making
sacrifices
and
serving
other
gods
whom
they
had
not
known
neither
you
nor
your
forefathers
4
I
kept
sending
all
my
servants
the
prophets
to
you
sending
them
again
and
again
saying
Please
do
not
do
this
detestable
thing
that
I
hate
5
But
they
did
not
listen
or
incline
their
ear
to
turn
back
from
their
evil
by
not
making
sacrifices
to
other
gods
6
So
my
wrath
and
my
anger
were
poured
out
and
burned
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
and
they
became
a
ruin
and
a
wasteland
as
they
are
today
7
And
now
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Why
are
you
causing
a
great
calamity
to
yourselves
so
that
every
man
and
woman
child
and
infant
will
perish
from
Judah
leaving
you
without
a
remnant
8
Why
should
you
offend
me
with
the
works
of
your
hands
by
sacrificing
to
other
gods
in
the
land
of
Egypt
where
you
have
gone
to
reside
You
will
perish
and
become
an
object
of
cursing
and
a
reproach
among
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
9
Have
you
forgotten
the
wicked
deeds
of
your
forefathers
and
the
wicked
deeds
of
the
kings
of
Judah
and
the
wicked
deeds
of
their
wives
as
well
as
your
own
wicked
deeds
and
the
wicked
deeds
of
your
wives
that
were
done
in
the
land
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
10
Down
to
this
day
they
have
not
humbled
themselves
they
have
shown
no
fear
nor
have
they
walked
in
my
law
and
my
statutes
that
I
set
before
you
and
your
forefathers
11
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
am
determined
to
bring
calamity
on
you
to
destroy
all
Judah
12
And
I
will
take
the
remnant
of
Judah
who
were
determined
to
go
to
the
land
of
Egypt
to
reside
there
and
they
will
all
perish
in
the
land
of
Egypt
They
will
fall
by
the
sword
and
perish
by
the
famine
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
they
will
die
by
the
sword
and
by
famine
And
they
will
become
a
curse
an
object
of
horror
a
malediction
and
a
reproach
13
I
will
punish
those
dwelling
in
the
land
of
Egypt
just
as
I
punished
Jerusalem
with
the
sword
with
famine
and
with
pestilence
14
And
the
remnant
of
Judah
who
have
gone
to
reside
in
the
land
of
Egypt
will
not
escape
or
survive
to
return
to
the
land
of
Judah
They
will
long
to
return
and
dwell
there
but
they
will
not
return
except
for
a
few
escapees
15
All
the
men
who
knew
that
their
wives
had
been
making
sacrifices
to
other
gods
and
all
the
wives
who
were
standing
there
who
formed
a
large
group
and
all
the
people
who
were
living
in
the
land
of
Egypt
in
Pathros
answered
Jeremiah
16
We
will
not
listen
to
the
word
that
you
have
spoken
to
us
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
17
Instead
we
will
surely
carry
out
every
word
that
our
mouths
have
spoken
to
make
sacrifices
to
the
Queen
of
Heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
to
her
just
as
we
our
forefathers
our
kings
and
our
princes
did
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem
when
we
were
satisfied
with
bread
and
were
well-off
when
we
saw
no
calamity
at
all
18
From
the
time
we
quit
making
sacrifices
to
the
Queen
of
Heaven
and
pouring
out
drink
offerings
to
her
we
have
lacked
everything
and
have
perished
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
19
The
women
added
And
when
we
were
making
sacrifices
to
the
Queen
of
Heaven
and
pouring
out
drink
offerings
to
her
was
it
without
the
consent
of
our
husbands
that
we
made
sacrificial
cakes
shaped
in
her
image
and
we
poured
out
drink
offerings
to
her
20
Then
Jeremiah
said
to
all
the
people
to
the
men
and
their
wives
and
to
all
the
people
who
were
speaking
to
him
21
The
sacrifices
that
you
your
forefathers
your
kings
your
princes
and
the
people
of
the
land
made
in
the
cities
of
Judah
and
in
the
streets
of
Jerusalem—Jehovah
remembered
them
and
they
came
up
into
his
heart
22
Finally
Jehovah
could
no
longer
put
up
with
your
evil
practices
and
the
detestable
things
you
had
done
and
your
land
became
a
devastated
place
an
object
of
horror
and
cursing
without
an
inhabitant
as
it
is
today
23
It
is
because
you
have
made
these
sacrifices
and
because
you
have
sinned
against
Jehovah
by
not
obeying
the
voice
of
Jehovah
and
following
his
law
his
statutes
and
his
reminders
that
this
calamity
has
come
upon
you
as
is
the
case
today
24
Jeremiah
continued
to
say
to
all
the
people
and
to
all
the
women
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
all
you
of
Judah
who
are
in
the
land
of
Egypt
25
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
What
you
and
your
wives
have
spoken
with
your
mouths
you
have
fulfilled
with
your
hands
for
you
said
We
will
surely
carry
out
our
vows
to
make
sacrifices
to
the
Queen
of
Heaven
and
to
pour
out
drink
offerings
to
her
You
women
will
surely
carry
out
your
vows
and
perform
your
vows
26
Therefore
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
all
you
of
Judah
who
are
living
in
the
land
of
Egypt
Here
I
swear
by
my
own
great
name

says
Jehovah
that
my
name
will
no
longer
be
called
on
in
an
oath
by
any
man
of
Judah
in
all
the
land
of
Egypt
who
says
As
surely
as
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
is
alive
27
Now
I
am
watching
over
them
to
bring
calamity
and
not
something
good
all
the
men
of
Judah
in
the
land
of
Egypt
will
perish
by
the
sword
and
by
the
famine
until
they
cease
to
exist
28
Only
a
few
will
escape
the
sword
and
return
from
the
land
of
Egypt
to
the
land
of
Judah
Then
all
the
remnant
of
Judah
who
came
to
the
land
of
Egypt
to
reside
there
will
know
whose
word
has
come
true
mine
or
theirs
29
And
this
is
the
sign
for
you

declares
Jehovah
that
I
will
punish
you
in
this
place
so
that
you
will
know
that
my
words
promising
calamity
against
you
will
surely
come
true
30
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
giving
Pharaoh
Hophra
the
king
of
Egypt
into
the
hand
of
his
enemies
and
of
those
seeking
to
take
his
life
just
as
I
gave
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
into
the
hand
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
who
was
his
enemy
and
who
sought
to
take
his
life
1
This
is
the
word
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
spoke
to
Baruch
the
son
of
Neriah
when
he
wrote
in
a
book
these
words
dictated
by
Jeremiah
in
the
fourth
year
of
Jehoiakim
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
says
concerning
you
Baruch
3
You
have
said
Woe
to
me
for
Jehovah
has
added
grief
to
my
pain
I
am
weary
from
my
groaning
and
I
have
found
no
resting-place
4
You
should
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Look
What
I
have
built
up
I
am
tearing
down
and
what
I
have
planted
I
am
uprooting—the
entire
land
5
But
you
are
seeking
great
things
for
yourself
Stop
seeking
such
things
For
I
am
about
to
bring
a
calamity
on
all
flesh

declares
Jehovah
and
wherever
you
may
go
I
will
grant
you
your
life
as
a
spoil
1
This
is
the
word
of
Jehovah
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
concerning
the
nations
2
For
Egypt
concerning
the
army
of
Pharaoh
Necho
the
king
of
Egypt
who
was
along
the
Euphrates
River
and
was
defeated
at
Carchemish
by
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
in
the
fourth
year
of
Jehoiakim
son
of
Josiah
the
king
of
Judah

3
Prepare
your
bucklers
and
large
shields
And
advance
to
the
battle

4
Harness
the
horses
and
mount
you
horsemen
Take
your
positions
and
put
on
your
helmets
Polish
the
lances
and
put
on
your
coats
of
mail

5
Why
do
I
see
them
terror-stricken
They
are
retreating
their
warriors
are
crushed
They
have
fled
in
panic
their
warriors
have
not
turned
around
There
is
terror
all
around

declares
Jehovah

6
The
swift
cannot
flee
and
the
warriors
cannot
escape
In
the
north
by
the
bank
of
the
Euphrates
River
They
have
stumbled
and
fallen

7
Who
is
this
coming
up
like
the
Nile
River
Like
the
rivers
of
surging
waters

8
Egypt
comes
up
just
like
the
Nile
River
Like
rivers
of
surging
waters
And
it
says
I
will
go
up
and
cover
the
earth
I
will
destroy
the
city
and
those
inhabiting
it

9
Go
up
you
horses
Drive
madly
you
chariots
Let
the
warriors
advance
Cush
and
Put
who
handle
the
shield
And
the
Ludim
who
handle
and
bend
the
bow
10
That
day
belongs
to
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
the
day
of
vengeance
for
taking
revenge
on
his
adversaries
And
the
sword
will
devour
and
satisfy
itself
and
take
its
fill
of
their
blood
for
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
has
a
sacrifice
in
the
land
of
the
north
by
the
Euphrates
River
11
Go
up
to
Gilead
to
get
balsam
O
virgin
daughter
of
Egypt
In
vain
you
have
multiplied
your
remedies
For
there
is
no
cure
for
you
12
The
nations
have
heard
your
dishonor
And
your
outcry
has
filled
the
land
For
warrior
stumbles
against
warrior
And
they
both
fall
down
together
13
This
is
the
word
that
Jehovah
spoke
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
regarding
the
coming
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
to
strike
down
the
land
of
Egypt
14
Declare
it
in
Egypt
proclaim
it
in
Migdol
Proclaim
it
in
Noph
and
in
Tahpanhes
Say
Take
your
positions
and
prepare
yourselves
For
a
sword
will
devour
all
around
you
15
Why
have
your
powerful
men
been
swept
away
They
did
not
stand
their
ground
For
Jehovah
has
pushed
them
down
16
In
great
numbers
they
are
stumbling
and
falling
They
are
saying
to
one
another
Get
up
Let
us
return
to
our
people
and
our
homelandBecause
of
the
cruel
sword
17
There
they
have
proclaimed
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
is
just
a
meaningless
noiseWho
has
let
the
opportunity
pass
by
18
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
King
whose
name
is
Jehovah
of
armies
He
will
come
in
like
Tabor
among
the
mountainsAnd
like
Carmel
by
the
sea
19
Prepare
your
baggage
for
exile
O
daughter
inhabiting
Egypt
For
Noph
will
become
an
object
of
horror
It
will
be
set
afire
and
left
without
an
inhabitant
20
Egypt
is
like
a
good-looking
heifer
But
stinging
flies
will
come
against
her
from
the
north
21
Even
her
hired
soldiers
in
her
midst
are
like
fattened
calves
But
they
have
also
turned
back
and
fled
together
They
could
not
stand
their
ground
For
the
day
of
their
disaster
has
come
upon
them
Their
time
of
reckoning
22
Her
sound
is
like
that
of
a
slithering
serpent
For
they
come
after
her
in
force
with
axes
Like
men
cutting
down
trees
23
They
will
cut
down
her
forest

declares
Jehovah
though
it
seemed
impenetrable
For
they
are
more
numerous
than
locusts
without
number
24
The
daughter
of
Egypt
will
be
put
to
shame
She
will
be
handed
over
to
the
people
of
the
north
25
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Now
I
am
turning
my
attention
to
Amon
from
No
to
Pharaoh
to
Egypt
to
her
gods
and
to
her
kings—yes
to
Pharaoh
and
all
those
trusting
in
him
26
And
I
will
hand
them
over
to
those
seeking
to
take
their
life
to
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
and
his
servants
But
afterward
she
will
be
inhabited
as
in
times
past

declares
Jehovah
27
As
for
you
do
not
be
afraid
my
servant
Jacob
And
do
not
be
terrified
O
Israel
For
I
will
save
you
from
far
awayAnd
your
offspring
from
the
land
of
their
captivity
Jacob
will
return
and
be
calm
and
undisturbed
With
no
one
to
make
them
afraid
28
So
do
not
be
afraid
my
servant
Jacob

declares
Jehovah
for
I
am
with
you
I
will
make
an
extermination
among
all
the
nations
where
I
dispersed
you
But
you
I
will
not
exterminate
I
will
discipline
you
to
the
proper
degree
But
I
will
by
no
means
leave
you
unpunished
1
This
is
the
word
of
Jehovah
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
concerning
the
Philistines
before
Pharaoh
struck
down
Gaza
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Look
Waters
are
coming
from
the
north
They
will
become
a
flooding
torrent
And
they
will
flood
the
land
and
everything
in
it
The
city
and
those
inhabiting
it
The
men
will
cry
out
And
everyone
dwelling
in
the
land
will
wail

3
At
the
sound
of
the
pounding
hooves
of
his
stallions
At
the
rattling
of
his
war
chariotsAnd
the
rumbling
of
his
wheels
Fathers
will
not
even
turn
around
for
their
sons
For
their
hands
fall
limp
4
Because
the
day
that
is
coming
will
destroy
all
the
Philistines
It
will
cut
off
from
Tyre
and
Sidon
every
remaining
ally
For
Jehovah
will
destroy
the
Philistines
Who
are
the
remaining
ones
from
the
island
of
Caphtor

5
Baldness
will
come
to
Gaza
Ashkelon
has
been
silenced
O
remnant
of
their
valley
plain
How
long
will
you
keep
making
cuts
on
yourself

6
Ah
The
sword
of
Jehovah
How
long
will
you
not
be
quiet
Go
back
into
your
sheath
Take
your
rest
and
be
silent

7
How
can
it
be
quietWhen
Jehovah
has
given
it
a
command
Against
Ashkelon
and
the
seacoast
There
is
where
he
has
assigned
it
1
For
Moab
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Woe
to
Nebo
for
she
has
been
destroyed
Kiriathaim
has
been
put
to
shame
and
captured
The
secure
refuge
has
been
put
to
shame
and
shattered

2
They
no
longer
praise
Moab
In
Heshbon
they
have
plotted
her
downfall
Come
let
us
put
an
end
to
her
as
a
nation
You
too
O
Madmen
should
keep
silent
For
the
sword
is
following
you

3
There
is
the
sound
of
an
outcry
from
Horonaim
Of
destruction
and
great
collapse

4
Moab
has
been
broken
down
Her
little
ones
cry
out

5
On
the
ascent
of
Luhith
they
weep
continually
as
they
climb
And
on
the
way
down
from
Horonaim
they
hear
cries
of
distress
over
the
catastrophe

6
Flee
escape
for
your
lives
You
must
become
like
a
juniper
tree
in
the
wilderness

7
Because
you
trust
in
your
works
and
in
your
treasures
You
will
also
be
captured
And
Chemosh
will
go
into
exile
Together
with
his
priests
and
his
princes

8
The
destroyer
will
come
in
on
every
city
And
no
city
will
escape
The
valley
will
perish
And
the
level
land
will
be
annihilated
just
as
Jehovah
has
said

9
Set
up
a
marker
for
Moab
For
as
she
falls
into
ruins
she
will
flee
And
her
cities
will
become
an
object
of
horror
Without
an
inhabitant
10
Cursed
is
the
one
who
carries
out
the
mission
of
Jehovah
neglectfully
Cursed
is
the
one
who
holds
back
his
sword
from
bloodshed
11
The
Moabites
have
been
undisturbed
since
their
youth
Like
wine
that
has
settled
on
the
dregs
They
have
not
been
poured
from
one
vessel
into
another
And
they
have
never
gone
into
exile
That
is
why
their
taste
has
remained
the
same
And
their
aroma
has
not
changed
12
Therefore
look
the
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
when
I
will
send
men
to
overturn
them
They
will
turn
them
over
and
empty
out
their
vessels
and
they
will
smash
their
large
jars
to
pieces
13
And
the
Moabites
will
be
ashamed
of
Chemosh
just
as
the
house
of
Israel
is
ashamed
of
Bethel
which
was
their
confidence
14
How
dare
you
say
We
are
mighty
warriors
ready
for
battle
15
Moab
has
been
destroyed
Her
cities
have
been
invaded
And
their
choicest
young
men
have
been
slaughtered

Declares
the
King
whose
name
is
Jehovah
of
armies
16
The
disaster
on
the
Moabites
is
coming
soon
And
their
downfall
is
approaching
quickly
17
All
those
around
them
will
have
to
sympathize
with
them
All
those
knowing
their
name
Tell
them
O
how
the
mighty
rod
has
been
broken
the
staff
of
beauty
18
Come
down
from
your
glory
And
sit
down
in
thirst
O
daughter
inhabiting
Dibon
For
the
destroyer
of
Moab
has
come
against
you
And
he
will
bring
your
fortified
places
to
ruin
19
Stand
by
the
road
and
watch
inhabitant
of
Aroer
Ask
the
man
fleeing
and
the
woman
escaping
What
has
happened
20
Moab
has
been
put
to
shame
and
struck
with
terror
Wail
and
cry
out
Proclaim
in
Arnon
that
Moab
has
been
destroyed
21
Judgment
has
come
to
the
level
land
against
Holon
Jahaz
and
Mephaath
22
against
Dibon
Nebo
and
Beth-diblathaim
23
against
Kiriathaim
Beth-gamul
and
Beth-meon
24
against
Kerioth
and
Bozrah
and
against
all
the
cities
of
the
land
of
Moab
those
far
and
near
25
The
strength
of
Moab
has
been
cut
down
His
arm
has
been
broken

declares
Jehovah
26
Make
him
drunk
for
he
has
exalted
himself
against
Jehovah
Moab
wallows
in
his
vomit
And
he
is
an
object
of
ridicule
27
Was
Israel
not
an
object
of
ridicule
to
you
Was
he
found
among
thieves
So
that
you
should
shake
your
head
and
speak
against
him
28
Leave
the
cities
and
live
on
the
crag
inhabitants
of
Moab
And
become
like
a
dove
that
nests
along
the
sides
of
the
gorge
29
We
have
heard
about
the
pride
of
Moab—he
is
very
haughty—About
his
arrogance
his
pride
his
haughtiness
and
the
loftiness
of
his
heart
30
I
know
his
fury

declares
Jehovah
But
his
empty
talk
will
come
to
nothing
They
will
do
nothing
31
That
is
why
I
will
wail
over
Moab
For
all
Moab
I
will
cry
outAnd
moan
for
the
men
of
Kir-heres
32
With
more
than
the
weeping
for
Jazer
I
will
weep
for
you
O
vine
of
Sibmah
Your
flourishing
shoots
have
crossed
the
sea
To
the
sea
to
Jazer
they
have
reached
Upon
your
summer
fruit
and
your
grape
harvestThe
destroyer
has
descended
33
Rejoicing
and
joyfulness
have
been
removed
from
the
orchardAnd
from
the
land
of
Moab
I
have
caused
the
wine
to
stop
flowing
from
the
winepress
No
one
will
be
treading
with
shouts
of
joy
The
shouting
will
be
different
shouting
34
There
is
an
outcry
from
Heshbon
clear
to
Elealeh
They
raise
their
voice
clear
to
Jahaz
From
Zoar
to
Horonaim
to
Eglath-shelishiyah
Even
the
waters
of
Nimrim
will
become
desolate
35
I
will
cause
to
cease
from
Moab

declares
Jehovah
The
one
bringing
an
offering
on
the
high
placeAnd
the
one
making
sacrifices
to
his
god
36
That
is
why
my
heart
will
moan
for
Moab
like
a
flute
And
my
heart
will
moan
for
the
men
of
Kir-heres
like
a
flute
For
the
wealth
he
has
produced
will
perish
37
For
every
head
is
bald
And
every
beard
is
clipped
There
are
cuts
on
every
hand
And
there
is
sackcloth
on
their
hips
38
On
all
the
roofs
of
MoabAnd
in
all
her
public
squares
There
is
nothing
but
wailing
For
I
have
broken
MoabLike
a
discarded
jar

declares
Jehovah
39
How
she
is
terrified
Wail
How
Moab
has
turned
his
back
in
shame
Moab
has
become
an
object
of
ridicule
Something
terrifying
to
all
those
around
him
40
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Look
Just
like
an
eagle
that
swoops
down
He
will
spread
his
wings
over
Moab
41
The
towns
will
be
captured
And
her
strongholds
will
be
seized
In
that
day
the
heart
of
Moabs
warriorsWill
be
like
the
heart
of
a
woman
in
childbirth
42
And
Moab
will
be
annihilated
from
being
a
people
For
it
is
against
Jehovah
that
he
has
exalted
himself
43
Terror
and
the
pit
and
the
trap
are
before
you
O
inhabitant
of
Moab

declares
Jehovah
44
Anyone
fleeing
the
terror
will
fall
into
the
pit
And
anyone
coming
up
from
the
pit
will
be
caught
in
the
trap
For
I
will
bring
on
Moab
the
year
of
their
punishment

declares
Jehovah
45
In
the
shadow
of
Heshbon
those
fleeing
stand
powerless
For
a
fire
will
come
out
of
HeshbonAnd
a
flame
from
within
Sihon
It
will
consume
the
forehead
of
MoabAnd
the
skull
of
the
sons
of
tumult
46
Woe
to
you
O
Moab
The
people
of
Chemosh
have
perished
For
your
sons
have
been
taken
captive
And
your
daughters
have
gone
into
exile
47
But
I
will
gather
the
captives
of
Moab
in
the
final
part
of
the
days

declares
Jehovah
Down
to
this
point
is
the
judgment
on
Moab
1
For
the
Ammonites
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Does
Israel
have
no
sons
Does
he
have
no
heir
Why
has
Malcam
taken
possession
of
Gad
And
why
are
his
people
living
in
Israels
cities

2
Therefore
look
the
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
When
I
will
cause
the
alarm
signal
of
war
to
be
heard
against
Rabbah
of
the
Ammonites
She
will
become
a
desolate
mound
And
her
dependent
towns
will
be
set
on
fire
And
Israel
will
take
possession
of
those
who
dispossessed
him

says
Jehovah

3
Wail
O
Heshbon
for
Ai
has
been
destroyed
Cry
out
O
dependent
towns
of
Rabbah
Put
on
sackcloth
Wail
and
rove
about
among
the
stone
pens
For
Malcam
will
go
into
exile
Together
with
his
priests
and
his
princes

4
Why
do
you
brag
about
the
valleys
About
your
flowing
plain
O
unfaithful
daughter
Who
trusts
in
her
treasuresAnd
who
says
Who
will
come
against
me

5
Here
I
am
bringing
something
dreadful
on
you

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
From
all
those
around
you
You
will
be
dispersed
in
every
direction
And
no
one
will
gather
those
who
flee

6
But
afterward
I
will
gather
the
captives
of
the
Ammonites

declares
Jehovah
7
For
Edom
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Is
there
no
longer
any
wisdom
in
Teman
Has
good
advice
perished
from
those
with
understanding
Has
their
wisdom
rotted

8
Flee
turn
back
Go
and
dwell
down
in
the
depths
O
inhabitants
of
Dedan
For
I
will
bring
disaster
on
EsauWhen
the
time
comes
to
turn
my
attention
to
him

9
If
grape
gatherers
came
in
to
you
Would
they
not
leave
some
behind
for
gleaning
If
thieves
came
in
by
night
They
would
cause
only
as
much
ruin
as
they
wanted
10
But
I
will
strip
Esau
bare
I
will
uncover
his
places
of
concealment
So
that
he
cannot
hide
His
children
and
his
brothers
and
his
neighbors
will
all
be
destroyed
And
he
will
be
no
more
11
Leave
your
fatherless
children
And
I
will
preserve
them
alive
And
your
widows
will
trust
in
me
12
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Look
If
those
not
sentenced
to
drink
the
cup
must
drink
it
should
you
be
left
completely
unpunished
You
will
not
be
left
unpunished
for
you
must
drink
it
13
For
by
myself
I
have
sworn

declares
Jehovah
that
Bozrah
will
become
an
object
of
horror
a
reproach
a
devastation
and
a
curse
and
all
her
cities
will
become
perpetual
ruins
14
I
have
heard
a
report
from
Jehovah
An
envoy
has
been
sent
among
the
nations
saying
Gather
yourselves
together
and
come
against
her
Prepare
for
battle
15
For
look
I
have
made
you
insignificant
among
the
nations
Despised
among
men
16
The
shuddering
you
caused
has
deceived
you
The
presumptuousness
of
your
heart
O
you
who
reside
in
the
retreats
of
the
crag
Occupying
the
highest
hill
Although
you
build
your
nest
high
up
like
an
eagle
I
will
bring
you
down
from
there

declares
Jehovah
17
And
Edom
must
become
an
object
of
horror
Everyone
passing
along
by
her
will
stare
in
horror
and
whistle
on
account
of
all
her
plagues
18
Just
as
in
the
overthrow
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
of
their
neighboring
towns

Jehovah
says
no
one
will
dwell
there
and
no
man
will
settle
there
19
Look
Someone
will
come
up
against
the
secure
pastures
like
a
lion
from
the
dense
thickets
along
the
Jordan
but
in
a
moment
I
will
make
him
run
away
from
her
And
I
will
appoint
over
her
the
chosen
one
For
who
is
like
me
and
who
will
challenge
me
What
shepherd
can
stand
before
me
20
Therefore
hear
O
men
the
decision
that
Jehovah
has
made
against
Edom
and
what
he
has
thought
out
against
the
inhabitants
of
Teman
Surely
the
little
ones
of
the
flock
will
be
dragged
away
He
will
make
their
dwelling
place
desolate
because
of
them
21
At
the
sound
of
their
falling
the
earth
has
quaked
There
is
an
outcry
The
sound
has
been
heard
as
far
as
the
Red
Sea
22
Look
Just
like
an
eagle
he
will
ascend
and
swoop
down
And
he
will
spread
out
his
wings
over
Bozrah
In
that
day
the
heart
of
the
warriors
of
EdomWill
become
like
the
heart
of
a
woman
in
childbirth
23
For
Damascus
Hamath
and
Arpad
have
been
put
to
shame
For
they
have
heard
a
bad
report
They
melt
in
fear
There
is
anxiety
in
the
sea
that
cannot
be
calmed
24
Damascus
has
lost
courage
She
has
turned
to
flee
but
panic
has
seized
her
Distress
and
pain
have
taken
hold
of
her
Like
a
woman
who
is
giving
birth
25
How
is
it
that
the
city
of
praise
has
not
been
abandoned
The
town
of
exultation
26
For
her
young
men
will
fall
in
her
public
squares
And
all
the
soldiers
will
perish
in
that
day

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
27
I
will
set
the
wall
of
Damascus
on
fire
And
it
will
consume
the
fortified
towers
of
Ben-hadad
28
For
Kedar
and
the
kingdoms
of
Hazor
which
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
struck
down
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Rise
up
go
up
to
Kedar
And
destroy
the
sons
of
the
East
29
Their
tents
and
their
flocks
will
be
taken
Their
tent
cloths
and
all
their
goods
Their
camels
will
be
carried
off
And
they
will
cry
out
to
them
Terror
is
all
around
30
Flee
go
far
away
Go
and
dwell
down
in
the
depths
O
inhabitants
of
Hazor

declares
Jehovah
For
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
has
devised
a
strategy
against
you
And
he
has
thought
out
a
plan
against
you
31
Rise
up
go
up
against
the
nation
that
is
at
peace
Dwelling
in
security
declares
Jehovah
It
has
no
doors
or
bars
they
live
in
isolation
32
Their
camels
will
become
plunder
And
their
abundant
livestock
a
spoil
I
will
scatter
them
to
every
wind
Those
who
clip
their
hair
at
the
temples
And
I
will
bring
their
disaster
from
every
direction

declares
Jehovah
33
And
Hazor
will
become
a
lair
of
jackals
A
perpetual
desolation
No
one
will
dwell
there
And
no
man
will
settle
in
her
34
This
is
the
word
of
Jehovah
that
came
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
concerning
Elam
in
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
35
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Here
I
am
breaking
the
bow
of
Elam
the
source
of
their
mightiness
36
I
will
bring
in
on
Elam
the
four
winds
from
the
four
extremities
of
the
heavens
and
I
will
scatter
them
to
all
these
winds
There
will
not
be
a
nation
to
which
the
dispersed
ones
of
Elam
will
not
go
37
I
will
shatter
the
Elamites
before
their
enemies
and
before
those
seeking
to
take
their
life
and
I
will
bring
calamity
on
them
my
burning
anger

declares
Jehovah
And
I
will
send
the
sword
after
them
until
I
have
exterminated
them
38
And
I
will
set
my
throne
in
Elam
and
I
will
destroy
from
there
the
king
and
the
princes

declares
Jehovah
39
But
in
the
final
part
of
the
days
I
will
gather
the
captives
of
Elam

declares
Jehovah
1
The
word
that
Jehovah
spoke
concerning
Babylon
concerning
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
through
Jeremiah
the
prophet

2
Declare
it
among
the
nations
and
proclaim
it
Raise
a
signal
and
proclaim
it
Do
not
hide
anything
Say
Babylon
has
been
captured
Bel
has
been
put
to
shame
Merodach
has
become
terrified
Her
images
have
been
put
to
shame
Her
disgusting
idols
have
become
terrified

3
For
a
nation
has
come
against
her
from
the
north
It
makes
her
land
an
object
of
horror
No
one
is
dwelling
in
her
Both
man
and
beast
have
taken
flight
They
have
gone
away
4
In
those
days
and
at
that
time

declares
Jehovah
the
people
of
Israel
and
the
people
of
Judah
will
come
together
They
will
weep
as
they
walk
and
together
they
will
seek
Jehovah
their
God
5
They
will
ask
the
way
to
Zion
with
their
faces
turned
in
that
direction
saying
Come
and
let
us
join
ourselves
to
Jehovah
in
an
everlasting
covenant
that
will
not
be
forgotten
6
My
people
have
become
a
flock
of
lost
sheep
Their
own
shepherds
caused
them
to
stray
They
led
them
away
onto
the
mountains
roaming
from
mountain
to
hill
They
have
forgotten
their
resting-place
7
All
those
finding
them
have
devoured
them
and
their
enemies
have
said
We
are
not
guilty
because
they
sinned
against
Jehovah
against
the
dwelling
place
of
righteousness
and
the
hope
of
their
forefathers
Jehovah

8
Flee
out
of
the
midst
of
Babylon
Go
out
of
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
And
be
like
the
leading
animals
before
the
flock

9
For
here
I
am
raising
up
and
bringing
against
BabylonAn
assembly
of
great
nations
from
the
land
of
the
north
They
will
come
against
her
in
battle
formation
From
there
she
will
be
captured
Their
arrows
are
like
those
of
a
warriorCausing
bereavement
of
children
They
do
not
come
back
without
results
10
Chaldea
will
become
a
spoil
All
those
taking
spoil
from
her
will
be
fully
satisfied

declares
Jehovah
11
For
you
kept
rejoicing
you
kept
exultingWhen
pillaging
my
own
inheritance
For
you
kept
pawing
like
a
heifer
in
the
grass
And
you
kept
neighing
like
stallions
12
Your
mother
has
been
put
to
shame
She
who
gave
birth
to
you
has
been
disappointed
Look
She
is
the
least
of
the
nations
A
waterless
wilderness
and
a
desert
13
Because
of
the
indignation
of
Jehovah
she
will
not
be
inhabited
She
will
become
utterly
desolate
Anyone
passing
by
Babylon
will
stare
in
horrorAnd
whistle
because
of
all
her
plagues
14
Come
against
Babylon
in
battle
formation
on
every
side
All
you
who
are
bending
the
bow
Shoot
at
her
spare
no
arrow
For
it
is
against
Jehovah
that
she
has
sinned
15
Shout
a
war
cry
against
her
on
every
side
She
has
surrendered
Her
pillars
have
fallen
her
walls
are
torn
down
For
it
is
the
vengeance
of
Jehovah
Take
your
vengeance
on
her
Do
to
her
just
as
she
has
done
16
Cut
off
the
sower
from
BabylonAnd
the
one
handling
the
sickle
in
harvesttime
Because
of
the
cruel
sword
each
will
return
to
his
own
people
Each
one
will
flee
to
his
own
land
17
The
people
of
Israel
are
scattered
sheep
Lions
have
dispersed
them
First
the
king
of
Assyria
devoured
them
then
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
gnawed
on
their
bones
18
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
Here
I
will
deal
with
the
king
of
Babylon
and
with
his
land
in
the
same
way
that
I
dealt
with
the
king
of
Assyria
19
And
I
will
bring
Israel
back
to
his
pasture
and
he
will
graze
on
Carmel
and
on
Bashan
and
on
the
mountains
of
Ephraim
and
of
Gilead
he
will
be
satisfied
20
In
those
days
and
at
that
time

declares
Jehovah
Israels
guilt
will
be
searched
for
But
there
will
be
none
And
the
sins
of
Judah
will
not
be
found
For
I
will
forgive
those
whom
I
let
remain
21
Go
up
against
the
land
of
Merathaim
and
against
the
inhabitants
of
Pekod
Let
them
be
massacred
and
completely
destroyed

declares
Jehovah
Do
all
that
I
have
commanded
you
22
There
is
the
sound
of
war
in
the
land
A
great
catastrophe
23
How
the
forge
hammer
of
all
the
earth
has
been
cut
down
and
broken
How
Babylon
has
become
an
object
of
horror
among
the
nations
24
I
have
laid
a
snare
for
you
and
you
have
been
caught
O
Babylon
And
you
did
not
know
it
You
were
found
and
captured
For
it
was
Jehovah
whom
you
opposed
25
Jehovah
has
opened
his
storehouse
And
he
brings
out
the
weapons
of
his
indignation
For
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
has
a
workIn
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
26
Come
against
her
from
distant
places
Open
up
her
granaries
Pile
her
up
like
heaps
of
grain
Destroy
her
completely
May
she
have
no
one
left
27
Massacre
all
her
young
bulls
Let
them
go
down
to
the
slaughter
Woe
to
them
for
their
day
has
come
Their
time
of
reckoning
28
There
is
the
sound
of
those
fleeing
Those
escaping
from
the
land
of
Babylon
To
declare
in
Zion
the
vengeance
of
Jehovah
our
God
The
vengeance
for
his
temple
29
Summon
archers
against
Babylon
All
who
are
bending
the
bow
Camp
all
around
her
let
no
one
escape
Repay
her
according
to
her
activity
Do
to
her
just
as
she
has
done
For
she
has
acted
arrogantly
against
Jehovah
Against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
30
So
her
young
men
will
fall
in
her
public
squares
And
all
her
soldiers
will
perish
in
that
day

declares
Jehovah
31
Look
I
am
against
you
O
defiant
one

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
armies
For
your
day
must
come
the
time
that
I
will
call
you
to
account
32
You
O
defiant
one
will
stumble
and
fall
With
no
one
to
raise
you
up
And
I
will
set
your
cities
on
fire
And
it
will
consume
everything
around
you
33
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
The
people
of
Israel
and
Judah
are
oppressed
And
all
those
taking
them
captive
have
held
onto
them
They
have
refused
to
let
them
go
34
But
their
Repurchaser
is
strong
Jehovah
of
armies
is
his
name
He
will
surely
plead
their
legal
case
In
order
to
give
rest
to
the
landAnd
to
bring
agitation
to
the
inhabitants
of
Babylon
35
There
is
a
sword
against
the
Chaldeans

declares
Jehovah
Against
the
inhabitants
of
Babylon
and
against
her
princes
and
against
her
wise
ones
36
There
is
a
sword
against
the
empty
talkers
and
they
will
act
foolishly
There
is
a
sword
against
her
warriors
and
they
will
become
terrified
37
There
is
a
sword
against
their
horses
and
their
war
chariots
And
against
all
the
mixed
populations
in
her
midst
And
they
will
become
like
women
There
is
a
sword
against
her
treasures
and
they
will
be
plundered
38
There
is
a
devastation
on
her
waters
and
they
will
be
dried
up
For
it
is
a
land
of
graven
images
And
because
of
their
frightful
visions
they
keep
acting
with
madness
39
Therefore
the
desert
creatures
will
dwell
with
the
howling
animals
And
in
her
the
ostriches
will
dwell
She
will
never
again
be
inhabited
Nor
will
she
be
a
place
of
residence
throughout
all
generations
40
Just
as
with
Gods
overthrow
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
of
their
neighboring
towns

declares
Jehovah
no
one
will
dwell
there
and
no
man
will
settle
there
41
Look
A
people
is
coming
in
from
the
north
A
great
nation
and
grand
kings
will
be
raised
upFrom
the
remotest
parts
of
the
earth
42
Bow
and
javelin
they
wield
They
are
cruel
and
will
show
no
mercy
Their
sound
is
like
the
roaring
sea
As
they
ride
on
their
horses
Like
one
man
they
line
up
in
battle
formation
against
you
O
daughter
of
Babylon
43
The
king
of
Babylon
has
heard
the
report
about
them
And
his
hands
drop
down
Anguish
seizes
him
Pain
like
that
of
a
woman
giving
birth
44
Look
Someone
will
come
up
against
the
secure
pastures
like
a
lion
from
the
dense
thickets
along
the
Jordan
but
in
a
moment
I
will
make
them
run
away
from
her
And
I
will
appoint
over
her
the
chosen
one
For
who
is
like
me
and
who
will
challenge
me
What
shepherd
can
stand
before
me
45
Therefore
hear
O
men
the
decision
that
Jehovah
has
made
against
Babylon
and
what
he
has
thought
out
against
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
Surely
the
little
ones
of
the
flock
will
be
dragged
away
He
will
make
their
dwelling
place
desolate
because
of
them
46
At
the
sound
of
Babylons
capture
the
earth
will
quake
And
an
outcry
will
be
heard
among
the
nations
1
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
raising
up
a
destructive
windAgainst
Babylon
and
the
inhabitants
of
Leb-kamai

2
I
will
send
winnowers
to
Babylon
And
they
will
winnow
her
and
make
her
land
empty
They
will
come
against
her
on
all
sides
in
the
day
of
calamity

3
Let
the
archer
not
bend
his
bow
And
let
no
one
stand
up
in
his
coat
of
mail
Show
no
compassion
for
her
young
men
Devote
all
her
army
to
destruction

4
And
they
will
fall
slain
in
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
Pierced
through
in
her
streets

5
For
Israel
and
Judah
are
not
widowed
from
their
God
from
Jehovah
of
armies
But
their
land
is
full
of
guilt
from
the
standpoint
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel

6
Flee
out
of
the
midst
of
Babylon
And
escape
for
your
life
Do
not
perish
because
of
her
error
For
it
is
the
time
for
Jehovahs
vengeance
He
is
paying
her
back
for
what
she
has
done

7
Babylon
has
been
a
golden
cup
in
the
hand
of
Jehovah
She
made
all
the
earth
drunk
From
her
wine
the
nations
have
drunk
That
is
why
the
nations
have
gone
mad

8
Suddenly
Babylon
has
fallen
and
is
broken
Wail
over
her
Get
balsam
for
her
pain
perhaps
she
may
be
healed

9
We
tried
to
heal
Babylon
but
she
could
not
be
healed
Leave
her
and
let
us
go
each
to
his
own
land
For
her
judgment
has
reached
to
the
heavens
It
is
as
high
as
the
clouds
10
Jehovah
has
brought
about
justice
for
us
Come
let
us
recount
in
Zion
the
work
of
Jehovah
our
God
11
Polish
the
arrows
take
up
the
circular
shields
Jehovah
has
stirred
up
the
spirit
of
the
kings
of
the
Medes
Because
he
intends
to
bring
Babylon
to
ruin
For
this
is
the
vengeance
of
Jehovah
the
vengeance
for
his
temple
12
Lift
up
a
signal
against
the
walls
of
Babylon
Strengthen
the
guard
post
the
watchmen
Prepare
those
in
ambush
For
Jehovah
has
devised
the
strategy
And
he
will
carry
out
what
he
has
promised
against
the
inhabitants
of
Babylon
13
O
woman
who
resides
on
many
waters
With
abundant
treasures
Your
end
has
come
the
limit
of
your
profit-making
14
Jehovah
of
armies
has
sworn
by
himself
I
will
fill
you
with
men
as
numerous
as
locusts
And
they
will
shout
in
triumph
over
you
15
He
is
the
Maker
of
the
earth
by
his
power
The
One
who
established
the
productive
land
by
his
wisdomAnd
who
stretched
out
the
heavens
by
his
understanding
16
When
he
makes
his
voice
heard
The
waters
in
the
heavens
are
in
turmoil
And
he
causes
clouds
to
ascend
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
He
makes
lightning
for
the
rain
And
he
brings
the
wind
out
of
his
storehouses
17
Every
man
acts
unreasonably
and
without
knowledge
Every
metalworker
will
be
put
to
shame
because
of
the
carved
image
For
his
metal
image
is
a
falsehood
And
there
is
no
spirit
in
them
18
They
are
a
delusion
a
work
of
mockery
When
their
day
of
reckoning
comes
they
will
perish
19
The
Share
of
Jacob
is
not
like
these
things
For
he
is
the
One
who
formed
everything
Even
the
staff
of
his
inheritance
Jehovah
of
armies
is
his
name
20
You
are
a
war
club
for
me
a
weapon
for
battle
For
with
you
I
will
smash
nations
With
you
I
will
bring
kingdoms
to
ruin
21
With
you
I
will
smash
the
horse
and
its
rider
With
you
I
will
smash
the
war
chariot
and
its
rider
22
With
you
I
will
smash
man
and
woman
With
you
I
will
smash
old
man
and
boy
With
you
I
will
smash
young
man
and
woman
23
With
you
I
will
smash
shepherd
and
his
flock
With
you
I
will
smash
farmer
and
his
team
of
animals
With
you
I
will
smash
governors
and
deputy
rulers
24
And
I
will
repay
Babylon
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
ChaldeaFor
all
the
evil
that
they
have
committed
in
Zion
before
your
eyes

declares
Jehovah
25
Here
I
am
against
you
O
destructive
mountain

declares
Jehovah
You
destroyer
of
the
whole
earth
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand
against
you
and
roll
you
down
from
the
cragsAnd
make
you
a
burned-out
mountain
26
People
will
not
take
from
you
a
cornerstone
or
a
foundation
stone
Because
you
will
become
desolate
forever

declares
Jehovah
27
Lift
up
a
signal
in
the
land
Blow
a
horn
among
the
nations
Appoint
the
nations
against
her
Summon
against
her
the
kingdoms
of
Ararat
Minni
and
Ashkenaz
Commission
against
her
a
recruiting
officer
Make
the
horses
come
up
like
bristling
locusts
28
Appoint
against
her
the
nations
The
kings
of
Media
its
governors
and
all
its
deputy
rulersAnd
all
the
lands
they
rule
over
29
And
the
earth
will
quake
and
tremble
For
the
thoughts
of
Jehovah
against
Babylon
will
be
carried
outTo
make
the
land
of
Babylon
an
object
of
horror
without
an
inhabitant
30
The
warriors
of
Babylon
have
quit
fighting
They
sit
in
their
strongholds
Their
strength
has
failed
They
have
become
like
women
Her
homes
have
been
set
on
fire
Her
bars
have
been
broken
31
One
courier
runs
to
meet
another
courier
And
one
messenger
to
meet
another
messenger
To
report
to
the
king
of
Babylon
that
his
city
has
been
captured
on
every
side
32
That
the
fords
have
been
seized
That
the
papyrus
boats
have
been
burned
with
fire
And
that
the
soldiers
are
terrified
33
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
says
The
daughter
of
Babylon
is
like
a
threshing
floor
It
is
the
time
to
tread
her
down
solid
Very
soon
the
time
of
the
harvest
will
come
for
her
34
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
has
devoured
me
He
has
thrown
me
into
confusion
He
has
set
me
down
as
an
empty
vessel
He
has
swallowed
me
down
like
a
big
snake
He
has
filled
his
stomach
with
my
fine
things
He
has
rinsed
me
away
35
May
the
violence
done
to
me
and
to
my
person
come
upon
Babylon
says
the
inhabitant
of
Zion
And
let
my
blood
come
upon
the
inhabitants
of
Chaldea
says
Jerusalem
36
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
pleading
your
legal
case
And
I
will
execute
vengeance
for
you
I
will
dry
up
her
sea
and
make
her
wells
dry
37
And
Babylon
will
become
piles
of
stones
A
lair
of
jackals
An
object
of
horror
and
something
to
whistle
at
Without
an
inhabitant
38
All
together
they
will
roar
just
like
young
lions
They
will
growl
like
lion
cubs
39
When
they
are
inflamed
I
will
set
out
their
banquet
and
make
them
drunk
In
order
that
they
may
exult
Then
they
will
sleep
a
lasting
sleep
From
which
they
will
not
wake
up

declares
Jehovah
40
I
will
bring
them
down
like
lambs
to
the
slaughter
Like
rams
along
with
the
goats
41
O
how
Sheshach
has
been
captured
How
the
Praise
of
the
whole
earth
has
been
seized
How
Babylon
has
become
an
object
of
horror
among
the
nations
42
The
sea
has
come
up
over
Babylon
By
the
multitude
of
its
waves
she
has
been
covered
43
Her
cities
have
become
an
object
of
horror
a
waterless
land
and
a
desert
A
land
where
no
one
will
live
and
where
no
man
will
pass
through
44
I
will
turn
my
attention
to
Bel
in
Babylon
And
I
will
take
out
of
his
mouth
what
he
has
swallowed
To
him
nations
will
stream
no
more
And
the
wall
of
Babylon
will
fall
45
Get
out
of
her
midst
my
people
Escape
for
your
lives
from
the
burning
anger
of
Jehovah
46
Do
not
be
fainthearted
or
afraid
about
the
report
to
be
heard
in
the
land
In
one
year
the
report
will
come
And
the
next
year
another
report
Of
violence
in
the
land
and
of
ruler
against
ruler
47
Therefore
look
the
days
are
comingWhen
I
will
turn
my
attention
to
the
graven
images
of
Babylon
All
her
land
will
be
put
to
shame
And
all
her
slain
will
fall
in
her
midst
48
The
heavens
and
the
earth
and
everything
in
themWill
shout
joyfully
over
Babylon
For
the
destroyers
will
come
to
her
out
of
the
north

declares
Jehovah
49
Not
only
did
Babylon
cause
the
slain
of
Israel
to
fallBut
also
at
Babylon
the
slain
ones
of
all
the
earth
have
fallen
50
You
who
escape
the
sword
keep
going
do
not
stand
still
Remember
Jehovah
from
far
away
And
may
Jerusalem
come
up
into
your
heart
51
We
have
been
put
to
shame
for
we
have
heard
taunts
Humiliation
has
covered
our
faces
For
foreigners
have
come
against
the
holy
places
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
52
Therefore
look
the
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
When
I
will
turn
my
attention
to
her
graven
images
And
throughout
all
her
land
the
wounded
will
groan
53
Even
if
Babylon
should
ascend
to
the
heavens
Even
if
she
should
fortify
her
towering
strongholds
From
me
her
destroyers
will
come

declares
Jehovah
54
Listen
There
is
an
outcry
from
Babylon
The
sound
of
great
disaster
from
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
55
For
Jehovah
is
destroying
Babylon
He
will
silence
her
great
voice
And
their
waves
will
roar
like
many
waters
The
sound
of
their
voice
will
be
heard
56
For
the
destroyer
will
come
upon
Babylon
Her
warriors
will
be
captured
Their
bows
will
be
shattered
For
Jehovah
is
a
God
of
retribution
He
will
surely
repay
57
I
will
make
her
princes
and
her
wise
men
drunk
Her
governors
and
her
deputy
rulers
and
her
warriors
And
they
will
sleep
a
lasting
sleep
From
which
they
will
not
wake
up

declares
the
King
whose
name
is
Jehovah
of
armies
58
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
The
wall
of
Babylon
though
broad
will
be
completely
demolished
And
her
gates
though
high
will
be
set
on
fire
The
peoples
will
toil
for
nothing
The
nations
will
weary
themselves
just
to
feed
the
fire
59
This
is
the
word
that
Jeremiah
the
prophet
gave
as
a
command
to
Seraiah
son
of
Neriah
son
of
Mahseiah
when
he
went
with
King
Zedekiah
of
Judah
to
Babylon
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
reign
Seraiah
was
the
quartermaster
60
Jeremiah
wrote
in
one
book
all
the
calamity
that
would
come
upon
Babylon
all
these
words
written
against
Babylon
61
Furthermore
Jeremiah
said
to
Seraiah
When
you
come
to
Babylon
and
see
her
you
must
read
aloud
all
these
words
62
Then
say
O
Jehovah
you
have
said
against
this
place
that
it
will
be
destroyed
and
left
without
an
inhabitant
man
or
beast
and
that
she
will
become
desolate
forever
63
And
when
you
finish
reading
this
book
tie
a
stone
to
it
and
throw
it
into
the
middle
of
the
Euphrates
64
Then
say
This
is
how
Babylon
will
sink
down
and
never
rise
again
because
of
the
calamity
that
I
am
bringing
on
her
and
they
will
grow
weary
Down
to
this
point
are
the
words
of
Jeremiah
1
Zedekiah
was
21
years
old
when
he
became
king
and
he
reigned
for
11
years
in
Jerusalem
His
mothers
name
was
Hamutal
the
daughter
of
Jeremiah
of
Libnah
2
He
continued
to
do
what
was
bad
in
Jehovahs
eyes
according
to
all
that
Jehoiakim
had
done
3
It
was
because
of
Jehovahs
anger
that
these
things
took
place
in
Jerusalem
and
in
Judah
until
he
cast
them
out
of
his
sight
And
Zedekiah
rebelled
against
the
king
of
Babylon
4
In
the
ninth
year
of
Zedekiahs
reign
in
the
tenth
month
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
came
with
all
his
army
against
Jerusalem
They
camped
against
it
and
built
a
siege
wall
all
around
it
5
And
the
city
was
under
siege
until
the
11th
year
of
King
Zedekiah
6
In
the
fourth
month
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
the
famine
was
severe
in
the
city
and
there
was
no
food
for
the
people
of
the
land
7
Finally
the
city
wall
was
broken
through
and
all
the
soldiers
fled
from
the
city
by
night
through
the
gate
between
the
double
wall
near
the
kings
garden
while
the
Chaldeans
were
surrounding
the
city
and
they
continued
by
the
way
of
the
Arabah
8
But
the
Chaldean
army
pursued
the
king
and
they
overtook
Zedekiah
in
the
desert
plains
of
Jericho
and
all
his
troops
were
scattered
from
his
side
9
Then
they
seized
the
king
and
brought
him
up
to
the
king
of
Babylon
at
Riblah
in
the
land
of
Hamath
and
he
passed
sentence
on
him
10
And
the
king
of
Babylon
slaughtered
Zedekiahs
sons
before
his
eyes
and
he
also
slaughtered
all
the
princes
of
Judah
there
at
Riblah
11
Then
the
king
of
Babylon
blinded
Zedekiahs
eyes
bound
him
with
copper
fetters
brought
him
to
Babylon
and
kept
him
imprisoned
until
the
day
of
his
death
12
In
the
fifth
month
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
that
is
in
the
19th
year
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
Babylon
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
who
was
an
attendant
of
the
king
of
Babylon
came
into
Jerusalem
13
He
burned
down
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
kings
house
and
all
the
houses
of
Jerusalem
he
also
burned
down
every
large
house
14
And
the
walls
surrounding
Jerusalem
were
pulled
down
by
the
entire
Chaldean
army
that
was
with
the
chief
of
the
guard
15
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
took
into
exile
some
of
the
lowly
people
and
the
rest
of
the
people
who
were
left
in
the
city
He
also
took
the
deserters
who
had
defected
to
the
king
of
Babylon
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
master
craftsmen
16
But
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
left
some
of
the
poorest
people
of
the
land
to
serve
as
vinedressers
and
as
compulsory
laborers
17
And
the
Chaldeans
broke
into
pieces
the
copper
pillars
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
carriages
and
the
copper
Sea
that
were
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
they
carried
all
the
copper
away
to
Babylon
18
They
also
took
the
cans
the
shovels
the
extinguishers
the
bowls
the
cups
and
all
the
copper
utensils
used
in
the
temple
service
19
The
chief
of
the
guard
took
the
basins
the
fire
holders
the
bowls
the
cans
the
lampstands
the
cups
and
the
bowls
that
were
of
genuine
gold
and
silver
20
As
for
the
two
pillars
the
Sea
the
12
copper
bulls
under
the
Sea
and
the
carriages
that
King
Solomon
had
made
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
copper
of
all
these
articles
was
beyond
weighing
21
As
for
the
pillars
each
pillar
was
18
cubits
high
a
measuring
cord
of
12
cubits
could
encircle
it
its
thickness
was
four
fingerbreadths
and
it
was
hollow
22
And
the
capital
on
it
was
of
copper
and
the
height
of
the
one
capital
was
five
cubits
and
the
network
and
pomegranates
all
around
on
the
capital
were
all
made
of
copper
The
second
pillar
was
just
like
it
also
the
pomegranates
23
There
were
96
pomegranates
on
the
sides
in
all
there
were
100
pomegranates
around
the
network
24
The
chief
of
the
guard
also
took
Seraiah
the
chief
priest
Zephaniah
the
second
priest
and
the
three
doorkeepers
25
And
he
took
from
the
city
one
court
official
who
was
the
commissioner
over
the
soldiers
seven
close
associates
of
the
king
who
were
found
in
the
city
as
well
as
the
secretary
of
the
chief
of
the
army
the
one
mustering
the
people
of
the
land
and
60
men
of
the
common
people
of
the
land
who
were
yet
found
in
the
city
26
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
took
them
and
brought
them
to
the
king
of
Babylon
at
Riblah
27
The
king
of
Babylon
struck
them
down
and
put
them
to
death
at
Riblah
in
the
land
of
Hamath
Thus
Judah
went
into
exile
from
its
land
28
These
are
the
people
whom
Nebuchadnezzar
took
into
exile
in
the
seventh
year
3023
Jews
29
In
the
18th
year
of
Nebuchadnezzar
832
people
were
taken
from
Jerusalem
30
In
the
23rd
year
of
Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuzaradan
the
chief
of
the
guard
took
Jews
into
exile
745
people
In
all
4600
people
were
taken
into
exile
31
Then
in
the
37th
year
of
the
exile
of
King
Jehoiachin
of
Judah
in
the
12th
month
on
the
25th
day
of
the
month
King
Evil-merodach
of
Babylon
in
the
year
he
became
king
released
King
Jehoiachin
of
Judah
and
brought
him
out
of
prison
32
He
spoke
kindly
with
him
and
put
his
throne
higher
than
the
thrones
of
the
other
kings
who
were
with
him
in
Babylon
33
So
Jehoiachin
took
off
his
prison
garments
and
he
regularly
ate
before
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
34
A
regular
allowance
of
food
was
given
him
from
the
king
of
Babylon
day
after
day
until
the
day
of
his
death
all
the
days
of
his
life
1
How
she
now
sits
all
alone
the
city
that
was
full
of
people
How
she
has
become
like
a
widow
she
who
was
populous
among
the
nations
How
she
who
was
a
princess
among
the
provinces
has
been
put
to
forced
labor

2
She
weeps
profusely
during
the
night
and
her
tears
cover
her
cheeks
Not
one
of
all
her
lovers
is
there
to
comfort
her
All
her
own
companions
have
betrayed
her
they
have
become
her
enemies

3
Judah
has
gone
into
exile
under
affliction
and
harsh
slavery
She
must
dwell
among
the
nations
she
finds
no
resting-place
All
her
persecutors
have
overtaken
her
in
her
distress

4
The
roads
to
Zion
are
mourning
because
no
one
is
coming
to
the
festival
All
her
gates
are
desolate
her
priests
are
sighing
Her
virgins
are
grieving
and
she
is
in
bitter
anguish

5
Her
adversaries
are
now
her
master
her
enemies
are
carefree
For
Jehovah
has
brought
grief
to
her
because
of
her
many
transgressions
Her
children
have
gone
into
captivity
before
the
adversary

6
All
the
splendor
has
departed
from
the
daughter
of
Zion
Her
princes
are
like
stags
that
have
found
no
pasture
And
they
walk
exhausted
before
the
pursuer

7
In
the
days
of
her
affliction
and
her
homelessness
Jerusalem
remembersAll
the
precious
things
that
were
hers
in
the
days
of
long
ago
When
her
people
fell
into
the
hand
of
the
adversary
and
she
had
no
helper
The
adversaries
saw
her
and
laughed
over
her
collapse

8
Jerusalem
has
sinned
greatly
That
is
why
she
has
become
something
abhorrent
All
who
used
to
honor
her
now
treat
her
as
something
contemptible
for
they
have
seen
her
nakedness
She
herself
groans
and
turns
away
in
shame

9
Her
uncleanness
is
in
her
skirts
She
gave
no
thought
to
her
future
Her
downfall
was
astounding
she
has
no
one
to
comfort
her
O
Jehovah
see
my
affliction
for
the
enemy
has
magnified
himself
10
The
adversary
has
laid
his
hands
on
all
her
treasures
For
she
has
seen
nations
enter
her
sanctuary
Those
whom
you
commanded
should
not
enter
into
your
congregation
11
All
her
people
are
sighing
they
are
looking
for
bread
They
have
given
their
valuable
things
for
something
to
eat
just
to
stay
alive
Look
O
Jehovah
and
see
that
I
have
become
as
a
worthless
woman
12
Is
it
nothing
to
all
of
you
who
pass
along
the
road
Look
and
see
Is
there
any
pain
like
the
pain
that
was
dealt
out
to
me
Which
Jehovah
made
me
suffer
in
the
day
of
his
burning
anger
13
From
on
high
he
has
sent
fire
into
my
bones
and
he
subdues
each
one
He
has
spread
out
a
net
for
my
feet
he
has
forced
me
to
turn
backward
He
has
made
me
a
desolate
woman
All
day
long
I
am
ill
14
My
transgressions
are
bound
as
a
yoke
fastened
together
by
his
hand
They
have
been
placed
on
my
neck
and
my
strength
has
failed
Jehovah
has
given
me
into
the
hand
of
those
whom
I
cannot
resist
15
Jehovah
has
tossed
aside
all
the
powerful
men
in
my
midst
He
has
summoned
an
assembly
against
me
to
crush
my
young
men
Jehovah
has
trodden
the
virgin
daughter
of
Judah
in
the
winepress
16
I
am
weeping
because
of
these
things
my
eyes
flow
with
tears
For
anyone
who
could
comfort
me
or
refresh
me
is
far
away
from
me
My
sons
are
desolate
for
the
enemy
has
prevailed
17
Zion
has
spread
out
her
hands
she
has
no
one
to
comfort
her
Jehovah
has
given
an
order
against
Jacob
to
all
his
adversaries
around
him
Jerusalem
has
become
to
them
an
abhorrent
thing
18
Jehovah
is
righteous
for
it
is
against
his
commands
that
I
have
rebelled
Listen
all
you
peoples
and
see
my
pain
My
virgins
and
my
young
men
have
gone
into
captivity
19
I
have
called
out
to
my
lovers
but
they
have
betrayed
me
In
the
city
my
priests
and
my
elders
have
perished
While
they
searched
for
food
in
order
to
stay
alive
20
See
O
Jehovah
for
I
am
in
great
distress
My
insides
are
churning
My
heart
has
turned
over
within
me
for
I
have
been
completely
rebellious
Outside
the
sword
bereaves
inside
the
house
it
is
like
death
21
People
have
heard
my
sighing
there
is
no
one
to
comfort
me
All
my
enemies
have
heard
of
my
calamity
They
are
joyful
because
you
brought
it
about
But
you
will
bring
about
the
day
that
you
proclaimed
when
they
will
become
like
me
22
May
all
their
badness
come
before
you
and
may
you
deal
harshly
with
them
Just
as
you
have
dealt
harshly
with
me
because
of
all
my
transgressions
For
my
sighs
are
many
and
my
heart
is
sick
1
How
Jehovah
has
covered
the
daughter
of
Zion
in
the
cloud
of
his
anger
He
has
thrown
down
the
beauty
of
Israel
from
heaven
to
earth
He
has
not
remembered
his
footstool
in
the
day
of
his
anger

2
Jehovah
has
swallowed
up
without
compassion
all
the
dwellings
of
Jacob
In
his
fury
he
has
torn
down
the
fortified
places
of
the
daughter
of
Judah
He
has
brought
down
to
the
ground
and
profaned
the
kingdom
and
her
princes

3
In
the
heat
of
anger
he
has
cut
down
all
the
strength
of
Israel
He
withdrew
his
right
hand
when
the
enemy
approached
And
in
Jacob
he
kept
burning
like
a
fire
that
consumed
everything
around
it

4
He
has
bent
his
bow
like
an
enemy
his
right
hand
is
poised
as
an
adversary
He
kept
killing
all
those
desirable
to
the
eyes
And
he
poured
out
his
wrath
like
a
fire
into
the
tent
of
the
daughter
of
Zion

5
Jehovah
has
become
like
an
enemy
He
has
swallowed
down
Israel
He
has
swallowed
down
all
her
towers
He
has
destroyed
all
its
fortified
places
And
in
the
daughter
of
Judah
he
makes
mourning
and
lamentation
abound

6
He
treats
his
booth
violently
like
a
hut
in
a
garden
He
has
put
an
end
to
his
festival
Jehovah
has
caused
festival
and
sabbath
to
be
forgotten
in
Zion
And
in
his
fierce
indignation
he
shows
no
regard
for
king
and
priest

7
Jehovah
has
rejected
his
altar
He
has
spurned
his
sanctuary
He
has
surrendered
the
walls
of
her
fortified
towers
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
They
have
raised
their
voice
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
as
on
the
day
of
a
festival

8
Jehovah
has
resolved
to
destroy
the
wall
of
the
daughter
of
Zion
He
has
stretched
out
the
measuring
line
He
has
not
held
back
his
hand
from
bringing
destruction
And
he
causes
rampart
and
wall
to
mourn
Together
they
have
been
made
weak

9
Her
gates
have
sunk
down
into
the
earth
He
has
destroyed
and
broken
her
bars
Her
king
and
her
princes
are
among
the
nations
There
is
no
law
even
her
prophets
find
no
vision
from
Jehovah
10
The
elders
of
the
daughter
of
Zion
sit
on
the
ground
in
silence
They
throw
dust
on
their
heads
and
wear
sackcloth
The
virgins
of
Jerusalem
have
bowed
their
heads
down
to
the
ground
11
My
eyes
are
worn
out
from
shedding
tears
My
insides
are
churning
My
liver
has
been
poured
out
on
the
ground
because
of
the
downfall
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
Because
of
the
children
and
infants
fainting
away
in
the
public
squares
of
the
town
12
They
keep
asking
their
mothers
Where
are
grain
and
wine
As
they
faint
away
like
someone
wounded
in
the
public
squares
of
the
city
As
their
life
ebbs
away
in
their
mothers
arms
13
What
can
I
use
as
a
witness
Or
to
what
can
I
liken
you
O
daughter
of
Jerusalem
To
what
can
I
compare
you
to
comfort
you
O
virgin
daughter
of
Zion
For
your
breakdown
is
as
vast
as
the
sea
Who
can
heal
you
14
The
visions
your
prophets
saw
for
you
were
false
and
empty
And
they
did
not
expose
your
error
in
order
to
turn
away
your
captivity
But
they
kept
visioning
for
you
false
and
misleading
pronouncements
15
At
you
all
those
passing
by
on
the
road
scornfully
clap
their
hands
They
whistle
in
amazement
and
shake
their
heads
at
the
daughter
of
Jerusalem
saying
Is
this
the
city
about
which
they
said
It
is
perfect
in
beauty
the
joy
of
all
the
earth
16
At
you
all
your
enemies
have
opened
their
mouth
They
whistle
and
grind
their
teeth
and
say
We
have
swallowed
her
down
This
is
the
day
we
were
waiting
for
It
has
arrived
and
we
have
seen
it
17
Jehovah
has
done
what
he
intended
he
has
carried
out
his
saying
What
he
commanded
long
ago
He
has
torn
down
without
compassion
He
has
let
the
enemy
rejoice
over
you
he
has
exalted
the
strength
of
your
adversaries
18
Their
heart
cries
out
to
Jehovah
O
wall
of
the
daughter
of
Zion
Let
tears
stream
down
like
a
torrent
day
and
night
Give
yourself
no
respite
give
your
eye
no
rest
19
Rise
up
Cry
out
during
the
night
at
the
start
of
the
watches
Pour
out
your
heart
like
water
before
the
face
of
Jehovah
Raise
your
hands
to
him
for
the
lives
of
your
children
Who
are
fainting
away
at
every
street
corner
because
of
famine
20
See
O
Jehovah
and
look
upon
the
one
with
whom
you
have
dealt
so
harshly
Should
women
keep
eating
their
own
offspring
their
own
fully
formed
children
Or
should
priests
and
prophets
be
killed
in
the
sanctuary
of
Jehovah
21
Young
boy
and
old
man
are
lying
dead
on
the
ground
in
the
streets
My
virgins
and
my
young
men
have
fallen
by
the
sword
You
have
killed
in
the
day
of
your
anger
you
have
slaughtered
without
compassion
22
As
if
for
a
festival
day
you
summon
terrors
from
every
direction
In
the
day
of
the
wrath
of
Jehovah
no
one
escaped
or
survived
Those
whom
I
gave
birth
to
and
reared
my
enemy
exterminated
1
I
am
the
man
who
has
seen
affliction
because
of
the
rod
of
his
fury

2
He
has
driven
me
out
and
makes
me
walk
in
darkness
not
in
light

3
Indeed
he
repeatedly
brings
his
hand
against
me
all
day
long

4
He
has
worn
away
my
flesh
and
my
skin
He
has
broken
my
bones

5
He
has
besieged
me
he
has
surrounded
me
with
bitter
poison
and
hardship

6
He
has
forced
me
to
sit
in
dark
places
like
men
who
died
long
ago

7
He
has
walled
me
in
so
that
I
cannot
escape
He
has
bound
me
with
heavy
copper
fetters

8
And
when
I
cry
out
desperately
for
help
he
rejects
my
prayer

9
He
has
blocked
up
my
paths
with
hewn
stones
He
has
made
my
roadways
crooked
10
He
waits
to
ambush
me
like
a
bear
like
a
lion
in
hiding
11
He
has
forced
me
off
the
paths
and
torn
me
to
pieces
He
has
made
me
desolate
12
He
has
bent
his
bow
and
he
sets
me
up
as
the
target
for
the
arrow
13
He
has
pierced
my
kidneys
with
the
arrows
of
his
quiver
14
I
have
become
a
laughingstock
to
all
the
peoples
the
theme
of
their
song
all
day
long
15
He
has
filled
me
with
bitter
things
and
saturated
me
with
wormwood
16
He
breaks
my
teeth
with
gravel
He
makes
me
cower
in
the
ashes
17
You
deprive
me
of
peace
I
have
forgotten
what
is
good
18
So
I
say
My
splendor
has
perished
as
well
as
my
expectation
in
Jehovah
19
Remember
my
affliction
and
my
homeless
state
the
wormwood
and
the
bitter
poison
20
You
will
surely
remember
and
bow
low
over
me
21
I
recall
this
in
my
heart
that
is
why
I
will
show
a
waiting
attitude
22
It
is
because
of
Jehovahs
loyal
love
that
we
have
not
come
to
our
finish
For
his
mercies
never
end
23
They
are
new
each
morning
your
faithfulness
is
abundant
24
Jehovah
is
my
share

I
have
said
that
is
why
I
will
show
a
waiting
attitude
for
him
25
Good
is
Jehovah
to
the
one
hoping
in
him
to
the
person
who
keeps
seeking
him
26
Good
it
is
to
wait
in
silence
for
the
salvation
of
Jehovah
27
Good
it
is
for
a
man
to
carry
the
yoke
during
his
youth
28
Let
him
sit
alone
and
keep
silent
when
He
lays
it
upon
him
29
Let
him
put
his
mouth
in
the
very
dust
there
may
yet
be
hope
30
Let
him
give
his
cheek
to
the
one
striking
him
let
him
have
his
fill
of
insults
31
For
Jehovah
will
not
cast
us
off
forever
32
Although
he
has
caused
grief
he
will
also
show
mercy
according
to
his
abundant
loyal
love
33
For
it
is
not
in
his
heart
to
afflict
or
grieve
the
sons
of
men
34
To
crush
beneath
ones
feet
all
the
prisoners
of
the
earth
35
To
deprive
a
man
of
justice
in
the
presence
of
the
Most
High
36
To
defraud
a
man
in
his
legal
case—Jehovah
does
not
tolerate
such
things
37
Who
then
can
speak
and
have
it
happen
unless
Jehovah
commands
it
38
From
the
mouth
of
the
Most
High
Bad
things
and
good
things
do
not
go
out
together
39
Why
should
a
living
person
complain
about
the
consequences
of
his
sin
40
Let
us
examine
and
scrutinize
our
ways
and
let
us
return
to
Jehovah
41
Let
us
lift
up
our
hearts
along
with
our
hands
to
God
in
the
heavens
42
We
have
transgressed
and
rebelled
and
you
have
not
forgiven
43
With
anger
you
have
blocked
our
approach
You
have
pursued
and
killed
us
without
compassion
44
You
have
blocked
approach
to
yourself
with
a
cloud
so
that
our
prayer
may
not
pass
through
45
You
make
us
offscouring
and
refuse
among
the
peoples
46
All
our
enemies
open
their
mouths
against
us
47
Dread
and
pitfalls
have
become
our
lot
desolation
and
breakdown
48
Streams
of
water
flow
from
my
eyes
over
the
breakdown
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
49
My
eyes
weep
without
ceasing
without
pausing
50
Until
Jehovah
looks
down
and
sees
from
heaven
51
My
eyes
have
brought
me
grief
because
of
all
the
daughters
of
my
city
52
Without
cause
my
enemies
have
hunted
me
down
like
a
bird
53
They
have
silenced
my
life
in
the
pit
they
kept
hurling
stones
at
me
54
Waters
flowed
over
my
head
and
I
said
I
am
finished
55
I
called
out
your
name
O
Jehovah
from
the
depths
of
the
pit
56
Hear
my
voice
do
not
shut
your
ear
to
my
cry
for
help
for
relief
57
You
drew
near
in
the
day
that
I
called
you
You
said
Do
not
be
afraid
58
You
have
defended
my
cause
O
Jehovah
you
have
redeemed
my
life
59
You
have
seen
O
Jehovah
the
wrong
done
to
me
please
grant
me
justice
60
You
have
seen
all
their
vengeance
all
their
schemes
against
me
61
You
have
heard
their
taunts
O
Jehovah
all
their
schemes
against
me
62
The
lips
of
my
opposers
and
their
whispering
against
me
all
day
long
63
Look
at
them
whether
they
sit
or
stand
they
mock
me
in
their
songs
64
You
will
repay
them
O
Jehovah
according
to
their
deeds
65
You
will
make
them
hardhearted
as
your
curse
to
them
66
You
will
pursue
them
in
your
anger
and
annihilate
them
from
under
the
heavens
of
Jehovah
1
How
the
shining
gold
has
grown
dim
the
fine
gold
How
the
holy
stones
lie
scattered
at
every
street
corner

2
As
for
the
precious
sons
of
Zion
who
were
weighed
against
refined
gold
How
they
have
been
regarded
as
earthenware
jars
The
work
of
a
potters
hands

3
Even
jackals
offer
the
udder
to
nurse
their
young
But
the
daughter
of
my
people
has
become
cruel
like
ostriches
in
the
wilderness

4
The
tongue
of
the
nursing
infant
sticks
to
its
palate
because
of
thirst
Children
beg
for
bread
but
no
one
gives
them
any

5
Those
who
used
to
eat
delicacies
lie
famished
in
the
streets
Those
who
were
brought
up
wearing
scarlet
have
embraced
ash
heaps

6
The
punishment
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
is
greater
than
the
punishment
for
the
sin
of
Sodom
Which
was
overthrown
in
a
moment
with
no
hand
to
help
her

7
Her
Nazirites
were
purer
than
snow
whiter
than
milk
They
were
more
ruddy
than
corals
they
were
like
polished
sapphires

8
Their
appearance
has
become
darker
than
soot
They
are
not
recognized
in
the
streets
Their
skin
has
shriveled
over
their
bones
it
has
become
like
dry
wood

9
Those
slain
with
the
sword
are
better
off
than
those
slain
by
famine
Those
who
waste
away
who
are
pierced
through
for
lack
of
food
from
the
field
10
The
hands
of
compassionate
women
have
boiled
their
own
children
They
have
become
their
food
of
mourning
during
the
breakdown
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
11
Jehovah
has
expressed
his
wrath
He
has
poured
out
his
burning
anger
And
he
starts
a
fire
in
Zion
that
consumes
her
foundations
12
The
kings
of
the
earth
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
productive
land
did
not
believeThat
the
adversary
and
the
enemy
would
enter
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
13
It
was
because
of
the
sins
of
her
prophets
the
errors
of
her
priests
Who
shed
the
blood
of
righteous
ones
in
her
midst
14
They
have
wandered
blindly
in
the
streets
They
are
polluted
with
blood
So
that
none
are
able
to
touch
their
garments
15
Go
away
Unclean
they
call
out
to
them
Go
away
Go
away
Do
not
touch
us
For
they
have
gone
homeless
and
wander
about
People
have
said
among
the
nations
They
cannot
stay
here
with
us
16
The
face
of
Jehovah
has
scattered
them
He
will
no
longer
look
favorably
on
them
Men
will
show
no
respect
for
the
priests
no
favor
to
the
elders
17
Even
now
our
eyes
are
worn
out
from
looking
in
vain
for
help
We
looked
and
looked
for
help
from
a
nation
that
could
not
save
us
18
They
have
hunted
us
down
at
every
step
so
that
we
could
not
walk
in
our
public
squares
Our
end
has
drawn
near
our
days
have
finished
for
our
end
has
come
19
Our
pursuers
were
swifter
than
the
eagles
of
the
sky
They
chased
us
on
the
mountains
they
ambushed
us
in
the
wilderness
20
The
breath
of
our
nostrils
the
anointed
one
of
Jehovah
has
been
captured
in
their
large
pit
The
one
of
whom
we
said
In
his
shade
we
will
live
among
the
nations
21
Exult
and
rejoice
O
daughter
of
Edom
living
as
you
do
in
the
land
of
Uz
But
to
you
also
the
cup
will
be
passed
and
you
will
become
drunk
and
expose
your
nakedness
22
The
punishment
for
your
error
O
daughter
of
Zion
has
come
to
its
finish
He
will
not
carry
you
off
into
exile
again
But
he
will
turn
his
attention
to
your
error
O
daughter
of
Edom
He
will
uncover
your
sins
1
Remember
O
Jehovah
what
has
befallen
us
Look
and
see
our
disgrace

2
Our
inheritance
has
been
turned
over
to
strangers
our
houses
to
foreigners

3
We
have
become
orphans
without
a
father
our
mothers
are
like
widows

4
We
must
pay
to
drink
our
own
water
and
our
own
wood
comes
at
a
price

5
Those
pursuing
us
are
at
our
neck
We
are
weary
but
we
are
given
no
rest

6
We
hold
out
our
hand
to
Egypt
and
to
Assyria
to
get
enough
bread
to
eat

7
Our
forefathers
who
sinned
are
no
more
but
we
must
bear
their
errors

8
Servants
now
rule
over
us
there
is
no
one
to
snatch
us
from
their
hand

9
We
bring
in
our
bread
at
the
risk
of
our
life
because
of
the
sword
of
the
wilderness
10
Our
skin
has
become
as
hot
as
a
furnace
because
of
the
pangs
of
hunger
11
The
wives
in
Zion
they
have
humiliated
the
virgins
in
the
cities
of
Judah
12
Princes
were
hanged
by
their
hand
and
elders
were
shown
no
respect
13
Young
men
carry
the
hand
mill
and
boys
stumble
under
loads
of
wood
14
The
elders
are
gone
from
the
city
gate
young
men
do
not
play
their
music
15
The
joy
is
gone
from
our
heart
our
dancing
has
turned
into
mourning
16
The
crown
has
fallen
from
our
head
Woe
to
us
because
we
have
sinned
17
Because
of
this
our
heart
is
sick
And
because
of
these
things
our
eyes
have
grown
dim
18
Because
of
Mount
Zion
which
is
desolate
foxes
now
roam
on
it
19
As
for
you
O
Jehovah
you
sit
enthroned
forever
Your
throne
is
for
generation
after
generation
20
Why
do
you
forget
us
forever
and
abandon
us
for
so
long
a
time
21
Bring
us
back
to
yourself
O
Jehovah
and
we
will
readily
return
to
you
Renew
our
days
as
in
those
of
old
22
However
you
have
utterly
rejected
us
You
remain
intensely
angry
with
us
1
In
the
30th
year
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
fourth
month
while
I
was
among
the
exiled
people
by
the
river
Chebar
the
heavens
were
opened
and
I
began
to
see
visions
of
God
2
On
the
fifth
day
of
the
month—that
is
in
the
fifth
year
of
the
exile
of
King
Jehoiachin—
3
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Ezekiel
son
of
Buzi
the
priest
by
the
river
Chebar
in
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
There
the
hand
of
Jehovah
came
upon
him
4
As
I
was
looking
I
saw
a
tempestuous
wind
coming
from
the
north
and
there
was
a
huge
cloud
and
flashing
fire
surrounded
by
a
bright
light
and
from
the
midst
of
the
fire
was
something
that
looked
like
electrum
5
Within
it
were
what
looked
like
four
living
creatures
and
the
appearance
of
each
one
was
like
that
of
a
human
6
Each
one
had
four
faces
and
four
wings
7
Their
feet
were
straight
and
the
soles
of
their
feet
were
like
those
of
a
calf
and
they
were
shining
like
the
glow
of
burnished
copper
8
They
had
human
hands
under
their
wings
on
all
four
sides
and
the
four
of
them
had
faces
and
wings
9
Their
wings
were
touching
one
another
They
would
not
turn
when
they
went
they
would
each
go
straight
forward
10
Their
faces
had
this
appearance
Each
of
the
four
had
a
mans
face
with
a
lions
face
on
the
right
a
bulls
face
on
the
left
and
each
of
the
four
had
an
eagles
face
11
That
is
how
their
faces
were
Their
wings
were
spread
out
above
them
Each
had
two
wings
that
were
touching
one
another
and
two
wings
covering
their
bodies
12
They
would
each
go
straight
forward
going
wherever
the
spirit
would
incline
them
to
go
They
would
not
turn
as
they
went
13
And
the
living
creatures
had
the
appearance
of
burning
coals
of
fire
and
something
that
looked
like
torches
of
bright
fire
was
moving
back
and
forth
between
the
living
creatures
and
lightning
was
flashing
out
from
the
fire
14
And
when
the
living
creatures
would
go
forth
and
return
their
movement
had
the
appearance
of
flashes
of
lightning
15
As
I
was
watching
the
living
creatures
I
saw
one
wheel
on
the
earth
beside
each
of
the
living
creatures
with
four
faces
16
The
wheels
and
their
structure
appeared
to
glow
like
chrysolite
and
the
four
of
them
looked
alike
Their
appearance
and
structure
looked
as
though
a
wheel
were
within
a
wheel
17
When
they
moved
they
could
go
in
any
of
the
four
directions
without
turning
as
they
went
18
Their
rims
were
so
high
that
they
inspired
awe
and
the
rims
of
all
four
were
full
of
eyes
all
around
19
Whenever
the
living
creatures
moved
the
wheels
would
move
along
with
them
and
when
the
living
creatures
were
lifted
up
from
the
earth
the
wheels
would
also
be
lifted
up
20
They
would
go
where
the
spirit
inclined
them
to
go
wherever
the
spirit
went
The
wheels
would
be
lifted
up
together
with
them
for
the
spirit
operating
on
the
living
creatures
was
also
in
the
wheels
21
When
they
moved
these
would
move
and
when
they
stood
still
these
would
stand
still
and
when
they
were
lifted
up
from
the
earth
the
wheels
would
be
lifted
up
together
with
them
for
the
spirit
operating
on
the
living
creatures
was
also
in
the
wheels
22
Over
the
heads
of
the
living
creatures
was
the
likeness
of
an
expanse
that
sparkled
like
awesome
ice
stretched
out
above
their
heads
23
Under
the
expanse
their
wings
were
straight
one
to
the
other
Each
one
had
two
wings
for
covering
one
side
of
their
bodies
and
two
for
covering
the
other
side
24
When
I
heard
the
sound
of
their
wings
it
was
like
a
sound
of
rushing
waters
like
the
sound
of
the
Almighty
When
they
moved
it
was
like
the
sound
of
an
army
When
they
stood
still
they
would
let
their
wings
down
25
There
was
a
voice
above
the
expanse
over
their
heads
When
they
stood
still
they
would
let
their
wings
down
26
Above
the
expanse
that
was
over
their
heads
was
what
looked
like
a
sapphire
stone
and
it
resembled
a
throne
Sitting
on
the
throne
up
above
was
someone
whose
appearance
resembled
that
of
a
human
27
I
saw
something
glowing
like
electrum
that
was
like
a
fire
radiating
from
what
appeared
to
be
his
waist
and
upward
and
from
his
waist
down
I
saw
something
that
resembled
fire
There
was
a
brilliance
all
around
him
28
like
that
of
a
rainbow
in
a
cloud
on
a
rainy
day
That
was
how
the
surrounding
brilliant
light
appeared
It
was
like
the
appearance
of
the
glory
of
Jehovah
When
I
saw
it
I
fell
facedown
and
began
to
hear
the
voice
of
someone
speaking
1
He
then
said
to
me
Son
of
man
stand
up
on
your
feet
that
I
may
speak
with
you
2
When
he
spoke
to
me
spirit
came
into
me
and
made
me
stand
up
on
my
feet
so
that
I
could
hear
the
One
speaking
to
me
3
He
went
on
to
say
to
me
Son
of
man
I
am
sending
you
to
the
people
of
Israel
to
rebellious
nations
that
have
rebelled
against
me
They
and
their
forefathers
have
transgressed
against
me
down
to
this
very
day
4
I
am
sending
you
to
sons
who
are
defiant
and
hardhearted
and
you
must
say
to
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
5
As
for
them
whether
they
listen
or
refuse
to
listen—for
they
are
a
rebellious
house—they
will
certainly
know
that
a
prophet
was
among
them
6
But
you
son
of
man
do
not
be
afraid
of
them
and
do
not
be
afraid
of
their
words
although
you
are
surrounded
by
briars
and
thorns
and
are
dwelling
among
scorpions
Do
not
be
afraid
of
their
words
and
do
not
be
terrified
by
their
faces
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
7
You
must
speak
my
words
to
them
whether
they
listen
or
not
for
they
are
a
rebellious
people
8
But
you
son
of
man
listen
to
what
I
am
telling
you
Do
not
become
rebellious
like
this
rebellious
house
Open
your
mouth
and
eat
what
I
am
giving
you
9
When
I
looked
I
saw
a
hand
stretched
out
to
me
and
in
it
I
saw
a
written
scroll
10
When
he
spread
it
out
before
me
it
had
writing
on
both
front
and
back
Dirges
and
mourning
and
wailing
were
written
on
it
1
Then
he
said
to
me
Son
of
man
eat
what
is
before
you
Eat
this
scroll
and
go
speak
to
the
house
of
Israel
2
So
I
opened
my
mouth
and
he
made
me
eat
this
scroll
3
He
went
on
to
say
to
me
Son
of
man
eat
this
scroll
that
I
am
giving
you
and
fill
your
stomach
with
it
So
I
began
to
eat
it
and
it
was
as
sweet
as
honey
in
my
mouth
4
He
said
to
me
Son
of
man
go
in
among
the
house
of
Israel
and
speak
my
words
to
them
5
For
you
are
not
being
sent
to
a
people
who
speak
an
unintelligible
language
or
an
unknown
tongue
but
to
the
house
of
Israel
6
You
are
not
being
sent
to
many
peoples
speaking
an
unintelligible
language
or
an
unknown
tongue
whose
words
you
cannot
understand
If
I
would
send
you
to
them
they
would
listen
to
you
7
But
the
house
of
Israel
will
refuse
to
listen
to
you
for
they
do
not
want
to
listen
to
me
All
those
of
the
house
of
Israel
are
hardheaded
and
hardhearted
8
Look
I
have
made
your
face
exactly
as
hard
as
their
faces
and
your
forehead
exactly
as
hard
as
their
foreheads
9
I
have
made
your
forehead
like
a
diamond
harder
than
flint
Do
not
be
afraid
of
them
or
be
terrified
by
their
faces
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
10
He
went
on
to
say
to
me
Son
of
man
take
to
heart
and
listen
to
all
my
words
that
I
speak
to
you
11
Go
in
among
the
exiles
of
your
people
and
speak
to
them
Tell
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says

whether
they
listen
or
refuse
to
listen
12
A
spirit
then
carried
me
along
and
I
heard
behind
me
a
great
rumbling
sound
that
said
May
the
glory
of
Jehovah
be
praised
from
his
place
13
There
was
the
sound
of
the
wings
of
the
living
creatures
as
they
were
brushing
against
one
another
and
the
sound
of
the
wheels
next
to
them
and
the
sound
of
a
great
rumbling
14
And
the
spirit
carried
me
along
and
took
me
and
I
went
in
bitterness
and
in
the
rage
of
my
spirit
and
the
hand
of
Jehovah
rested
strongly
on
me
15
So
I
went
to
the
exiled
people
at
Tel-abib
who
were
dwelling
by
the
river
Chebar
and
I
stayed
there
where
they
were
dwelling
and
in
a
dazed
condition
I
stayed
among
them
for
seven
days
16
At
the
end
of
seven
days
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
17
Son
of
man
I
have
appointed
you
as
a
watchman
to
the
house
of
Israel
and
when
you
hear
a
word
from
my
mouth
you
must
warn
them
from
me
18
When
I
say
to
someone
wicked
You
will
surely
die

but
you
do
not
warn
him
and
you
fail
to
speak
in
order
to
warn
the
wicked
one
to
turn
from
his
wicked
course
so
that
he
may
stay
alive
he
will
die
for
his
error
because
he
is
wicked
but
I
will
ask
his
blood
back
from
you
19
But
if
you
warn
someone
wicked
and
he
does
not
turn
back
from
his
wickedness
and
from
his
wicked
course
he
will
die
for
his
error
but
you
will
certainly
save
your
own
life
20
But
when
someone
righteous
abandons
his
righteousness
and
does
what
is
wrong
I
will
put
a
stumbling
block
before
him
and
he
will
die
If
you
did
not
warn
him
he
will
die
for
his
sin
and
his
righteous
acts
will
not
be
remembered
but
I
will
ask
his
blood
back
from
you
21
But
if
you
have
warned
the
righteous
one
not
to
sin
and
he
does
not
sin
he
will
surely
keep
alive
because
he
was
warned
and
you
will
have
saved
your
own
life
22
The
hand
of
Jehovah
came
upon
me
there
and
he
said
to
me
Get
up
go
to
the
valley
plain
and
I
will
speak
with
you
there
23
So
I
got
up
and
went
to
the
valley
plain
and
look
the
glory
of
Jehovah
was
there
like
the
glory
that
I
saw
by
the
river
Chebar
and
I
fell
facedown
24
Then
spirit
entered
into
me
and
made
me
stand
up
on
my
feet
and
he
spoke
to
me
and
said
Go
shut
yourself
inside
your
house
25
As
for
you
son
of
man
they
will
put
ropes
on
you
and
tie
you
with
them
so
that
you
cannot
go
out
among
them
26
And
I
will
make
your
tongue
stick
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
and
you
will
become
mute
unable
to
reprove
them
because
they
are
a
rebellious
house
27
But
when
I
speak
with
you
I
will
open
your
mouth
and
you
must
say
to
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Let
the
one
listening
listen
and
let
the
one
refusing
to
listen
refuse
because
they
are
a
rebellious
house
1
And
you
son
of
man
take
a
brick
and
put
it
in
front
of
you
Engrave
on
it
a
city—Jerusalem
2
Lay
siege
to
it
build
a
siege
wall
against
it
raise
up
a
siege
rampart
against
it
set
up
camps
against
it
and
surround
it
with
battering
rams
3
Take
an
iron
griddle
and
place
it
as
an
iron
wall
between
you
and
the
city
Then
set
your
face
against
it
and
it
will
be
under
siege
you
are
to
besiege
it
This
is
a
sign
to
the
house
of
Israel
4
Then
you
should
lie
on
your
left
side
and
lay
the
guilt
of
the
house
of
Israel
on
yourself
You
will
carry
their
guilt
for
the
number
of
days
that
you
lie
on
your
side
5
And
I
will
impose
on
you
390
days
corresponding
to
the
years
of
their
guilt
and
you
will
carry
the
guilt
of
the
house
of
Israel
6
And
you
must
complete
them
Then
for
a
second
time
you
will
lie
down
on
your
right
side
and
you
will
carry
the
guilt
of
the
house
of
Judah
for
40
days
A
day
for
a
year
a
day
for
a
year
is
what
I
have
given
you
7
And
you
will
turn
your
face
toward
the
siege
of
Jerusalem
with
your
arm
bared
and
you
must
prophesy
against
it
8
Look
I
will
tie
you
with
ropes
so
that
you
cannot
turn
from
your
one
side
to
your
other
side
until
you
have
completed
the
days
of
your
siege
9
And
you
should
take
wheat
barley
broad
beans
lentils
millet
and
spelt
and
put
them
in
one
container
and
make
them
into
bread
for
yourself
For
the
number
of
the
days
that
you
are
lying
on
your
side
390
days
you
will
eat
it
10
You
will
weigh
out
and
eat
20
shekels
of
food
per
day
You
will
eat
it
at
set
times
11
And
you
will
drink
water
by
measure
a
sixth
of
a
hin
You
will
drink
it
at
set
times
12
You
will
eat
it
as
you
would
a
round
barley
loaf
you
will
bake
it
before
their
eyes
using
dried
human
excrement
as
fuel
13
Jehovah
went
on
to
say
This
is
how
the
Israelites
will
eat
their
bread—unclean—among
the
nations
where
I
will
disperse
them
14
I
then
said
Not
that
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
From
my
youth
until
now
I
have
not
been
defiled
by
eating
meat
from
an
animal
found
dead
or
a
torn
animal
and
no
unclean
meat
has
entered
my
mouth
15
So
he
said
to
me
All
right
I
will
allow
you
to
use
cattle
manure
instead
of
human
excrement
and
you
will
bake
your
bread
over
it
16
He
then
said
to
me
Son
of
man
here
I
am
cutting
off
your
food
supply
in
Jerusalem
and
with
great
anxiety
they
will
eat
their
bread
ration
by
weight
and
in
horror
they
will
drink
their
water
ration
by
measure
17
This
will
happen
so
that
lacking
bread
and
water
they
may
look
in
shock
at
one
another
and
waste
away
because
of
their
error
1
As
for
you
son
of
man
take
a
sharp
sword
for
yourself
to
use
as
a
barbers
razor
Shave
your
head
and
your
beard
and
then
take
scales
to
weigh
and
divide
the
hair
into
portions
2
You
will
burn
a
third
of
it
in
the
fire
inside
the
city
when
the
days
of
the
siege
are
completed
Then
you
will
take
another
third
and
strike
it
with
the
sword
all
around
the
city
and
the
last
third
you
will
scatter
to
the
wind
and
I
will
draw
a
sword
to
chase
after
them
3
You
must
also
take
a
few
strands
of
them
and
wrap
them
up
in
the
folds
of
your
garment
4
And
take
some
more
of
them
and
throw
them
into
the
fire
and
incinerate
them
From
this
a
fire
will
spread
to
all
the
house
of
Israel
5
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
This
is
Jerusalem
I
have
set
her
in
the
middle
of
the
nations
with
lands
all
around
her
6
But
she
has
rebelled
against
my
judicial
decisions
and
my
statutes
acting
more
wickedly
than
the
nations
and
the
lands
all
around
her
For
they
have
rejected
my
judicial
decisions
and
they
did
not
walk
in
my
statutes
7
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
you
were
more
troublesome
than
the
nations
all
around
you
and
you
did
not
walk
in
my
statutes
or
carry
out
my
judicial
decisions
but
instead
you
followed
the
judicial
decisions
of
the
nations
all
around
you
8
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
against
you
O
city
and
I
myself
will
execute
judgment
in
your
midst
before
the
eyes
of
the
nations
9
I
will
do
in
you
what
I
have
never
done
before
and
the
likes
of
which
I
will
not
do
again
because
of
all
your
detestable
practices
10
So
fathers
among
you
will
eat
their
sons
and
sons
will
eat
their
fathers
and
I
will
execute
judgment
among
you
and
scatter
all
the
rest
of
you
in
every
direction
11
Therefore
as
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
because
it
was
my
sanctuary
that
you
defiled
with
all
your
disgusting
idols
and
with
all
your
detestable
practices
I
will
also
reject
you
my
eye
will
not
feel
sorry
and
I
will
show
no
compassion
12
A
third
of
you
will
die
by
the
pestilence
or
perish
in
your
midst
by
famine
Another
third
will
fall
all
around
you
by
the
sword
And
I
will
scatter
the
last
third
in
every
direction
and
I
will
draw
a
sword
to
chase
after
them
13
Then
my
anger
will
come
to
an
end
and
my
wrath
against
them
will
subside
and
I
will
be
satisfied
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
Jehovah
have
spoken
in
my
insistence
on
exclusive
devotion
when
I
have
finished
unleashing
my
wrath
against
them
14
I
will
make
you
a
devastated
place
and
an
object
of
reproach
among
the
surrounding
nations
and
in
the
eyes
of
everyone
passing
by
15
You
will
become
an
object
of
reproach
and
scorn
a
warning
example
and
a
horror
to
the
nations
around
you
when
I
execute
judgment
on
you
in
anger
and
in
wrath
and
with
furious
punishments
I
Jehovah
have
spoken
16
I
will
send
against
them
the
deadly
arrows
of
famine
to
destroy
them
The
arrows
that
I
send
will
bring
you
to
ruin
I
will
make
the
famine
worse
for
you
by
cutting
off
your
food
supply
17
I
will
send
against
you
famine
and
vicious
wild
beasts
and
they
will
bereave
you
of
children
Pestilence
and
bloodshed
will
overwhelm
you
and
I
will
bring
a
sword
against
you
I
Jehovah
have
spoken
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
turn
your
face
toward
the
mountains
of
Israel
and
prophesy
against
them
3
You
must
say
O
mountains
of
Israel
hear
the
word
of
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
to
the
mountains
to
the
hills
to
the
streams
and
to
the
valleys
Look
I
will
bring
a
sword
against
you
and
I
will
destroy
your
high
places
4
Your
altars
will
be
demolished
your
incense
stands
will
be
broken
and
I
will
throw
your
slain
ones
down
before
your
disgusting
idols
5
I
will
throw
the
carcasses
of
the
people
of
Israel
before
their
disgusting
idols
and
I
will
scatter
your
bones
all
around
your
altars
6
In
all
the
places
where
you
dwell
the
cities
will
be
devastated
and
the
high
places
will
be
demolished
and
will
lie
devastated
Your
altars
will
be
demolished
and
shattered
your
disgusting
idols
will
perish
your
incense
stands
will
be
cut
down
and
your
works
will
be
wiped
out
7
And
those
slain
will
fall
in
your
midst
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
8
But
I
will
leave
a
remnant
for
some
of
you
will
escape
the
sword
among
the
nations
when
you
are
scattered
throughout
the
lands
9
And
those
who
escape
will
remember
me
among
the
nations
where
they
are
taken
captive
They
will
realize
that
I
was
brokenhearted
over
their
unfaithful
heart
that
turned
away
from
me
and
at
their
eyes
that
are
lusting
after
their
disgusting
idols
They
will
be
ashamed
of
and
loathe
all
the
evil
and
detestable
things
they
have
done
10
They
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
and
that
my
threats
to
bring
this
calamity
on
them
were
not
empty
11
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Clap
your
hands
and
stamp
your
foot
and
bemoan
all
the
evil
and
detestable
things
done
by
the
house
of
Israel
for
they
will
fall
by
the
sword
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
12
The
one
far
away
will
die
by
pestilence
the
one
nearby
will
fall
by
the
sword
and
whoever
escapes
these
and
is
left
remaining
will
die
by
famine
and
I
will
fully
unleash
my
wrath
against
them
13
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
their
slain
lie
among
their
disgusting
idols
all
around
their
altars
on
every
high
hill
on
all
the
mountaintops
under
every
luxuriant
tree
and
under
the
branches
of
big
trees
where
they
have
made
fragrant
offerings
to
appease
all
their
disgusting
idols
14
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand
against
them
and
make
the
land
desolate
and
all
their
dwelling
places
will
become
more
desolate
than
the
wilderness
near
Diblah
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
As
for
you
son
of
man
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
to
the
land
of
Israel
An
end
The
end
has
come
upon
the
four
corners
of
the
land
3
The
end
is
now
upon
you
and
I
will
unleash
my
anger
against
you
and
I
will
judge
you
according
to
your
ways
and
call
you
to
account
for
all
your
detestable
deeds
4
My
eye
will
not
feel
sorry
for
you
nor
will
I
feel
compassion
for
I
will
bring
upon
you
the
results
of
your
own
ways
and
you
will
suffer
the
consequences
of
your
detestable
deeds
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
5
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Look
A
calamity
a
unique
calamity
is
coming
6
An
end
is
coming
the
end
will
come
it
will
rouse
itself
against
you
Look
It
is
coming
7
Your
turn
has
come
you
who
inhabit
the
land
The
time
is
coming
the
day
is
near
There
is
confusion
and
not
joyful
shouting
on
the
mountains
8
Very
soon
I
will
pour
out
my
rage
on
you
and
I
will
fully
unleash
my
anger
against
you
and
I
will
judge
you
according
to
your
ways
and
call
you
to
account
for
all
your
detestable
deeds
9
My
eye
will
not
feel
sorry
nor
will
I
feel
compassion
I
will
bring
on
you
the
results
of
your
ways
and
you
will
suffer
the
consequences
of
your
own
detestable
deeds
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
Jehovah
am
striking
you
10
Look
the
day
Look
it
is
coming
Your
turn
has
come
the
rod
has
blossomed
and
presumptuousness
has
sprouted
11
Violence
has
grown
into
a
rod
of
wickedness
Neither
they
nor
their
wealth
nor
their
crowds
nor
their
prominence
will
survive
12
The
time
will
come
the
day
will
arrive
Let
the
buyer
not
rejoice
and
let
the
seller
not
mourn
for
there
is
wrath
against
their
whole
crowd
13
For
the
seller
will
not
return
to
what
was
sold
even
if
his
life
is
spared
for
the
vision
is
against
the
entire
multitude
No
one
will
return
and
because
of
his
error
no
one
will
preserve
his
life
14
They
have
blown
the
trumpet
and
everyone
is
ready
but
no
one
is
going
to
the
battle
because
my
wrath
is
against
the
whole
multitude
15
The
sword
is
outside
and
the
pestilence
and
the
famine
are
inside
Whoever
is
in
the
field
will
die
by
the
sword
and
famine
and
pestilence
will
consume
those
in
the
city
16
Their
survivors
who
manage
to
escape
will
go
to
the
mountains
and
like
the
doves
of
the
valleys
each
one
will
moan
over
his
error
17
All
their
hands
will
hang
limp
and
all
their
knees
will
drip
with
water
18
They
have
put
on
sackcloth
and
shuddering
has
seized
them
Everyone
will
be
put
to
shame
and
every
head
will
be
bald
19
They
will
throw
their
silver
into
the
streets
and
their
gold
will
become
abhorrent
to
them
Neither
their
silver
nor
their
gold
will
be
able
to
save
them
in
the
day
of
Jehovahs
fury
They
will
not
be
satisfied
nor
will
they
fill
their
stomachs
for
it
has
become
a
stumbling
block
causing
their
error
20
They
took
pride
in
the
beauty
of
their
ornaments
and
they
made
with
them
their
detestable
images
their
disgusting
idols
That
is
why
I
will
make
it
an
abhorrent
thing
to
them
21
I
will
give
it
into
the
hand
of
the
foreigners
for
plunder
and
to
the
wicked
ones
of
the
earth
for
spoil
and
they
will
profane
it
22
I
will
turn
my
face
away
from
them
and
they
will
profane
my
concealed
place
and
robbers
will
enter
it
and
profane
it
23
Make
the
chain
for
the
land
is
full
of
bloodstained
judgment
and
the
city
is
full
of
violence
24
I
will
bring
in
the
worst
of
the
nations
and
they
will
take
possession
of
their
houses
and
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
pride
of
the
strong
ones
and
their
sanctuaries
will
be
profaned
25
When
their
anguish
comes
they
will
seek
peace
but
there
will
be
none
26
There
will
come
disaster
upon
disaster
and
one
report
after
another
and
people
will
seek
a
vision
from
a
prophet
but
the
law
will
perish
from
a
priest
and
advice
from
the
elders
27
The
king
will
go
into
mourning
and
the
chieftain
will
be
clothed
with
despair
and
the
hands
of
the
people
of
the
land
will
tremble
in
terror
I
will
treat
them
according
to
their
ways
and
I
will
judge
them
as
they
have
judged
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
1
And
in
the
sixth
year
in
the
sixth
month
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
when
I
was
sitting
in
my
house
and
the
elders
of
Judah
were
sitting
before
me
the
hand
of
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
took
hold
of
me
there
2
As
I
watched
I
saw
a
form
similar
to
the
appearance
of
fire
there
was
fire
below
what
appeared
to
be
his
waist
and
from
his
waist
upward
his
appearance
was
bright
like
the
glow
of
electrum
3
Then
he
stretched
out
what
appeared
to
be
a
hand
and
took
me
by
a
tuft
of
hair
of
my
head
and
a
spirit
carried
me
between
the
earth
and
the
heavens
and
brought
me
to
Jerusalem
by
means
of
the
visions
from
God
to
the
entrance
of
the
inner
gate
that
faces
north
where
the
idolatrous
symbol
of
jealousy
that
incites
jealousy
stood
4
And
look
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
was
there
like
the
appearance
that
I
had
seen
in
the
valley
plain
5
He
then
said
to
me
Son
of
man
please
raise
your
eyes
toward
the
north
So
I
raised
my
eyes
toward
the
north
and
there
north
of
the
gate
of
the
altar
was
this
symbol
of
jealousy
in
the
entryway
6
And
he
said
to
me
Son
of
man
do
you
see
what
terrible
detestable
things
the
house
of
Israel
is
doing
here
things
that
make
me
go
far
away
from
my
sanctuary
But
you
will
see
detestable
things
that
are
even
more
terrible
7
Then
he
brought
me
to
the
entrance
of
the
courtyard
and
when
I
looked
I
saw
a
hole
in
the
wall
8
He
said
to
me
Son
of
man
please
bore
through
the
wall
So
I
bored
through
the
wall
and
I
saw
an
entryway
9
He
said
to
me
Go
in
and
see
the
evil
detestable
things
that
they
are
doing
here
10
So
I
went
in
and
looked
and
I
saw
all
sorts
of
images
of
creeping
things
and
loathsome
beasts
and
all
the
disgusting
idols
of
the
house
of
Israel
they
were
carved
on
the
wall
all
around
11
And
70
of
the
elders
of
the
house
of
Israel
were
standing
before
them
with
Jaazaniah
the
son
of
Shaphan
standing
among
them
Each
one
had
his
censer
in
his
hand
and
the
perfumed
cloud
of
incense
was
ascending
12
He
said
to
me
Son
of
man
do
you
see
what
the
elders
of
the
house
of
Israel
are
doing
in
the
darkness
each
one
in
the
inner
rooms
where
his
idols
are
displayed
For
they
are
saying
Jehovah
is
not
seeing
us
Jehovah
has
left
the
land
13
And
he
went
on
to
say
to
me
You
will
see
detestable
things
that
are
even
more
terrible
that
they
are
doing
14
So
he
brought
me
to
the
entrance
of
the
north
gate
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
there
I
saw
women
sitting
and
weeping
over
the
god
Tammuz
15
And
he
further
said
to
me
Do
you
see
this
O
son
of
man
You
will
see
detestable
things
that
are
even
more
terrible
than
these
16
So
he
brought
me
to
the
inner
courtyard
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
There
at
the
entrance
of
the
temple
of
Jehovah
between
the
porch
and
the
altar
were
about
25
men
with
their
backs
to
the
temple
of
Jehovah
and
their
faces
to
the
east
they
were
bowing
down
to
the
sun
in
the
east
17
He
said
to
me
Son
of
man
do
you
see
this
Is
it
a
trivial
thing
for
the
house
of
Judah
to
do
these
detestable
things
to
fill
the
land
with
violence
and
keep
offending
me
Here
they
are
thrusting
out
the
branch
to
my
nose
18
So
I
will
act
in
rage
My
eye
will
not
feel
sorry
nor
will
I
feel
compassion
Even
though
they
cry
out
loudly
in
my
ears
I
will
not
hear
them
1
He
then
called
out
in
my
ears
with
a
loud
voice
saying
Summon
those
who
will
bring
punishment
on
the
city
each
one
with
his
weapon
for
destruction
in
his
hand
2
I
saw
six
men
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
upper
gate
that
faces
north
each
with
his
weapon
for
smashing
in
his
hand
and
there
was
one
man
among
them
clothed
in
linen
with
a
secretarys
inkhorn
at
his
waist
and
they
came
in
and
stood
beside
the
copper
altar
3
Then
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
rose
from
where
it
had
rested
above
the
cherubs
and
moved
to
the
threshold
of
the
doorway
of
the
house
and
he
began
calling
out
to
the
man
who
was
clothed
in
linen
at
whose
waist
was
the
secretarys
inkhorn
4
Jehovah
said
to
him
Go
through
the
city
through
Jerusalem
and
put
a
mark
on
the
foreheads
of
the
men
who
are
sighing
and
groaning
over
all
the
detestable
things
that
are
being
done
in
the
city
5
And
to
the
others
he
said
in
my
hearing
Go
through
the
city
after
him
and
strike
Do
not
let
your
eye
feel
sorry
and
do
not
feel
any
compassion
6
Old
man
young
man
virgin
little
child
and
women
you
should
kill
off
completely
But
do
not
go
near
to
any
man
on
whom
there
is
the
mark
You
should
start
from
my
sanctuary
So
they
started
with
the
elders
who
were
in
front
of
the
house
7
Then
he
said
to
them
Defile
the
house
and
fill
the
courtyards
with
the
slain
Go
So
they
went
out
and
struck
down
people
in
the
city
8
While
they
were
striking
them
down
I
alone
was
left
and
I
fell
facedown
and
cried
out
Alas
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Are
you
going
to
destroy
all
the
remaining
ones
of
Israel
while
you
pour
out
your
rage
on
Jerusalem
9
So
he
said
to
me
The
error
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
Judah
is
very
very
great
The
land
is
filled
with
bloodshed
and
the
city
is
full
of
corruption
For
they
say
Jehovah
has
left
the
land
and
Jehovah
is
not
seeing
10
But
as
for
me
my
eye
will
not
feel
sorry
nor
will
I
show
compassion
The
consequences
of
their
way
I
will
bring
down
on
their
own
head
11
Then
I
saw
the
man
clothed
in
linen
with
the
inkhorn
at
his
waist
bringing
back
word
saying
I
have
done
just
as
you
have
commanded
me
1
As
I
was
watching
I
saw
above
the
expanse
that
was
over
the
heads
of
the
cherubs
something
like
a
sapphire
stone
appearing
above
them
and
its
appearance
resembled
a
throne
2
Then
he
said
to
the
man
clothed
in
linen
Enter
between
the
wheelwork
under
the
cherubs
and
fill
both
your
hands
with
burning
coals
from
between
the
cherubs
and
toss
them
over
the
city
So
he
entered
as
I
watched
3
The
cherubs
were
standing
to
the
right
of
the
house
when
the
man
entered
and
the
cloud
filled
the
inner
courtyard
4
And
the
glory
of
Jehovah
rose
up
from
the
cherubs
to
the
threshold
of
the
doorway
of
the
house
and
the
house
gradually
became
filled
with
the
cloud
and
the
courtyard
was
full
of
the
brightness
of
the
glory
of
Jehovah
5
And
the
sound
of
the
wings
of
the
cherubs
could
be
heard
in
the
outer
courtyard
like
the
sound
of
God
Almighty
when
he
speaks
6
Then
he
commanded
the
man
clothed
in
linen
Take
fire
from
between
the
wheelwork
from
between
the
cherubs

and
he
entered
and
stood
beside
the
wheel
7
Then
one
of
the
cherubs
stretched
his
hand
out
toward
the
fire
that
was
between
the
cherubs
He
took
some
and
put
it
into
both
hands
of
the
one
clothed
in
linen
who
now
took
it
and
went
out
8
The
cherubs
had
what
looked
like
the
form
of
human
hands
under
their
wings
9
As
I
was
watching
I
saw
four
wheels
beside
the
cherubs
one
wheel
beside
each
cherub
and
the
wheels
appeared
to
glow
like
chrysolite
stone
10
As
for
their
appearance
the
four
of
them
were
alike
looking
as
though
a
wheel
were
within
a
wheel
11
When
they
moved
they
could
go
in
any
of
the
four
directions
without
turning
because
they
would
go
to
the
place
where
the
head
would
face
without
turning
12
Their
entire
bodies
their
backs
their
hands
their
wings
and
the
wheels
the
wheels
of
all
four
of
them
were
full
of
eyes
all
around
13
As
regards
the
wheels
I
heard
a
voice
that
called
to
them
Wheelwork
14
Each
one
had
four
faces
The
first
face
was
the
face
of
the
cherub
the
second
face
was
the
face
of
a
man
the
third
was
the
face
of
a
lion
and
the
fourth
was
the
face
of
an
eagle
15
And
the
cherubs
would
rise—they
were
the
same
living
creatures
that
I
had
seen
at
the
river
Chebar—
16
and
when
the
cherubs
moved
the
wheels
would
move
alongside
them
and
when
the
cherubs
lifted
up
their
wings
to
be
high
above
the
earth
the
wheels
would
not
turn
or
move
from
their
side
17
When
these
stood
still
they
would
stand
still
and
when
these
rose
they
would
rise
with
them
for
the
spirit
operating
on
the
living
creatures
was
in
them
18
Then
the
glory
of
Jehovah
departed
from
over
the
threshold
of
the
doorway
of
the
house
and
stood
still
over
the
cherubs
19
The
cherubs
now
lifted
up
their
wings
and
rose
from
the
earth
as
I
watched
The
wheels
were
also
alongside
them
when
they
departed
They
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
the
eastern
gate
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
and
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
was
above
them
20
These
were
the
living
creatures
that
I
had
seen
under
the
God
of
Israel
at
the
river
Chebar
so
I
came
to
know
that
they
were
cherubs
21
All
four
had
four
faces
four
wings
and
what
appeared
to
be
human
hands
under
their
wings
22
And
the
appearances
of
their
faces
were
like
the
faces
I
had
seen
by
the
river
Chebar
They
would
each
go
straight
forward
1
And
a
spirit
lifted
me
up
and
brought
me
to
the
eastern
gate
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
the
gate
that
faces
east
There
at
the
entrance
of
the
gate
I
saw
25
men
and
among
them
were
Jaazaniah
the
son
of
Azzur
and
Pelatiah
the
son
of
Benaiah
princes
of
the
people
2
Then
He
said
to
me
Son
of
man
these
are
the
men
who
are
scheming
evil
and
giving
wicked
advice
in
this
city
3
They
are
saying
Is
it
not
the
time
for
building
houses
The
city
is
the
cooking
pot
and
we
are
the
flesh
4
So
prophesy
against
them
Prophesy
son
of
man
5
Then
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
came
upon
me
and
he
said
to
me
Say
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
What
you
have
said
is
correct
O
house
of
Israel
and
I
know
what
you
are
thinking
6
You
have
caused
many
to
die
in
this
city
and
you
have
filled
her
streets
with
the
dead
7
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
The
dead
bodies
that
you
have
strewn
about
the
city
are
the
flesh
and
the
city
is
the
cooking
pot
But
you
yourselves
will
be
taken
out
of
it
8
A
sword
you
have
feared
and
a
sword
I
will
bring
against
you

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
9
I
will
bring
you
out
of
her
and
give
you
into
the
hand
of
foreigners
and
execute
judgment
on
you
10
You
will
fall
by
the
sword
I
will
judge
you
at
the
border
of
Israel
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
11
The
city
will
not
be
a
cooking
pot
for
you
and
you
will
not
be
the
flesh
within
it
I
will
judge
you
at
the
border
of
Israel
12
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
For
you
did
not
walk
in
my
regulations
and
carry
out
my
judgments
but
you
have
acted
in
harmony
with
the
judgments
of
the
nations
around
you
13
As
soon
as
I
prophesied
Pelatiah
the
son
of
Benaiah
died
and
I
fell
facedown
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
Alas
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Are
you
going
to
exterminate
the
remaining
ones
of
Israel
14
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
15
Son
of
man
your
brothers
those
of
your
brothers
with
the
right
of
repurchase
along
with
the
entire
house
of
Israel
have
been
told
by
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
Keep
far
away
from
Jehovah
The
land
is
ours
it
has
been
given
to
us
as
a
possession
16
Therefore
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Although
I
have
removed
them
far
away
among
the
nations
and
I
have
scattered
them
among
the
lands
for
a
little
while
I
will
become
a
sanctuary
for
them
in
the
lands
to
which
they
have
gone
17
Therefore
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
also
collect
you
from
the
peoples
and
gather
you
from
the
lands
to
which
you
have
been
scattered
and
I
will
give
you
the
land
of
Israel
18
And
they
will
return
there
and
remove
from
it
all
its
disgusting
things
and
detestable
practices
19
And
I
will
give
them
a
unified
heart
and
I
will
put
a
new
spirit
in
them
and
I
will
remove
the
heart
of
stone
from
their
bodies
and
give
them
a
heart
of
flesh
20
in
order
that
they
may
walk
in
my
statutes
and
observe
my
judgments
and
obey
them
Then
they
will
be
my
people
and
I
will
be
their
God
21
But
as
for
those
whose
hearts
are
set
to
continue
in
their
disgusting
things
and
their
detestable
practices
I
will
bring
the
consequences
of
their
way
upon
their
head

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
22
The
cherubs
now
lifted
up
their
wings
and
the
wheels
were
close
to
them
and
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
was
above
them
23
Then
the
glory
of
Jehovah
ascended
from
the
city
and
stopped
over
the
mountain
to
the
east
of
the
city
24
A
spirit
then
lifted
me
up—through
a
vision
by
the
spirit
of
God—and
brought
me
to
the
exiled
people
in
Chaldea
Then
the
vision
that
I
had
seen
left
me
25
And
I
began
to
tell
the
exiled
people
all
the
things
that
Jehovah
had
shown
me
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
you
are
living
in
a
rebellious
house
They
have
eyes
to
see
but
they
do
not
see
and
ears
to
hear
but
they
do
not
hear
for
they
are
a
rebellious
house
3
As
for
you
son
of
man
prepare
for
yourself
luggage
for
going
into
exile
Then
during
the
day
while
they
are
watching
you
must
go
into
exile
Go
into
exile
from
your
home
to
another
place
while
they
are
watching
Perhaps
they
will
take
notice
even
though
they
are
a
rebellious
house
4
Bring
out
your
luggage
packed
for
going
into
exile
during
the
day
while
they
are
watching
and
then
in
the
evening
while
they
are
watching
you
should
leave
like
someone
being
taken
into
exile
5
While
they
are
watching
bore
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
carry
your
belongings
out
through
it
6
While
they
are
watching
put
your
belongings
on
your
shoulder
and
carry
them
out
in
the
darkness
Cover
your
face
so
that
you
cannot
see
the
ground
for
I
am
making
you
a
sign
to
the
house
of
Israel
7
I
did
just
as
I
was
commanded
During
the
day
I
brought
out
my
luggage
as
luggage
for
going
into
exile
and
in
the
evening
I
bored
a
hole
through
the
wall
by
hand
And
when
it
was
dark
I
took
out
my
belongings
carrying
them
on
my
shoulder
right
before
their
eyes
8
In
the
morning
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
9
Son
of
man
did
not
the
house
of
Israel
the
rebellious
house
ask
you
What
are
you
doing
10
Tell
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
This
pronouncement
concerns
the
chieftain
in
Jerusalem
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
within
the
city
11
Say
I
am
a
sign
for
you
Just
as
I
have
done
that
is
what
will
be
done
to
them
They
will
go
into
exile
into
captivity
12
The
chieftain
who
is
among
them
will
carry
his
belongings
on
his
shoulder
and
leave
in
the
darkness
He
will
bore
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
carry
his
belongings
out
through
it
He
will
cover
his
face
so
that
he
cannot
see
the
ground
13
I
will
cast
my
net
over
him
and
he
will
be
caught
in
my
hunting
net
Then
I
will
bring
him
to
Babylon
to
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
but
he
will
not
see
it
and
there
he
will
die
14
And
all
those
around
him
his
helpers
and
his
troops
I
will
scatter
in
every
direction
and
I
will
draw
out
a
sword
to
chase
after
them
15
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
disperse
them
among
the
nations
and
I
scatter
them
among
the
lands
16
But
I
will
spare
a
few
of
them
from
the
sword
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
so
that
they
may
tell
about
all
their
detestable
practices
among
the
nations
where
they
will
go
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
17
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
18
Son
of
man
you
should
eat
your
bread
with
trembling
and
drink
your
water
with
agitation
and
anxiety
19
Say
to
the
people
of
the
land
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
in
the
land
of
Israel
They
will
eat
their
bread
with
anxiety
and
drink
their
water
with
horror
for
their
land
will
become
completely
desolate
because
of
the
violence
of
all
those
dwelling
in
it
20
The
inhabited
cities
will
be
devastated
and
the
land
will
become
a
wasteland
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
21
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
22
Son
of
man
what
is
this
proverb
that
you
have
in
Israel
that
says
The
days
go
by
and
every
vision
comes
to
nothing
23
Therefore
say
to
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
cause
this
saying
to
cease
and
they
will
no
more
use
it
as
a
proverb
in
Israel
But
tell
them
The
days
are
near
and
every
vision
will
take
place
24
For
there
will
no
longer
be
any
false
vision
or
flattering
divination
within
the
house
of
Israel
25
For
I
Jehovah
will
speak
Whatever
word
I
speak
will
be
done
without
any
more
delay
In
your
days
O
rebellious
house
I
will
say
the
word
and
carry
it
out

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
26
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
27
Son
of
man
this
is
what
the
people
of
Israel
are
saying
The
vision
that
he
sees
is
for
a
long
time
from
now
and
he
is
prophesying
about
the
distant
future
28
Therefore
say
to
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
None
of
my
words
will
be
delayed
whatever
I
say
will
be
done

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
prophesy
against
the
prophets
of
Israel
and
say
to
those
who
fabricate
their
own
prophecies
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
3
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Woe
to
the
stupid
prophets
who
follow
their
own
spirit
when
they
have
seen
nothing
4
O
Israel
your
prophets
have
become
like
foxes
among
the
ruins
5
You
will
not
go
to
the
broken
places
in
the
stone
walls
to
rebuild
them
for
the
house
of
Israel
so
that
Israel
may
keep
standing
in
the
battle
in
the
day
of
Jehovah
6
They
have
seen
false
visions
and
foretold
a
lie
those
who
are
saying
The
word
of
Jehovah
is

when
Jehovah
himself
has
not
sent
them
and
they
have
waited
for
their
word
to
come
true
7
Is
it
not
a
false
vision
that
you
have
seen
and
a
lie
that
you
have
foretold
when
you
say
The
word
of
Jehovah
is

when
I
have
not
said
anything
8
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
you
have
spoken
what
is
false
and
your
visions
are
a
lie
I
am
against
you

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
9
My
hand
is
against
the
prophets
whose
visions
are
false
and
who
foretell
a
lie
They
will
not
be
among
the
people
with
whom
I
confide
nor
will
they
be
written
in
the
registry
of
the
house
of
Israel
nor
will
they
return
to
the
land
of
Israel
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
10
All
of
this
is
because
they
have
led
my
people
astray
by
saying
There
is
peace
when
there
is
no
peace
When
a
flimsy
partition
wall
is
built
they
are
plastering
it
with
whitewash
11
Tell
those
plastering
with
whitewash
that
it
will
fall
A
torrential
downpour
will
come
hailstones
will
fall
and
powerful
windstorms
will
break
it
down
12
And
when
the
wall
falls
you
will
be
asked
Where
is
your
coating
of
plaster
13
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
cause
powerful
windstorms
to
burst
forth
in
my
wrath
and
a
torrential
downpour
in
my
anger
and
hailstones
in
destructive
fury
14
I
will
tear
down
the
wall
that
you
plastered
with
whitewash
and
bring
it
down
to
the
earth
and
its
foundation
will
be
exposed
When
the
city
falls
you
will
perish
within
her
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
15
When
I
fully
unleash
my
wrath
upon
the
wall
and
upon
those
who
plastered
it
with
whitewash
I
will
say
to
you
The
wall
is
no
more
and
those
plastering
it
are
no
more
16
The
prophets
of
Israel
are
gone
those
who
prophesy
to
Jerusalem
and
who
see
visions
of
peace
for
her
when
there
is
no
peace

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
17
As
for
you
son
of
man
set
your
face
against
the
daughters
of
your
people
who
fabricate
their
own
prophecies
and
prophesy
against
them
18
Tell
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Woe
to
the
women
who
sew
together
bands
for
all
arms
and
make
veils
for
heads
of
every
size
in
order
to
hunt
down
peoples
lives
Are
you
hunting
for
the
lives
of
my
people
and
trying
to
preserve
your
own
lives
19
Will
you
profane
me
among
my
people
for
handfuls
of
barley
and
for
scraps
of
bread
putting
to
death
those
who
should
not
die
and
keeping
alive
those
who
should
not
live
doing
so
by
your
lies
to
my
people
who
listen
to
your
lies
20
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
against
your
bands
O
women
which
you
use
to
hunt
down
people
as
though
they
were
birds
and
I
will
rip
them
from
your
arms
and
release
those
whom
you
are
hunting
down
like
birds
21
I
will
rip
away
your
veils
and
rescue
my
people
out
of
your
hand
and
they
will
no
longer
be
something
for
you
to
catch
in
the
hunt
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
22
For
you
have
disheartened
the
righteous
one
with
your
falsehood
when
I
was
not
causing
him
distress
and
you
have
strengthened
the
hands
of
the
wicked
one
so
that
he
does
not
turn
back
from
his
bad
way
and
stay
alive
23
Therefore
you
women
will
no
longer
see
false
visions
and
practice
divination
and
I
will
rescue
my
people
from
your
hand
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
1
And
some
of
the
elders
of
Israel
came
and
sat
down
before
me
2
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
3
Son
of
man
these
men
are
determined
to
follow
their
disgusting
idols
and
they
have
set
up
a
stumbling
block
that
causes
people
to
sin
Should
I
let
them
inquire
of
me
4
Now
speak
with
them
and
tell
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
If
an
Israelite
is
determined
to
follow
his
disgusting
idols
and
sets
up
a
stumbling
block
causing
people
to
sin
and
he
then
comes
to
inquire
of
a
prophet
I
Jehovah
will
answer
him
appropriately
according
to
his
many
disgusting
idols
5
For
I
will
cause
terror
in
the
hearts
of
the
house
of
Israel
because
they
have
all
withdrawn
from
me
and
have
gone
after
their
disgusting
idols
6
So
tell
the
house
of
Israel
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Come
back
and
turn
away
from
your
disgusting
idols
and
turn
your
faces
away
from
all
your
detestable
practices
7
For
if
any
Israelite
or
foreign
resident
living
in
Israel
separates
himself
from
me
and
is
determined
to
follow
his
disgusting
idols
and
sets
up
a
stumbling
block
that
causes
people
to
sin
and
then
comes
to
inquire
of
my
prophet
I
Jehovah
I
will
personally
answer
him
8
I
will
set
my
face
against
that
man
and
make
him
a
warning
sign
and
a
proverbial
saying
and
I
will
cut
him
off
from
my
people
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
9
But
if
the
prophet
is
fooled
and
gives
a
response
it
is
I
Jehovah
who
have
fooled
that
prophet
I
will
then
stretch
out
my
hand
against
him
and
annihilate
him
from
my
people
Israel
10
They
will
have
to
bear
their
guilt
the
guilt
of
the
inquirer
will
be
the
same
as
the
guilt
of
the
prophet
11
so
that
the
house
of
Israel
may
stop
wandering
away
from
me
and
stop
defiling
themselves
by
all
their
transgressions
And
they
will
be
my
people
and
I
will
be
their
God

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
12
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
13
Son
of
man
if
a
land
sins
against
me
by
acting
unfaithfully
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand
against
it
and
destroy
its
food
supply
and
I
will
send
famine
upon
it
and
cut
off
man
and
animal
from
it
14
Even
if
these
three
men—Noah
Daniel
and
Job—were
within
it
they
would
be
able
to
save
only
themselves
because
of
their
righteousness

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
15
Or
suppose
I
make
vicious
wild
animals
pass
through
the
land
and
they
depopulate
it
and
make
it
a
wasteland
without
anyone
passing
through
because
of
the
wild
animals
16
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
even
if
these
three
men
were
in
it
they
would
save
neither
their
sons
nor
their
daughters
they
would
save
only
themselves
and
the
land
would
become
desolate
17
Or
suppose
I
bring
a
sword
against
that
land
and
say
Let
a
sword
pass
through
the
land

and
cut
off
from
it
both
man
and
animal
18
even
if
these
three
men
were
in
it
as
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
they
would
save
neither
their
sons
nor
their
daughters
they
would
save
only
themselves
19
Or
suppose
I
send
a
pestilence
into
that
land
and
pour
out
my
rage
on
it
with
bloodshed
to
cut
off
from
it
man
and
animal
20
even
if
Noah
Daniel
and
Job
were
in
it
as
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
they
would
save
neither
their
sons
nor
their
daughters
they
would
save
only
themselves
because
of
their
righteousness
21
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
So
it
will
be
when
I
send
my
four
punishments—sword
famine
vicious
wild
animal
and
pestilence—against
Jerusalem
to
cut
off
man
and
animal
from
it
22
However
some
left
in
it
will
escape
and
be
brought
out
both
sons
and
daughters
They
are
coming
to
you
and
when
you
see
their
ways
and
their
deeds
you
will
certainly
be
comforted
over
the
calamity
that
I
brought
on
Jerusalem
over
everything
that
I
did
to
it
23
They
will
comfort
you
when
you
see
their
ways
and
their
deeds
and
you
will
know
that
it
was
not
without
cause
that
I
did
what
I
had
to
do
to
it

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
how
does
the
wood
of
the
vine
compare
with
that
of
any
other
tree
or
branch
from
the
trees
of
the
forest
3
Can
a
pole
from
it
be
used
to
do
work
Or
do
people
make
a
peg
from
it
to
hang
utensils
on
4
Look
It
is
thrown
into
the
fire
for
fuel
and
the
fire
consumes
both
ends
and
scorches
the
middle
Is
it
now
fit
for
any
work
5
Even
when
it
was
whole
it
could
not
be
used
for
anything
How
much
less
useful
it
will
be
when
the
fire
has
consumed
and
scorched
it
6
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Just
like
the
wood
of
the
vine
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
which
I
have
given
as
fuel
for
the
fire
so
I
will
deal
with
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
7
I
have
set
my
face
against
them
They
have
escaped
from
the
fire
but
fire
will
consume
them
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
set
my
face
against
them
8
And
I
will
make
the
land
desolate
because
they
have
acted
unfaithfully

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
make
known
to
Jerusalem
her
detestable
practices
3
You
must
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
to
Jerusalem
Your
origin
and
your
birth
were
in
the
land
of
the
Canaanite
Your
father
was
an
Amorite
and
your
mother
was
a
Hittite
4
As
for
your
birth
on
the
day
you
were
born
your
umbilical
cord
was
not
cut
you
were
not
washed
in
water
to
make
you
clean
you
were
not
rubbed
with
salt
and
you
were
not
wrapped
in
cloths
5
No
one
pitied
you
enough
to
do
any
of
these
things
No
one
had
compassion
for
you
Instead
you
were
thrown
into
the
open
field
because
you
were
hated
on
the
day
you
were
born
6
When
I
was
passing
by
I
saw
you
kicking
about
in
your
own
blood
and
as
you
lay
there
in
your
blood
I
said
Keep
living
Yes
I
said
to
you
lying
there
in
your
blood
Keep
living
7
I
made
you
a
very
great
multitude
like
plants
sprouting
in
the
field
and
you
grew
up
and
developed
and
wore
the
finest
ornaments
Your
breasts
became
firm
and
your
hair
grew
but
you
were
still
naked
and
exposed
8
When
I
was
passing
by
and
saw
you
I
noticed
that
you
were
old
enough
for
expressions
of
love
So
I
spread
my
garment
over
you
and
covered
your
nakedness
and
made
an
oath
and
entered
into
a
covenant
with
you

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
and
you
became
mine
9
Furthermore
I
washed
you
with
water
and
rinsed
away
your
blood
and
put
oil
on
you
10
I
then
clothed
you
with
an
embroidered
garment
and
gave
you
fine
leather
sandals
and
wrapped
you
in
fine
linen
and
I
clothed
you
with
costly
garments
11
I
adorned
you
with
ornaments
and
put
bracelets
on
your
hands
and
a
necklace
around
your
neck
12
I
also
put
a
ring
in
your
nose
and
earrings
on
your
ears
and
a
beautiful
crown
on
your
head
13
You
kept
adorning
yourself
with
gold
and
silver
and
your
clothing
was
fine
linen
costly
material
and
an
embroidered
garment
Fine
flour
honey
and
oil
were
what
you
ate
and
you
grew
to
be
extremely
beautiful
and
you
became
fit
to
be
a
queen
14
Your
fame
began
to
spread
among
the
nations
because
of
your
beauty
for
it
was
perfect
because
my
own
splendor
I
placed
upon
you

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
15
But
you
began
to
trust
in
your
beauty
and
you
became
a
prostitute
because
of
your
fame
You
lavished
your
acts
of
prostitution
on
everyone
passing
by
and
your
beauty
became
his
16
You
took
some
of
your
garments
and
made
colorful
high
places
where
you
prostituted
yourself—such
things
should
not
take
place
nor
should
they
ever
happen
17
You
also
took
your
beautiful
jewelry
made
from
the
gold
and
silver
that
I
had
given
to
you
and
you
made
for
yourself
male
images
and
prostituted
yourself
with
them
18
And
you
took
your
embroidered
garments
and
covered
them
and
you
offered
them
my
oil
and
my
incense
19
And
the
bread
that
I
had
given
to
you—made
from
fine
flour
oil
and
honey
that
I
gave
you
to
eat—you
also
offered
to
them
as
a
pleasing
aroma
That
is
exactly
what
happened

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
20
You
took
your
sons
and
your
daughters
whom
you
had
borne
to
me
and
you
sacrificed
these
to
idols
to
be
devoured—have
your
acts
of
prostitution
not
gone
far
enough
21
You
slaughtered
my
sons
and
you
offered
them
as
sacrifices
by
making
them
pass
through
the
fire
22
While
engaging
in
all
your
detestable
practices
and
acts
of
prostitution
you
did
not
remember
the
days
of
your
youth
when
you
were
naked
and
exposed
kicking
about
in
your
own
blood
23
After
all
your
evil
woe
woe
to
you

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
24
You
built
yourself
a
mound
and
made
a
high
place
for
yourself
in
every
public
square
25
You
built
your
high
places
at
the
most
prominent
place
of
every
street
and
you
turned
your
beauty
into
something
detestable
by
offering
yourself
to
everyone
passing
by
and
you
multiplied
your
acts
of
prostitution
26
You
prostituted
yourself
to
the
sons
of
Egypt
your
lustful
neighbors
and
you
offended
me
with
your
countless
acts
of
prostitution
27
Now
I
will
bring
my
hand
against
you
and
diminish
your
food
allowance
and
give
you
over
to
the
will
of
the
women
who
hate
you
the
daughters
of
the
Philistines
who
were
appalled
because
of
your
obscene
conduct
28
Because
you
could
not
be
satisfied
you
then
prostituted
yourself
to
the
sons
of
Assyria
but
after
prostituting
yourself
to
them
you
still
did
not
find
satisfaction
29
So
you
increased
your
prostitution
toward
the
land
of
traders
and
toward
the
Chaldeans
but
even
then
you
did
not
find
satisfaction
30
How
sick
your
heart
was

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
when
you
did
all
these
things
behaving
like
a
brazen
prostitute
31
But
when
you
built
your
mound
at
the
most
prominent
place
of
every
street
and
made
your
high
place
in
every
public
square
you
were
not
like
a
prostitute
because
you
refused
any
payment
32
You
are
an
adulterous
wife
who
takes
strangers
instead
of
her
own
husband
33
People
give
all
prostitutes
a
gift
but
you
are
the
one
who
has
given
gifts
to
all
those
lusting
after
you
and
you
bribe
them
to
come
to
you
from
all
around
to
commit
prostitution
34
You
are
the
opposite
of
other
women
who
engage
in
prostitution
No
one
commits
prostitution
your
way
You
pay
others
and
they
do
not
pay
you
Your
way
is
the
opposite
35
Therefore
O
prostitute
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
36
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
your
lust
has
been
poured
out
and
your
nakedness
has
been
exposed
during
your
prostitution
with
your
lovers
and
all
your
detestable
disgusting
idols
to
which
you
even
sacrificed
the
blood
of
your
sons
37
therefore
I
am
collecting
together
all
the
lovers
you
have
given
pleasure
to
all
those
you
loved
together
with
all
those
you
hated
I
will
collect
them
together
against
you
from
all
around
and
expose
your
nakedness
to
them
and
they
will
see
you
completely
naked
38
And
I
will
punish
you
with
the
judgments
that
adulteresses
and
women
shedding
blood
deserve
and
your
blood
will
be
shed
in
rage
and
jealousy
39
I
will
give
you
into
their
hand
and
they
will
tear
down
your
mounds
and
your
high
places
will
be
pulled
down
and
they
will
strip
you
of
your
garments
and
take
your
beautiful
jewelry
and
leave
you
naked
and
exposed
40
They
will
bring
against
you
a
crowd
and
they
will
stone
you
and
will
slaughter
you
with
their
swords
41
They
will
burn
your
houses
with
fire
and
execute
judgment
on
you
before
the
eyes
of
many
women
and
I
will
bring
an
end
to
your
prostitution
and
you
will
stop
giving
payment
42
I
will
satisfy
my
rage
against
you
and
my
indignation
will
turn
away
from
you
and
I
will
be
calm
and
no
longer
feel
offended
43
Because
you
did
not
remember
the
days
of
your
youth
and
you
have
angered
me
by
doing
all
these
things
I
will
now
bring
the
consequences
of
your
ways
on
your
own
head

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
and
you
will
no
longer
carry
on
your
obscene
conduct
and
all
your
detestable
practices
44
Look
Everyone
who
uses
proverbs
will
apply
this
proverb
to
you
Like
mother
like
daughter
45
You
are
the
daughter
of
your
mother
who
despised
her
husband
and
her
children
And
you
are
the
sister
of
your
sisters
who
despised
their
husbands
and
their
children
Your
mother
was
a
Hittite
and
your
father
was
an
Amorite
46
Your
older
sister
is
Samaria
who
is
dwelling
to
the
north
of
you
with
her
daughters
and
your
younger
sister
who
is
dwelling
to
the
south
of
you
is
Sodom
with
her
daughters
47
Not
only
did
you
walk
in
their
ways
and
follow
their
detestable
practices
but
in
a
short
while
you
were
even
more
corrupt
in
all
your
conduct
than
they
were
48
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Sodom
your
sister
and
her
daughters
have
not
done
what
you
and
your
daughters
have
done
49
Look
This
was
the
error
of
Sodom
your
sister
She
and
her
daughters
were
proud
and
had
an
abundance
of
food
and
carefree
tranquillity
yet
they
did
not
support
the
afflicted
and
the
poor
50
They
remained
haughty
and
carried
on
detestable
practices
in
my
sight
so
I
found
it
necessary
to
remove
them
51
Nor
did
Samaria
commit
even
half
as
many
sins
as
you
did
You
kept
making
your
detestable
practices
abound
more
than
they
have
to
the
point
that
your
sisters
appeared
righteous
because
of
all
your
detestable
practices
52
You
must
now
bear
your
humiliation
because
you
have
justified
the
behavior
of
your
sisters
On
account
of
your
sin
of
acting
more
detestably
than
they
have
they
are
more
righteous
than
you
So
now
be
ashamed
and
bear
the
humiliation
of
making
your
sisters
appear
righteous
53
And
I
will
gather
their
captives
the
captives
of
Sodom
and
her
daughters
and
the
captives
of
Samaria
and
her
daughters
I
will
also
gather
your
captives
along
with
them
54
so
that
you
may
bear
your
humiliation
and
you
will
feel
humiliated
because
of
what
you
have
done
by
comforting
them
55
Your
own
sisters
Sodom
and
her
daughters
will
return
to
their
former
state
and
Samaria
and
her
daughters
will
return
to
their
former
state
and
you
along
with
your
own
daughters
will
return
to
your
former
state
56
Sodom
your
sister
was
not
worthy
of
your
mention
in
the
day
of
your
pride
57
before
your
own
wickedness
was
exposed
Now
the
daughters
of
Syria
and
her
neighbors
reproach
you
and
the
daughters
of
the
Philistines
those
all
around
you
treat
you
with
scorn
58
You
will
bear
the
consequences
of
your
obscene
conduct
and
your
detestable
practices

declares
Jehovah
59
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
now
do
with
you
just
as
you
have
done
for
you
despised
the
oath
by
breaking
my
covenant
60
But
I
myself
will
remember
the
covenant
that
I
made
with
you
in
the
days
of
your
youth
and
I
will
establish
with
you
a
permanent
covenant
61
You
will
remember
your
behavior
and
feel
humiliated
when
you
welcome
your
sisters
those
older
than
you
as
well
as
those
younger
than
you
and
I
will
give
them
to
you
as
daughters
but
not
because
of
your
covenant
62
And
I
myself
will
establish
my
covenant
with
you
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
63
Then
you
will
remember
and
be
too
ashamed
to
open
your
mouth
because
of
your
humiliation
when
I
make
an
atonement
for
you
despite
all
that
you
have
done

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
tell
a
riddle
and
relate
a
proverb
about
the
house
of
Israel
3
You
must
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
The
great
eagle
with
great
wings
long
pinions
and
full
colorful
plumage
came
to
Lebanon
and
took
the
top
of
the
cedar
4
He
plucked
off
its
topmost
shoot
and
brought
it
to
the
land
of
traders
and
set
it
down
in
a
city
of
traders
5
He
then
took
some
of
the
seed
of
the
land
and
put
it
in
a
fertile
field
He
planted
it
like
a
willow
by
abundant
waters
6
So
it
sprouted
and
became
a
low
sprawling
vine
with
its
foliage
facing
inward
and
its
roots
growing
under
it
Thus
it
became
a
vine
and
produced
shoots
and
sent
out
branches
7
And
there
came
another
great
eagle
with
great
wings
and
large
pinions
This
vine
then
stretched
its
roots
eagerly
toward
him
away
from
the
garden
beds
where
it
was
planted
and
it
sent
out
its
foliage
toward
him
so
that
he
would
irrigate
it
8
It
had
already
been
planted
in
a
good
field
near
abundant
waters
in
order
to
produce
branches
to
bear
fruit
and
to
become
a
majestic
vine
9
Say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Will
it
prosper
Will
someone
not
tear
out
its
roots
and
make
its
fruit
rot
and
cause
its
sprouts
to
wither
It
will
become
so
dry
that
neither
a
strong
arm
nor
many
people
will
be
needed
to
pull
it
up
by
the
roots
10
Although
it
is
transplanted
will
it
prosper
Will
it
not
dry
up
completely
when
the
east
wind
blows
on
it
It
will
dry
up
in
the
garden
bed
where
it
sprouted
11
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
12
Please
tell
the
rebellious
house
Do
you
not
realize
what
these
things
mean
Say
Look
The
king
of
Babylon
came
to
Jerusalem
and
took
its
king
and
its
princes
and
brought
them
back
with
him
to
Babylon
13
Furthermore
he
took
one
of
the
royal
offspring
and
made
a
covenant
with
him
and
put
him
under
an
oath
Then
he
took
away
the
prominent
men
of
the
land
14
so
that
the
kingdom
would
be
brought
low
unable
to
rise
up
so
that
only
by
keeping
his
covenant
might
it
continue
to
exist
15
But
the
king
finally
rebelled
against
him
by
sending
his
messengers
to
Egypt
to
obtain
horses
and
a
large
army
from
them
Will
he
succeed
Will
the
one
doing
these
things
escape
punishment
Can
he
break
the
covenant
and
still
escape
16
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
he
will
die
in
Babylon
in
the
place
where
the
king
who
made
him
king
lives
the
one
whose
oath
he
despised
and
whose
covenant
he
broke
17
And
the
great
army
and
numerous
troops
of
Pharaoh
will
be
of
no
help
in
the
war
when
siege
ramparts
are
raised
and
siege
walls
are
built
to
destroy
many
lives
18
He
has
despised
an
oath
and
broken
a
covenant
Even
though
he
gave
his
promise
he
has
done
all
these
things
and
he
will
not
escape
19
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
As
surely
as
I
am
alive
I
will
bring
upon
his
head
the
consequences
of
despising
my
oath
and
breaking
my
covenant
20
I
will
cast
my
net
over
him
and
he
will
be
caught
in
my
hunting
net
I
will
bring
him
to
Babylon
and
enter
into
judgment
with
him
there
because
of
the
unfaithfulness
he
committed
against
me
21
All
the
fugitives
of
his
troops
will
fall
by
the
sword
and
those
remaining
will
be
scattered
in
every
direction
Then
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
22
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
take
a
shoot
from
the
top
of
the
lofty
cedar
and
plant
it
from
the
top
of
its
twigs
I
will
pluck
a
tender
shoot
and
I
myself
will
plant
it
on
a
high
and
lofty
mountain
23
On
a
high
mountain
of
Israel
I
will
plant
it
and
its
branches
will
grow
and
it
will
produce
fruit
and
become
a
majestic
cedar
And
every
kind
of
bird
will
live
beneath
it
and
reside
in
the
shadow
of
its
foliage
24
And
all
the
trees
of
the
field
will
have
to
know
that
I
myself
Jehovah
have
brought
down
the
high
tree
and
exalted
the
low
tree
I
have
dried
up
the
green
tree
and
made
the
dry
tree
blossom
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
and
have
done
it
1
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
What
does
this
proverb
that
you
quote
in
the
land
of
Israel
mean
Fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
but
the
teeth
of
the
sons
are
set
on
edge
3
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
you
will
not
continue
to
quote
this
saying
in
Israel
4
Look
All
the
souls—to
me
they
belong
As
the
soul
of
the
father
so
also
the
soul
of
the
son—to
me
they
belong
The
soul
who
sins
is
the
one
who
will
die
5
Suppose
that
a
man
is
righteous
and
does
what
is
just
and
right
6
He
does
not
eat
idolatrous
sacrifices
on
the
mountains
he
does
not
look
up
to
the
disgusting
idols
of
the
house
of
Israel
he
does
not
defile
his
neighbors
wife
or
have
relations
with
a
woman
who
is
menstruating
7
he
does
not
mistreat
anyone
but
he
returns
what
a
debtor
has
given
him
in
pledge
he
does
not
rob
anyone
but
he
gives
his
own
food
to
the
hungry
one
and
covers
the
naked
one
with
a
garment
8
he
does
not
charge
interest
or
engage
in
usury
but
he
refrains
from
acting
with
injustice
he
executes
true
justice
between
one
man
and
another
9
and
he
keeps
walking
in
my
statutes
and
observing
my
judicial
decisions
in
order
to
act
in
faithfulness
Such
a
man
is
righteous
and
will
surely
keep
living

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
10
But
suppose
that
he
has
become
father
to
a
son
who
is
a
robber
or
a
murderer
or
who
does
any
of
these
other
things
11
though
the
father
has
not
done
any
of
these
things—he
eats
idolatrous
sacrifices
on
the
mountains
defiles
his
neighbors
wife
12
mistreats
the
needy
and
the
poor
takes
things
by
robbery
does
not
return
a
pledge
looks
up
to
the
disgusting
idols
engages
in
detestable
practices
13
engages
in
usury
and
charges
interest—then
the
son
will
not
keep
living
Because
of
all
these
detestable
things
that
he
has
done
he
will
surely
be
put
to
death
His
own
blood
will
be
upon
him
14
But
suppose
that
a
father
has
a
son
who
sees
all
the
sins
his
father
has
committed
and
though
he
sees
them
he
does
not
do
such
things
15
He
does
not
eat
idolatrous
sacrifices
on
the
mountains
he
does
not
look
up
to
the
disgusting
idols
of
the
house
of
Israel
he
does
not
defile
his
neighbors
wife
16
he
does
not
mistreat
anyone
he
does
not
seize
what
was
pledged
he
does
not
take
anything
in
robbery
he
gives
his
own
food
to
the
hungry
one
and
covers
the
naked
one
with
a
garment
17
he
refrains
from
oppressing
the
poor
he
does
not
engage
in
usury
or
charge
interest
and
he
carries
out
my
judicial
decisions
and
walks
in
my
statutes
Such
a
man
will
not
die
because
of
the
error
of
his
father
He
will
surely
keep
living
18
But
because
his
father
practiced
fraud
robbed
his
brother
and
did
what
was
wrong
among
his
people
he
will
die
for
his
error
19
But
you
will
say
Why
does
the
son
not
bear
guilt
because
of
his
fathers
error
Since
the
son
has
done
what
is
just
and
righteous
has
kept
all
my
statutes
and
has
observed
them
he
will
surely
keep
living
20
The
soul
who
sins
is
the
one
who
will
die
A
son
will
bear
no
guilt
because
of
the
error
of
his
father
and
a
father
will
bear
no
guilt
because
of
the
error
of
his
son
The
righteousness
of
the
righteous
one
will
be
accounted
to
him
alone
and
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
one
will
be
accounted
to
him
alone
21
Now
if
someone
wicked
turns
away
from
all
the
sins
he
has
committed
and
keeps
my
statutes
and
does
what
is
just
and
righteous
he
will
surely
keep
living
He
will
not
die
22
None
of
the
transgressions
that
he
has
committed
will
be
held
against
him
He
will
keep
living
for
doing
what
is
righteous
23
Do
I
take
any
pleasure
at
all
in
the
death
of
a
wicked
person
declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Do
I
not
prefer
that
he
turn
away
from
his
ways
and
keep
living
24
But
when
someone
righteous
abandons
his
righteousness
and
does
what
is
wrong
doing
all
the
detestable
things
the
wicked
do
will
he
live
None
of
the
righteous
acts
that
he
did
will
be
remembered
For
his
unfaithfulness
and
the
sin
he
has
committed
he
will
die
25
But
you
will
say
The
way
of
Jehovah
is
unjust
Please
listen
O
house
of
Israel
Is
it
my
way
that
is
unjust
Is
it
not
your
ways
that
are
unjust
26
When
someone
righteous
abandons
his
righteousness
and
does
what
is
wrong
and
dies
because
of
it
he
will
die
for
his
own
wrongdoing
27
And
when
someone
wicked
turns
away
from
the
wickedness
that
he
has
committed
and
begins
to
do
what
is
just
and
righteous
he
will
preserve
his
own
life
28
When
he
realizes
and
turns
away
from
all
the
transgressions
that
he
has
committed
he
will
surely
keep
living
He
will
not
die
29
But
the
house
of
Israel
will
say
The
way
of
Jehovah
is
unjust
Is
it
really
my
ways
that
are
unjust
O
house
of
Israel
Is
it
not
your
ways
that
are
unjust
30
Therefore
I
will
judge
each
one
of
you
according
to
his
ways
O
house
of
Israel

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Turn
away
yes
turn
completely
away
from
all
your
transgressions
so
that
they
will
not
be
a
stumbling
block
bringing
guilt
upon
you
31
Rid
yourselves
of
all
the
transgressions
you
have
committed
and
acquire
a
new
heart
and
a
new
spirit
for
why
should
you
die
O
house
of
Israel
32
I
do
not
take
any
pleasure
in
the
death
of
anyone

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
So
turn
back
and
live
1
You
must
sing
a
dirge
concerning
the
chieftains
of
Israel
2
and
say
What
was
your
mother
A
lioness
among
lions
She
lay
down
among
strong
young
lions
and
reared
her
cubs

3
She
raised
one
of
her
cubs
and
he
became
a
strong
young
lion
He
learned
how
to
tear
prey
apart
He
even
devoured
humans

4
Nations
heard
about
him
and
caught
him
in
their
pit
And
they
brought
him
to
the
land
of
Egypt
with
hooks

5
She
waited
and
eventually
saw
that
there
was
no
hope
for
his
return
So
she
took
another
of
her
cubs
and
sent
him
out
as
a
strong
young
lion

6
He
also
walked
about
among
the
lions
and
became
a
strong
young
lion
He
learned
how
to
tear
prey
apart
and
he
even
devoured
humans

7
He
prowled
among
their
fortified
towers
and
devastated
their
cities
So
that
the
desolate
land
was
filled
with
the
sound
of
his
roaring

8
Nations
from
the
surrounding
districts
came
against
him
to
cast
their
net
over
him
And
he
was
caught
in
their
pit

9
With
hooks
they
put
him
in
a
cage
and
brought
him
to
the
king
of
Babylon
There
they
confined
him
so
that
his
voice
would
no
more
be
heard
on
the
mountains
of
Israel
10
Your
mother
was
like
a
vine
in
your
blood
planted
by
waters
It
bore
fruit
and
was
full
of
branches
because
of
the
abundant
water
11
It
developed
strong
branches
fit
for
the
scepters
of
rulers
It
grew
and
towered
over
the
other
trees
And
it
became
visible
because
of
its
height
and
because
of
the
abundance
of
its
foliage
12
But
in
fury
she
was
uprooted
and
thrown
to
the
earth
And
an
east
wind
dried
up
her
fruit
Her
strong
branches
were
torn
off
and
became
dry
and
fire
consumed
them
13
Now
she
is
planted
in
the
wilderness
In
a
waterless
thirsty
land
14
The
fire
spread
from
her
branches
and
consumed
her
shoots
and
her
fruit
And
there
was
no
strong
branch
left
no
scepter
for
ruling
That
is
a
dirge
and
it
will
serve
as
a
dirge
1
Now
in
the
seventh
year
in
the
fifth
month
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
some
of
the
elders
of
Israel
came
and
sat
down
before
me
to
inquire
of
Jehovah
2
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
3
Son
of
man
speak
with
the
elders
of
Israel
and
tell
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Are
you
coming
to
inquire
of
me
As
surely
as
I
am
alive
I
will
not
respond
to
your
inquiry

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
4
Are
you
ready
to
judge
them
Are
you
ready
to
judge
them
son
of
man
Make
them
know
the
detestable
things
that
their
forefathers
did
5
Tell
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
In
the
day
I
chose
Israel
I
also
swore
to
the
offspring
of
the
house
of
Jacob
and
I
made
myself
known
to
them
in
the
land
of
Egypt
Yes
I
swore
to
them
and
said
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
6
In
that
day
I
swore
that
I
would
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
to
a
land
that
I
had
searched
out
for
them
one
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
It
was
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
lands
7
I
then
said
to
them
Each
of
you
must
throw
away
the
detestable
things
that
are
before
your
eyes
do
not
defile
yourselves
with
the
disgusting
idols
of
Egypt
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
8
But
they
rebelled
against
me
and
were
not
willing
to
listen
to
me
They
did
not
throw
away
the
detestable
things
that
were
before
them
and
they
would
not
abandon
the
disgusting
idols
of
Egypt
So
I
promised
to
pour
out
my
rage
on
them
and
to
unleash
my
anger
fully
against
them
in
the
land
of
Egypt
9
But
I
acted
for
the
sake
of
my
name
so
that
it
would
not
be
profaned
before
the
nations
among
whom
they
were
living
For
I
made
myself
known
to
them
before
these
nations
when
I
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
10
So
I
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
and
led
them
into
the
wilderness
11
I
then
gave
them
my
statutes
and
made
my
judicial
decisions
known
to
them
so
that
the
man
who
follows
them
may
have
life
by
them
12
I
also
gave
my
sabbaths
to
them
as
a
sign
between
me
and
them
so
that
they
would
know
that
I
Jehovah
am
the
one
sanctifying
them
13
But
the
house
of
Israel
rebelled
against
me
in
the
wilderness
They
did
not
walk
in
my
statutes
and
they
rejected
my
judicial
decisions
which
if
a
man
follows
them
he
will
have
life
by
them
They
utterly
profaned
my
sabbaths
So
I
promised
to
pour
out
my
fury
on
them
in
the
wilderness
to
exterminate
them
14
I
acted
for
the
sake
of
my
own
name
so
that
it
would
not
be
profaned
before
the
nations
in
whose
sight
I
brought
them
out
15
I
also
swore
to
them
in
the
wilderness
that
I
would
not
bring
them
into
the
land
that
I
had
given
them—a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
lands—
16
because
they
rejected
my
judicial
decisions
they
did
not
walk
in
my
statutes
and
they
profaned
my
sabbaths
for
their
heart
was
following
after
their
disgusting
idols
17
But
I
felt
sorry
for
them
and
I
did
not
destroy
them
I
did
not
exterminate
them
in
the
wilderness
18
I
said
to
their
sons
in
the
wilderness
Do
not
walk
in
the
regulations
of
your
forefathers
or
keep
their
judgments
or
defile
yourselves
with
their
disgusting
idols
19
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
Walk
in
my
statutes
and
keep
my
judicial
decisions
and
carry
them
out
20
And
sanctify
my
sabbaths
and
they
will
serve
as
a
sign
between
me
and
you
for
you
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
21
But
the
sons
began
to
rebel
against
me
They
did
not
walk
in
my
statutes
and
they
did
not
observe
and
carry
out
my
judicial
decisions
which
if
a
man
follows
them
he
will
have
life
by
them
My
sabbaths
they
profaned
So
I
promised
to
pour
out
my
rage
on
them
and
to
unleash
my
anger
against
them
fully
in
the
wilderness
22
But
I
refrained
and
acted
for
the
sake
of
my
own
name
so
that
it
should
not
be
profaned
before
the
nations
in
whose
sight
I
brought
them
out
23
Also
I
swore
to
them
in
the
wilderness
that
I
would
scatter
them
among
the
nations
and
disperse
them
among
the
lands
24
because
they
did
not
carry
out
my
judicial
decisions
and
they
rejected
my
statutes
they
profaned
my
sabbaths
and
they
followed
after
the
disgusting
idols
of
their
forefathers
25
I
also
allowed
them
to
follow
regulations
that
were
not
good
and
judicial
decisions
by
which
they
could
not
have
life
26
I
let
them
become
defiled
by
their
own
sacrifices—when
they
made
every
firstborn
child
pass
through
the
fire—in
order
to
make
them
desolate
so
that
they
would
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
27
So
speak
to
the
house
of
Israel
O
son
of
man
and
tell
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
In
this
way
also
your
forefathers
blasphemed
me
by
acting
unfaithfully
against
me
28
I
brought
them
into
the
land
that
I
swore
to
give
them
When
they
saw
all
the
high
hills
and
leafy
trees
they
began
offering
their
sacrifices
and
their
offensive
offerings
They
presented
the
pleasing
aromas
of
their
sacrifices
and
poured
out
their
drink
offerings
there
29
So
I
asked
them
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
high
place
to
which
you
go
It
is
still
called
High
Place
to
this
day
30
Now
say
to
the
house
of
Israel
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Are
you
defiling
yourselves
the
same
way
your
forefathers
did
by
going
after
their
disgusting
idols
to
commit
spiritual
prostitution
with
them
31
And
are
you
still
defiling
yourselves
to
this
day
by
offering
sacrifices
to
all
your
disgusting
idols
making
your
sons
pass
through
the
fire
Should
I
at
the
same
time
respond
to
your
inquiry
O
house
of
Israel
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
I
will
not
respond
to
your
inquiry
32
And
what
you
have
in
mind
when
you
say
Let
us
become
like
the
nations
like
the
families
of
the
other
lands
who
worship
wood
and
stone

it
will
never
happen
33
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
I
will
rule
as
king
over
you
with
a
mighty
hand
with
an
outstretched
arm
and
with
an
outpouring
of
rage
34
I
will
bring
you
out
from
the
peoples
and
collect
you
together
out
of
the
lands
where
you
have
been
scattered
with
a
mighty
hand
with
an
outstretched
arm
and
with
an
outpouring
of
rage
35
I
will
bring
you
into
the
wilderness
of
the
peoples
and
enter
into
judgment
with
you
there
face-to-face
36
Just
as
I
entered
into
judgment
with
your
forefathers
in
the
wilderness
of
the
land
of
Egypt
so
I
will
enter
into
judgment
with
you

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
37
I
will
make
you
pass
under
the
shepherds
staff
and
bring
you
under
obligation
to
the
covenant
38
But
I
will
remove
from
you
the
rebels
and
those
transgressing
against
me
For
I
will
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
their
foreign
residence
but
they
will
not
enter
the
land
of
Israel
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
39
As
for
you
O
house
of
Israel
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Each
of
you
go
and
serve
his
disgusting
idols
But
afterward
if
you
do
not
listen
to
me
you
will
no
longer
be
able
to
profane
my
holy
name
by
your
sacrifices
and
your
disgusting
idols
40
For
in
my
holy
mountain
on
a
high
mountain
of
Israel

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
is
where
the
whole
house
of
Israel
all
of
them
will
serve
me
in
the
land
I
will
take
pleasure
in
them
there
and
I
will
require
your
contributions
and
the
firstfruits
of
your
offerings
all
your
holy
things
41
Because
of
the
pleasing
aroma
I
will
take
pleasure
in
you
when
I
bring
you
out
from
the
peoples
and
collect
you
together
from
the
lands
to
which
you
have
been
scattered
and
I
will
be
sanctified
among
you
before
the
eyes
of
the
nations
42
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
bring
you
to
the
land
of
Israel
into
the
land
that
I
swore
to
give
to
your
forefathers
43
And
there
you
will
remember
your
conduct
and
all
your
deeds
by
which
you
defiled
yourselves
and
you
will
loathe
yourselves
because
of
all
the
bad
things
that
you
did
44
Then
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
deal
with
you
for
the
sake
of
my
name
not
according
to
your
wicked
conduct
or
according
to
your
corrupted
dealings
O
house
of
Israel

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
45
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
46
Son
of
man
turn
your
face
in
the
direction
of
the
southern
quarter
and
proclaim
to
the
south
and
prophesy
to
the
forest
of
the
field
of
the
south
47
Say
to
the
forest
of
the
south
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
setting
a
fire
ablaze
against
you
and
it
will
consume
every
green
tree
and
every
dry
tree
in
you
The
burning
flame
will
not
be
extinguished
and
every
face
will
be
scorched
by
it
from
south
to
north
48
And
all
flesh
will
see
that
I
myself
Jehovah
have
set
it
afire
so
that
it
will
not
be
extinguished
49
And
I
said
Alas
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
They
are
saying
about
me
Is
he
not
just
speaking
in
riddles
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
turn
your
face
toward
Jerusalem
and
make
a
proclamation
against
the
holy
places
and
prophesy
against
the
land
of
Israel
3
Say
to
the
land
of
Israel
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
against
you
and
I
will
bring
my
sword
out
of
its
sheath
and
cut
off
from
you
both
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
4
Because
I
will
cut
off
from
you
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
my
sword
will
be
drawn
from
its
sheath
against
all
flesh
from
south
to
north
5
All
people
will
have
to
know
that
I
myself
Jehovah
have
drawn
my
sword
from
its
sheath
It
will
not
go
back
again
6
And
you
son
of
man
sigh
while
you
tremble
yes
sigh
bitterly
before
them
7
And
if
they
say
to
you
Why
are
you
sighing
you
will
say
Because
of
a
report
For
it
will
certainly
come
and
every
heart
will
melt
with
fear
and
every
hand
will
hang
limp
and
every
spirit
will
become
dejected
and
every
knee
will
drip
with
water
Look
It
will
certainly
come—it
will
take
place

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
8
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
9
Son
of
man
prophesy
and
say
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Say
A
sword
A
sword
is
sharpened
and
it
is
polished
10
It
is
sharpened
to
inflict
a
great
slaughter
it
is
polished
to
flash
like
lightning
Should
we
not
rejoice
Will
it
reject
the
scepter
of
my
own
son
as
it
does
every
tree
11
It
is
given
to
be
polished
and
to
be
wielded
with
the
hand
This
sword
is
sharpened
and
polished
to
be
put
into
the
hand
of
an
executioner
12
Cry
out
and
wail
son
of
man
for
it
has
come
against
my
people
it
is
against
all
the
chieftains
of
Israel
These
will
be
victims
of
the
sword
along
with
my
people
So
strike
your
thigh
in
grief
13
For
an
examination
has
been
made
and
what
will
happen
if
the
sword
rejects
the
scepter
It
will
cease
to
exist

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
14
And
you
son
of
man
prophesy
and
clap
your
hands
and
repeat
A
sword
three
times
It
is
the
sword
of
the
slain
victims
the
sword
of
great
slaughter
that
surrounds
them
15
Their
hearts
will
melt
with
fear
and
many
will
fall
at
their
city
gates
I
will
inflict
a
slaughter
by
the
sword
Yes
it
flashes
like
lightning
and
is
polished
for
a
slaughter
16
Cut
sharply
to
the
right
Swing
to
the
left
Go
wherever
your
blade
is
directed
17
I
will
also
clap
my
hands
and
satisfy
my
rage
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
18
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
19
As
for
you
son
of
man
mark
out
two
ways
for
the
sword
of
the
king
of
Babylon
to
come
Both
of
them
will
originate
from
the
same
land
and
a
signpost
should
be
set
up
where
the
road
branches
off
to
the
two
cities
20
You
should
mark
out
one
way
for
the
sword
to
come
against
Rabbah
of
the
Ammonites
and
the
other
way
against
fortified
Jerusalem
in
Judah
21
For
the
king
of
Babylon
stops
to
use
divination
at
the
fork
in
the
road
where
the
two
roads
branch
off
He
shakes
the
arrows
He
consults
his
idols
he
examines
the
liver
22
The
divination
in
his
right
hand
is
pointed
toward
Jerusalem
to
set
up
battering
rams
to
give
the
word
for
slaughter
to
sound
the
battle
cry
to
set
battering
rams
against
the
gates
to
throw
up
a
siege
rampart
to
build
a
siege
wall
23
But
it
will
seem
like
false
divination
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
had
sworn
oaths
to
them
But
he
remembers
their
guilt
and
will
capture
them
24
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
You
have
caused
your
own
guilt
to
be
remembered
by
exposing
your
transgressions
and
causing
your
sins
to
be
seen
in
all
your
actions
Now
that
you
have
been
remembered
you
will
be
taken
by
force
25
But
your
day
has
come
O
fatally
wounded
wicked
chieftain
of
Israel
the
time
of
your
final
punishment
26
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Remove
the
turban
and
take
off
the
crown
This
will
not
remain
the
same
Raise
up
the
low
one
and
bring
low
the
high
one
27
A
ruin
a
ruin
a
ruin
I
will
make
it
And
it
will
not
belong
to
anyone
until
the
one
who
has
the
legal
right
comes
and
I
will
give
it
to
him
28
And
you
son
of
man
prophesy
and
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
about
the
Ammonites
and
about
their
insults
Say
A
sword
A
sword
is
drawn
for
a
slaughter
it
is
polished
to
devour
and
to
flash
like
lightning
29
Despite
the
false
visions
and
lying
divination
about
you
you
will
be
piled
up
on
the
slain
the
wicked
men
whose
day
has
come
the
time
of
their
final
punishment
30
Return
it
to
its
sheath
I
will
judge
you
in
the
place
that
you
were
created
in
the
land
of
your
origin
31
I
will
pour
out
my
indignation
on
you
I
will
blow
upon
you
with
the
fire
of
my
fury
and
I
will
hand
you
over
to
brutal
men
the
craftsmen
of
destruction
32
You
will
become
fuel
for
the
fire
your
own
blood
will
be
shed
in
the
land
and
you
will
be
remembered
no
more
for
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
1
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
As
for
you
son
of
man
are
you
prepared
to
pronounce
judgment
on
the
bloodguilty
city
and
to
make
known
to
her
all
her
detestable
things
3
You
are
to
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
O
city
that
sheds
blood
within
herself
whose
time
is
coming
who
makes
disgusting
idols
to
defile
herself
4
your
bloodshed
has
made
you
guilty
and
your
disgusting
idols
have
made
you
unclean
You
have
hastened
the
end
of
your
days
and
the
end
of
your
years
has
come
That
is
why
I
will
make
you
an
object
of
reproach
to
the
nations
and
an
object
of
mockery
to
all
the
lands
5
The
lands
nearby
and
those
far
away
from
you
will
mock
you
you
whose
name
is
unclean
and
who
are
filled
with
turmoil
6
Look
Each
of
the
chieftains
of
Israel
among
you
uses
his
authority
to
shed
blood
7
Within
you
they
treat
their
father
and
mother
with
contempt
They
defraud
the
foreign
resident
and
they
mistreat
the
fatherless
child
and
the
widow
8
My
holy
places
you
despise
and
my
sabbaths
you
profane
9
Within
you
are
slanderers
intent
on
shedding
blood
Within
you
they
eat
sacrifices
on
the
mountains
and
carry
on
obscene
conduct
in
your
midst
10
Within
you
they
dishonor
their
fathers
bed
and
they
violate
a
woman
unclean
in
her
menstruation
11
Within
you
one
man
acts
detestably
with
his
neighbors
wife
another
defiles
his
own
daughter-in-law
with
obscene
conduct
and
another
violates
his
sister
the
daughter
of
his
own
father
12
Within
you
they
take
a
bribe
to
shed
blood
You
lend
on
interest
or
for
a
profit
and
you
extort
money
from
your
neighbors
Yes
you
have
entirely
forgotten
me

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
13
Look
I
clap
my
hands
in
disgust
at
the
dishonest
gain
you
have
made
and
over
the
acts
of
bloodshed
in
your
midst
14
Will
your
courage
endure
and
your
hands
remain
strong
in
the
days
when
I
take
action
against
you
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
and
I
will
take
action
15
I
will
scatter
you
among
the
nations
and
disperse
you
among
the
lands
and
I
will
put
an
end
to
your
uncleanness
16
And
you
will
be
dishonored
before
the
nations
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
17
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
18
Son
of
man
the
house
of
Israel
has
become
like
worthless
dross
to
me
All
of
them
are
copper
and
tin
and
iron
and
lead
in
a
furnace
They
have
become
the
dross
of
silver
19
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
all
of
you
have
become
like
worthless
dross
I
am
collecting
you
together
inside
Jerusalem
20
Just
as
silver
and
copper
and
iron
and
lead
and
tin
are
collected
inside
a
furnace
in
order
to
blow
fire
upon
them
and
melt
them
so
I
will
collect
you
together
in
my
anger
and
in
my
rage
and
I
will
blow
upon
you
and
make
you
melt
21
I
will
bring
you
together
and
blow
upon
you
with
the
fire
of
my
fury
and
you
will
be
melted
inside
of
her
22
Just
as
silver
is
melted
in
a
furnace
so
you
will
be
melted
inside
her
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
myself
Jehovah
have
poured
out
my
rage
on
you
23
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
24
Son
of
man
say
to
her
You
are
a
land
that
will
not
be
cleansed
or
rained
on
in
the
day
of
indignation
25
Her
prophets
have
conspired
within
her
like
a
roaring
lion
tearing
prey
They
are
devouring
people
They
are
seizing
treasure
and
precious
things
They
have
made
many
widows
within
her
26
Her
priests
have
violated
my
law
and
they
keep
profaning
my
holy
places
They
make
no
distinction
between
what
is
holy
and
what
is
common
and
they
fail
to
make
known
what
is
unclean
and
what
is
clean
and
they
refuse
to
observe
my
sabbaths
and
I
am
profaned
among
them
27
Her
princes
in
her
midst
are
like
wolves
tearing
prey
they
shed
blood
and
kill
people
to
make
dishonest
gain
28
But
her
prophets
have
plastered
over
their
deeds
with
whitewash
They
see
false
visions
and
give
lying
divination
and
they
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says

when
Jehovah
himself
has
not
spoken
29
The
people
of
the
land
have
defrauded
and
committed
robbery
they
have
mistreated
the
needy
and
the
poor
and
they
have
defrauded
the
foreign
resident
and
denied
him
justice
30
I
was
looking
for
a
man
from
among
them
who
would
repair
the
stone
wall
or
stand
before
me
in
the
breach
in
behalf
of
the
land
so
that
it
would
not
be
destroyed
but
I
found
no
one
31
So
I
will
pour
out
my
indignation
on
them
and
exterminate
them
with
the
fire
of
my
fury
I
will
bring
the
consequences
of
their
way
on
their
own
head

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
there
were
two
women
who
were
the
daughters
of
the
same
mother
3
They
became
prostitutes
in
Egypt
from
their
youth
they
engaged
in
prostitution
Their
breasts
were
squeezed
there
and
their
virgin
bosoms
were
fondled
4
Their
names
were
Oholah
the
older
one
and
her
sister
Oholibah
They
became
mine
and
gave
birth
to
sons
and
daughters
As
for
their
names
Oholah
is
Samaria
and
Oholibah
is
Jerusalem
5
Oholah
began
to
prostitute
herself
while
she
belonged
to
me
She
lusted
after
her
passionate
lovers
her
neighbors
the
Assyrians
6
They
were
governors
clothed
in
blue
and
deputy
rulers—all
desirable
young
men
mounted
on
their
horses
7
She
continued
to
prostitute
herself
with
all
the
choicest
sons
of
Assyria
and
she
defiled
herself
with
the
disgusting
idols
of
those
she
lusted
after
8
She
did
not
abandon
the
prostitution
she
practiced
in
Egypt
for
in
her
youth
they
had
lain
down
with
her
and
they
fondled
her
virgin
bosom
and
poured
out
their
lust
on
her
9
So
I
gave
her
into
the
hand
of
her
passionate
lovers
the
sons
of
Assyria
after
whom
she
had
lusted
10
They
exposed
her
nakedness
and
seized
her
sons
and
daughters
and
they
killed
her
with
a
sword
She
became
notorious
among
women
and
they
executed
judgment
against
her
11
When
her
sister
Oholibah
saw
it
her
lust
became
even
more
depraved
and
her
prostitution
was
worse
than
that
of
her
sister
12
She
lusted
after
her
neighbors
the
sons
of
Assyria
the
governors
and
deputy
rulers
who
were
clothed
in
splendor
and
mounted
on
horses—all
desirable
young
men
13
When
she
defiled
herself
I
saw
that
both
of
them
had
followed
the
same
course
14
But
she
kept
adding
to
her
acts
of
prostitution
She
saw
men
carved
on
the
wall
images
of
Chaldeans
carved
in
vermilion
15
wearing
belts
around
their
waist
with
flowing
turbans
on
their
heads
having
the
appearance
of
warriors
all
of
them
depicting
Babylonians
born
in
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
16
She
began
to
lust
after
them
as
soon
as
she
saw
them
and
she
sent
messengers
to
them
in
Chaldea
17
So
the
sons
of
Babylon
kept
coming
to
her
bed
of
lovemaking
and
they
defiled
her
with
their
lust
After
she
was
defiled
by
them
she
turned
away
from
them
in
disgust
18
When
she
went
on
brazenly
engaging
in
prostitution
and
exposing
her
nakedness
I
turned
away
from
her
in
disgust
just
as
I
had
turned
away
from
her
sister
in
disgust
19
And
she
kept
increasing
her
acts
of
prostitution
calling
to
mind
the
days
of
her
youth
when
she
prostituted
herself
in
the
land
of
Egypt
20
She
lusted
after
them
like
the
concubines
of
men
whose
male
members
are
like
those
of
a
donkey
and
whose
genitals
are
like
those
of
a
horse
21
You
yearned
for
the
obscene
conduct
of
your
youth
in
Egypt
when
they
fondled
your
bosom
the
breasts
of
your
youth
22
Therefore
Oholibah
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
stirring
up
your
lovers
whom
you
turned
away
from
in
disgust
and
I
will
bring
them
against
you
from
every
direction
23
the
sons
of
Babylon
and
all
the
Chaldeans
the
men
of
Pekod
and
Shoa
and
Koa
along
with
all
the
sons
of
Assyria
All
of
them
are
desirable
young
men
governors
and
deputy
rulers
warriors
and
handpicked
all
mounted
on
horses
24
They
will
attack
you
with
rumbling
war
chariots
and
wheels
and
with
a
great
assembly
of
troops
with
large
shield
and
buckler
and
helmet
They
will
take
up
positions
all
around
you
and
I
will
authorize
them
to
pass
judgment
and
they
will
judge
you
as
they
see
fit
25
I
will
express
my
indignation
against
you
and
they
will
deal
with
you
in
their
rage
They
will
cut
off
your
nose
and
your
ears
and
those
of
you
who
remain
will
fall
by
the
sword
They
will
take
away
your
sons
and
your
daughters
and
those
of
you
who
remain
will
be
consumed
by
fire
26
They
will
strip
off
your
garments
and
seize
your
beautiful
jewelry
27
I
will
put
an
end
to
your
obscene
conduct
and
your
prostitution
which
started
in
the
land
of
Egypt
You
will
stop
looking
at
them
and
you
will
remember
Egypt
no
more
28
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
about
to
hand
you
over
to
those
you
hate
those
you
turned
away
from
in
disgust
29
They
will
deal
with
you
in
hatred
and
take
away
all
you
have
toiled
for
and
leave
you
naked
and
exposed
The
shameful
nakedness
of
your
immorality
and
your
obscene
conduct
and
your
prostitution
will
be
exposed
30
These
things
will
be
done
to
you
because
you
chased
after
the
nations
like
a
prostitute
because
you
defiled
yourself
with
their
disgusting
idols
31
You
have
followed
the
same
course
as
your
sister
and
I
will
put
her
cup
into
your
hand
32
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
You
will
drink
the
deep
and
wide
cup
of
your
sister
And
you
will
become
an
object
of
laughter
and
ridicule
of
which
the
cup
contains
much
33
You
will
be
overcome
by
drunkenness
and
grief
A
cup
of
horror
and
desolation
The
cup
of
your
sister
Samaria
34
You
will
have
to
drink
it
and
drain
it
dry
and
gnaw
on
its
earthenware
fragmentsAnd
then
tear
out
your
breasts
For
I
myself
have
spoken

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
35
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
you
have
forgotten
me
and
have
completely
disregarded
me
you
will
bear
the
consequences
of
your
obscene
conduct
and
your
acts
of
prostitution
36
Jehovah
then
said
to
me
Son
of
man
will
you
pronounce
judgment
on
Oholah
and
Oholibah
and
confront
them
with
their
disgusting
practices
37
They
have
committed
adultery
and
there
is
blood
on
their
hands
Not
only
have
they
committed
adultery
with
their
disgusting
idols
but
they
have
also
made
their
sons
whom
they
bore
to
me
pass
through
the
fire
as
food
for
their
idols
38
Moreover
this
is
what
they
have
done
to
me
They
defiled
my
sanctuary
on
that
day
and
they
profaned
my
sabbaths
39
After
they
slaughtered
their
sons
as
sacrifices
to
their
disgusting
idols
they
came
into
my
sanctuary
to
profane
it
on
that
very
day
That
is
what
they
did
inside
my
own
house
40
They
even
sent
a
messenger
for
men
to
come
from
far
away
When
they
were
coming
you
washed
yourself
and
painted
your
eyes
and
adorned
yourself
with
ornaments
41
And
you
sat
down
on
a
magnificent
couch
with
a
table
set
in
front
of
it
on
which
you
put
my
incense
and
my
oil
42
The
sound
of
a
carefree
crowd
of
men
was
heard
there
among
whom
were
drunkards
brought
in
from
the
wilderness
They
put
bracelets
on
the
hands
of
the
women
and
beautiful
crowns
on
their
heads
43
Then
I
said
regarding
her
who
was
worn
out
with
adultery
Now
she
will
keep
committing
her
prostitution
44
So
they
kept
going
in
to
her
just
as
one
goes
to
a
prostitute
That
is
how
they
went
in
to
Oholah
and
to
Oholibah
the
women
of
obscene
conduct
45
But
righteous
men
will
render
to
her
the
appropriate
judgment
for
adultery
and
bloodshed
for
adulteresses
is
what
they
are
and
they
have
blood
on
their
hands
46
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
An
army
will
be
brought
against
them
to
make
them
an
object
of
horror
and
something
to
plunder
47
The
army
will
hurl
stones
at
them
and
cut
them
down
with
their
swords
They
will
kill
their
sons
and
daughters
and
burn
their
houses
with
fire
48
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
obscene
conduct
in
the
land
and
all
the
women
will
learn
a
lesson
and
not
copy
your
obscene
conduct
49
They
will
bring
on
you
the
consequences
of
your
obscene
conduct
and
of
your
sins
with
your
disgusting
idols
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
in
the
ninth
year
in
the
tenth
month
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
saying
2
Son
of
man
record
this
date
this
very
day
The
king
of
Babylon
has
begun
his
attack
against
Jerusalem
on
this
very
day
3
And
relate
a
proverb
concerning
the
rebellious
house
and
say
concerning
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Put
the
cooking
pot
on
put
it
on
the
fire
and
pour
water
into
it

4
Put
pieces
of
meat
into
it
every
good
piece
The
thigh
and
the
shoulder
fill
it
with
the
choicest
bones

5
Take
the
choicest
sheep
of
the
flock
and
stack
the
logs
all
around
under
the
pot
Boil
the
pieces
and
cook
the
bones
inside
it
6
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Woe
to
the
city
of
bloodshed
the
rusty
cooking
pot
whose
rust
has
not
been
removed
Empty
it
piece
by
piece
do
not
cast
lots
for
them

7
For
its
blood
is
within
it
she
poured
it
out
on
the
bare
rock
She
did
not
pour
it
out
on
the
earth
to
cover
it
over
with
dust

8
To
stir
up
rage
for
executing
vengeance
I
have
put
her
blood
on
the
shining
bare
rockSo
that
it
may
not
be
covered
over
9
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Woe
to
the
city
of
bloodshed
I
will
pile
the
wood
high
10
Heap
on
the
logs
and
kindle
the
fire
Boil
the
flesh
thoroughly
pour
out
the
broth
and
let
the
bones
be
charred
11
Set
the
empty
pot
on
the
coals
to
make
it
hotSo
that
its
copper
will
become
red
hot
Its
uncleanness
will
melt
away
within
it
and
its
rust
will
be
consumed
12
It
is
frustrating
and
exhausting
For
the
heavy
rust
will
not
come
off
Throw
it
into
the
fire
with
its
rust
13
Your
uncleanness
was
due
to
your
obscene
conduct
I
tried
to
cleanse
you
but
you
would
not
become
clean
from
your
uncleanness
You
will
not
become
clean
until
my
rage
against
you
subsides
14
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
It
will
come
to
pass
I
will
act
without
holding
back
without
sorrow
without
regret
They
will
judge
you
according
to
your
ways
and
your
dealings

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
15
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
16
Son
of
man
in
a
single
blow
I
am
about
to
take
away
your
dear
one
from
you
You
should
not
mourn
nor
should
you
weep
or
shed
tears
17
Groan
in
silence
and
do
not
observe
mourning
rites
for
the
dead
Bind
on
your
turban
and
put
on
your
sandals
You
should
not
cover
over
the
mustache
and
do
not
eat
the
bread
brought
to
you
by
others
18
And
I
spoke
to
the
people
in
the
morning
and
my
wife
died
in
the
evening
So
I
did
in
the
morning
just
as
I
had
been
commanded
19
The
people
were
saying
to
me
Will
you
not
tell
us
what
these
things
you
are
doing
have
to
do
with
us
20
I
replied
to
them
The
word
of
Jehovah
has
come
to
me
saying
21
Tell
the
house
of
Israel
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
am
about
to
profane
my
sanctuary
the
source
of
your
great
pride
the
thing
dear
to
you
and
the
desire
of
your
heart
Your
own
sons
and
daughters
whom
you
left
behind
will
fall
by
the
sword
22
Then
you
will
have
to
do
just
as
I
have
done
You
will
not
cover
over
your
mustache
and
you
will
not
eat
the
bread
brought
to
you
by
others
23
Your
turbans
will
be
on
your
heads
and
your
sandals
on
your
feet
You
will
not
mourn
or
weep
Instead
you
will
rot
away
in
your
errors
and
you
will
groan
to
one
another
24
Ezekiel
has
become
a
sign
for
you
Just
as
he
has
done
you
will
do
When
it
happens
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
25
And
as
for
you
son
of
man
on
the
day
that
I
take
away
from
them
their
fortress—the
beautiful
object
of
their
joy
the
thing
dear
to
them
their
hearts
desire—along
with
their
sons
and
daughters
26
it
will
be
reported
to
you
by
one
who
has
escaped
27
In
that
day
you
will
open
your
mouth
and
speak
to
the
one
who
escaped
and
you
will
no
longer
be
mute
You
will
become
a
sign
to
them
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
turn
your
face
toward
the
Ammonites
and
prophesy
against
them
3
You
must
say
concerning
the
Ammonites
Hear
the
word
of
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
you
said
Aha
against
my
sanctuary
when
it
was
profaned
and
against
the
land
of
Israel
when
it
was
laid
desolate
and
against
the
house
of
Judah
when
they
went
into
exile
4
therefore
I
am
giving
you
to
the
people
of
the
East
as
a
possession
They
will
set
up
their
encampments
within
you
and
pitch
their
tents
among
you
They
will
eat
your
fruitage
and
they
will
drink
your
milk
5
I
will
make
Rabbah
a
pasture
ground
for
camels
and
the
land
of
the
Ammonites
a
resting-place
for
the
flock
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
6
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
you
clapped
your
hands
and
stamped
your
feet
and
you
rejoiced
over
the
land
of
Israel
with
such
utter
scorn
7
therefore
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand
against
you
to
give
you
to
the
nations
as
something
to
plunder
I
will
cut
you
off
from
the
peoples
and
destroy
you
from
the
lands
I
will
annihilate
you
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
8
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
Moab
and
Seir
have
said
Look
The
house
of
Judah
is
like
all
the
other
nations

9
I
am
exposing
Moabs
flank
at
his
frontier
cities
the
beauty
of
his
land
Beth-jeshimoth
Baal-meon
and
clear
to
Kiriathaim
10
I
will
give
it
along
with
the
Ammonites
as
a
possession
to
the
people
of
the
East
so
that
the
Ammonites
will
not
be
remembered
among
the
nations
11
And
I
will
execute
judgment
in
Moab
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
12
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Edom
has
acted
vengefully
against
the
house
of
Judah
and
has
incurred
great
guilt
in
taking
revenge
on
them
13
therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
also
stretch
out
my
hand
against
Edom
and
cut
off
from
it
both
man
and
livestock
and
I
will
make
it
desolate
From
Teman
clear
to
Dedan
they
will
fall
by
the
sword
14
I
will
take
vengeance
on
Edom
by
the
hand
of
my
people
Israel
They
will
bring
my
anger
and
my
wrath
on
Edom
so
that
they
experience
my
own
vengeance

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
15
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
of
their
unrelenting
hostility
the
Philistines
have
maliciously
sought
to
bring
vengeance
and
destruction
16
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
stretching
out
my
hand
against
the
Philistines
and
I
will
cut
off
the
Cherethites
and
will
destroy
the
remaining
inhabitants
of
the
seacoast
17
I
will
execute
on
them
great
acts
of
vengeance
with
furious
punishments
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
bring
my
vengeance
on
them
1
In
the
11th
year
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
because
Tyre
has
said
against
Jerusalem
Aha
The
gateway
of
the
peoples
has
been
broken
Everything
will
come
my
way
and
I
will
become
rich
now
that
she
is
devastated
3
therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
against
you
O
Tyre
and
I
will
bring
up
many
nations
against
you
just
as
the
sea
brings
up
its
waves
4
They
will
destroy
the
walls
of
Tyre
and
tear
down
her
towers
and
I
will
scrape
away
soil
and
make
her
a
shining
bare
rock
5
She
will
become
a
drying
yard
for
dragnets
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
For
I
myself
have
spoken

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
and
she
will
become
plunder
for
the
nations
6
And
her
settlements
in
the
countryside
will
be
slaughtered
by
the
sword
and
people
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
7
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
bringing
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
against
Tyre
from
the
north
he
is
a
king
of
kings
with
horses
war
chariots
cavalrymen
and
an
army
of
many
soldiers
8
He
will
destroy
your
settlements
in
the
countryside
with
the
sword
and
he
will
build
a
siege
wall
and
throw
up
a
siege
rampart
against
you
and
raise
up
a
great
shield
against
you
9
He
will
pound
your
walls
with
his
battering
ram
and
with
his
axes
he
will
pull
down
your
towers
10
His
horses
will
be
so
many
that
they
will
cover
you
with
dust
and
the
sound
of
the
cavalry
the
wheels
and
the
chariots
will
cause
your
walls
to
shake
when
he
enters
your
gates
like
men
storming
a
city
with
broken
walls
11
The
hooves
of
his
horses
will
trample
down
all
your
streets
he
will
kill
your
people
with
the
sword
and
your
mighty
pillars
will
crash
to
the
ground
12
They
will
loot
your
resources
plunder
your
merchandise
tear
down
your
walls
and
pull
down
your
fine
houses
then
they
will
throw
your
stones
and
your
woodwork
and
your
soil
into
the
water
13
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
noise
of
your
songs
and
the
sound
of
your
harps
will
be
heard
no
more
14
And
I
will
make
you
a
shining
bare
rock
and
you
will
become
a
drying
yard
for
dragnets
You
will
never
be
rebuilt
for
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
15
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
to
Tyre
At
the
sound
of
your
downfall
when
the
dying
ones
are
groaning
when
a
slaughter
takes
place
in
your
midst
will
the
islands
not
shudder
16
All
the
princes
of
the
sea
will
come
down
from
their
thrones
and
remove
their
robes
and
strip
off
their
embroidered
garments
and
they
will
be
seized
with
trembling
They
will
sit
on
the
ground
and
tremble
constantly
and
stare
at
you
in
amazement
17
And
they
will
sing
a
dirge
over
you
and
say
to
you
How
you
have
perished
you
who
were
inhabited
from
the
seas
the
praised
city
You
and
your
inhabitants
were
mighty
on
the
sea
Spreading
terror
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
18
The
islands
will
tremble
on
the
day
of
your
downfall
The
islands
of
the
sea
will
be
disturbed
when
you
are
gone
19
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
When
I
devastate
you
like
the
cities
that
are
not
inhabited
when
I
overwhelm
you
with
the
surging
waters
and
the
mighty
waters
have
covered
you
20
I
will
bring
you
and
those
going
down
into
the
pit
with
you
to
the
people
of
long
ago
I
will
cause
you
to
dwell
in
the
lowest
place
like
the
places
of
old
that
have
been
devastated
together
with
those
going
down
into
the
pit
so
that
you
may
not
be
inhabited
Then
I
will
glorify
the
land
of
the
living
21
I
will
bring
sudden
terror
upon
you
and
you
will
no
longer
be
They
will
search
for
you
but
you
will
never
again
be
found

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
As
for
you
son
of
man
sing
a
dirge
over
Tyre
3
and
say
to
Tyre
You
who
dwell
at
the
gateways
of
the
sea
The
merchant
for
the
peoples
of
many
islands
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
O
Tyre
you
yourself
have
said
I
am
perfect
in
beauty

4
Your
territories
are
in
the
heart
of
the
sea
And
your
builders
have
perfected
your
beauty

5
They
made
all
your
planks
from
the
juniper
trees
of
Senir
And
they
took
a
cedar
from
Lebanon
to
make
a
mast
for
you

6
They
made
your
oars
from
oaks
of
Bashan
And
your
prow
was
of
cypress
inlaid
with
ivory
from
the
islands
of
Kittim

7
Colorful
linen
from
Egypt
served
as
cloth
for
your
sail
And
your

awnings
were
of
blue
thread

purple
wool
from

Elishah

25
The
ships
of
Tarshish
were
the
caravans
for
your
merchandise
So
that
you
were
filled
and
loaded
down
in
the
heart
of
the
open
sea
26
Your
rowers
have
brought
you
into
heavy
seas
The
east
wind
has
wrecked
you
in
the
heart
of
the
open
sea
27
Your
wealth
your
goods
your
merchandise
your

multitude
within
you—They
will
all
sink
in
the
heart
of
the
open
sea
on
the
day
of
your
downfall
28
When
your
sailors
cry
out
the
coastlands
will
shudder
29
All
the
oarsmen
the
mariners
and
the
seamenWill
come
down
from
their
ships
and
stand
on
the
land
30
They
will
raise
their
voices
and
cry
out
bitterly
over
youAs
they
throw
dust
on
their
heads
and
wallow
in
ashes
31
They
will
make
themselves
bald
and
put
on
sackcloth
They
will
weep
bitterly
over
you
with
intense
wailing
32
In
their
lamentation
they
will
sing
a
dirge
and
chant
over
you
Who
is
like
Tyre
now
silent
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
33
When
your
goods
came
in
from
the
open
sea
you
satisfied
many
peoples
Your
abundant
wealth
and
your
merchandise
enriched
earths
kings
34
Now
you
have
been
wrecked
in
the
open
sea
in
the
deep
waters
And
all
your
merchandise
and
your
people
have
sunk
with
you
35
All
the
inhabitants
of
the
islands

stare
at
you
in
amazement
And
their
kings
will
shudder
with
horror—their
faces
will
be
troubled
36
The
merchants
among
the
nations
will
whistle
over
what
happened
to
you
Your
end
will
be
sudden
and
terrible
And
you
will
cease
to
exist
for
all
time
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
tell
the
leader
of
Tyre
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
your
heart
has
become
haughty
you
keep
saying
I
am
a
god
I
sit
on
the
throne
of
a
god
in
the
heart
of
the
sea
But
you
are
only
a
man
not
a
god
Though
in
your
heart
you
feel
that
you
are
a
god

3
Look
You
are
wiser
than
Daniel
No
secrets
have
been
hidden
from
you

4
You
have
made
yourself
wealthy
by
your
wisdom
and
your
discernment
And
you
keep
storing
up
gold
and
silver
in
your
treasuries

5
Your
skillful
trading
brought
you
great
wealth
And
your
heart
grew
haughty
because
of
your
wealth
6
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
in
your
heart
you
feel
that
you
are
a
god
7
I
am
bringing
foreigners
against
you
the
most
ruthless
of
the
nations
And
they
will
draw
their
swords
against
the
beauty
of
your
wisdomAnd
defile
your
glorious
splendor

8
They
will
bring
you
down
to
the
pit
And
you
will
die
a
violent
death
in
the
heart
of
the
open
sea

9
Will
you
still
say
I
am
a
god

to
the
one
killing
you
You
will
be
a
mere
man
not
a
god
in
the
hand
of
those
defiling
you
10
By
the
hand
of
foreigners
you
will
die
the
death
of
the
uncircumcised
ones
For
I
myself
have
spoken

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
11
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
12
Son
of
man
sing
a
dirge
concerning
the
king
of
Tyre
and
tell
him
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
You
were
the
model
of
perfection
Full
of
wisdom
and
perfect
in
beauty
13
You
were
in
Eden
the
garden
of
God
You
were
adorned
with
every
precious
stone—Ruby
topaz
and
jasper
chrysolite
onyx
and
jade
sapphire
turquoise
and
emerald
And
their
settings
and
mountings
were
made
of
gold
They
were
prepared
on
the
day
you
were
created
14
I
assigned
you
as
the
anointed
covering
cherub
You
were
on
the
holy
mountain
of
God
and
you
walked
about
among
fiery
stones
15
You
were
faultless
in
your
ways
from
the
day
you
were
createdUntil
unrighteousness
was
found
in
you
16
Because
of
your
abundant
trade
You
became
filled
with
violence
and
you
began
to
sin
So
I
will
cast
you
out
as
profane
from
the
mountain
of
God
and
destroy
you
O
covering
cherub
away
from
the
stones
of
fire
17
Your
heart
became
haughty
because
of
your
beauty
You
corrupted
your
wisdom
because
of
your
own
glorious
splendor
I
will
throw
you
down
to
the
earth
I
will
make
you
a
spectacle
before
kings
18
Because
of
your
great
guilt
and
your
dishonest
trading
you
have
profaned
your
sanctuaries
I
will
cause
a
fire
to
break
out
in
your
midst
and
it
will
consume
you
I
will
reduce
you
to
ashes
on
the
earth
before
all
those
looking
at
you
19
All
who
knew
you
among
the
peoples
will
stare
at
you
in
amazement
Your
end
will
be
sudden
and
terrible
And
you
will
cease
to
exist
for
all
time
20
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
21
Son
of
man
turn
your
face
toward
Sidon
and
prophesy
against
her
22
You
should
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
against
you
O
Sidon
and
I
will
be
glorified
in
your
midst
And
people
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
execute
judgment
on
her
and
I
am
sanctified
in
her
23
I
will
send
pestilence
into
her
and
blood
will
flow
in
her
streets
The
slain
will
fall
in
her
midst
when
the
sword
comes
against
her
from
all
sides
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
24
Then
the
house
of
Israel
will
no
longer
be
surrounded
by
injurious
briars
and
painful
thorns
those
who
treat
them
with
scorn
and
people
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
25
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
When
I
regather
the
house
of
Israel
from
among
the
peoples
where
they
were
scattered
I
will
be
sanctified
among
them
in
the
eyes
of
the
nations
And
they
will
dwell
on
their
land
that
I
gave
to
my
servant
Jacob
26
They
will
dwell
on
it
in
security
and
build
houses
and
plant
vineyards
and
they
will
dwell
in
security
when
I
execute
judgment
on
all
those
around
them
who
treat
them
with
scorn
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
their
God
1
In
the
tenth
year
in
the
tenth
month
on
the
12th
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
turn
your
face
toward
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
prophesy
against
him
and
against
all
Egypt
3
Speak
these
words
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
against
you
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
The
great
sea
monster
lying
among
the
streams
of
his
Nile
Who
has
said
My
Nile
River
belongs
to
me
I
made
it
for
myself

4
But
I
will
put
hooks
in
your
jaws
and
cause
the
fish
of
your
Nile
to
cling
to
your
scales
I
will
bring
you
up
out
of
your
Nile
along
with
all
the
fish
of
the
Nile
that
cling
to
your
scales

5
I
will
abandon
you
in
the
desert
you
and
all
the
fish
of
your
Nile
You
will
fall
on
the
open
field
and
you
will
not
be
gathered
up
nor
be
collected
together
I
will
give
you
as
food
to
the
wild
beasts
of
the
earth
and
the
birds
of
the
sky

6
Then
all
the
inhabitants
of
Egypt
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
For
they
were
no
more
support
to
the
house
of
Israel
than
a
piece
of
straw

7
When
they
grasped
your
hand
you
were
crushed
And
you
caused
them
to
tear
their
shoulder
When
they
supported
themselves
on
you
you
were
broken
And
you
caused
their
legs
to
wobble
8
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
bringing
a
sword
upon
you
and
I
will
cut
off
from
you
both
man
and
beast
9
The
land
of
Egypt
will
become
a
desolate
and
devastated
place
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
for
you
have
said
The
Nile
River
belongs
to
me
I
am
the
one
who
made
it
10
So
I
am
against
you
and
against
your
Nile
and
I
will
make
the
land
of
Egypt
devastated
and
dry
a
desolate
wasteland
from
Migdol
to
Syene
to
the
boundary
of
Ethiopia
11
Neither
man
nor
livestock
will
pass
through
it
on
foot
and
it
will
not
be
inhabited
for
40
years
12
I
will
make
the
land
of
Egypt
the
most
desolate
of
lands
and
its
cities
will
be
the
most
desolate
of
cities
for
40
years
and
I
will
scatter
the
Egyptians
among
the
nations
and
disperse
them
among
the
lands
13
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
After
40
years
I
will
gather
back
the
Egyptians
from
the
peoples
where
they
were
scattered
14
I
will
bring
the
Egyptian
captives
back
to
the
land
of
Pathros
to
the
land
of
their
origin
and
there
they
will
become
an
insignificant
kingdom
15
Egypt
will
become
lower
than
the
other
kingdoms
and
will
no
longer
dominate
the
other
nations
and
I
will
make
them
so
small
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
subdue
other
nations
16
It
will
never
again
be
a
source
of
confidence
for
the
house
of
Israel
but
it
will
only
remind
them
of
their
error
in
turning
to
the
Egyptians
for
help
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
17
Now
in
the
27th
year
in
the
first
month
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
18
Son
of
man
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
made
his
army
labor
greatly
against
Tyre
Every
head
became
bald
and
every
shoulder
was
rubbed
bare
But
he
and
his
army
received
no
wages
for
the
labor
he
expended
on
Tyre
19
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
giving
the
land
of
Egypt
to
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
and
he
will
carry
off
its
wealth
and
take
much
spoil
and
plunder
from
it
and
it
will
become
wages
for
his
army
20
As
compensation
for
his
labor
against
her
I
will
give
him
the
land
of
Egypt
because
they
acted
for
me

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
21
In
that
day
I
will
cause
a
horn
to
sprout
for
the
house
of
Israel
and
I
will
give
you
an
opportunity
to
speak
among
them
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
1
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
prophesy
and
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Wail
Alas
the
day
is
coming

3
For
the
day
is
near
yes
a
day
of
Jehovah
is
near
It
will
be
a
day
of
clouds
an
appointed
time
of
nations

4
A
sword
will
come
against
Egypt
and
panic
will
overtake
Ethiopia
when
the
slain
fall
in
Egypt
Its
wealth
is
taken
and
its
foundations
are
torn
down

5
Ethiopia
Put
Lud
and
all
the
mixed
populations
And
Chub
along
with
the
sons
of
the
land
of
the
covenant
By
the
sword
they
will
all
fall

6
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
The
supporters
of
Egypt
will
also
fall
And
its
arrogant
power
will
be
brought
down
From
Migdol
to
Syene
they
will
fall
by
the
sword
in
the
land

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
7
They
will
be
made
the
most
desolate
of
lands
and
its
own
cities
will
become
the
most
devastated
cities
8
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
set
a
fire
in
Egypt
and
all
its
allies
are
crushed
9
In
that
day
I
will
send
messengers
in
ships
to
make
self-confident
Ethiopia
tremble
panic
will
seize
them
in
the
day
that
is
coming
upon
Egypt
for
it
will
surely
come
10
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
bring
an
end
to
Egypts
hordes
by
the
hand
of
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
11
He
and
his
troops
the
most
ruthless
of
the
nations
will
be
brought
in
to
destroy
the
land
They
will
draw
their
swords
against
Egypt
and
fill
the
land
with
the
slain
12
I
will
turn
the
canals
of
the
Nile
into
dry
ground
and
will
sell
the
land
into
the
hand
of
wicked
men
I
will
make
the
land
and
everything
in
it
desolate
by
the
hand
of
foreigners
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
13
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
also
destroy
the
disgusting
idols
and
bring
an
end
to
the
worthless
gods
of
Noph
There
will
no
longer
be
a
prince
from
the
land
of
Egypt
and
I
will
put
fear
in
the
land
of
Egypt
14
I
will
desolate
Pathros
and
set
a
fire
in
Zoan
and
execute
judgment
on
No
15
I
will
pour
out
my
rage
on
Sin
the
stronghold
of
Egypt
and
destroy
the
population
of
No
16
I
will
set
a
fire
in
Egypt
and
Sin
will
be
seized
with
terror
and
No
will
be
broken
through
and
Noph
will
face
attack
in
broad
daylight
17
The
young
men
of
On
and
Pibeseth
will
fall
by
the
sword
and
the
cities
will
go
into
captivity
18
In
Tehaphnehes
the
day
will
grow
dark
when
I
break
the
yoke
bars
of
Egypt
there
Her
arrogant
power
will
come
to
an
end
clouds
will
cover
her
and
her
towns
will
go
into
captivity
19
I
will
execute
judgment
on
Egypt
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
20
And
in
the
11th
year
in
the
first
month
on
the
seventh
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
21
Son
of
man
I
have
broken
the
arm
of
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
it
will
not
be
bound
up
to
be
healed
or
wrapped
with
a
bandage
to
make
it
strong
enough
to
take
up
the
sword
22
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
against
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
I
will
break
his
arms
the
strong
one
and
the
broken
one
and
I
will
make
the
sword
fall
from
his
hand
23
Then
I
will
scatter
the
Egyptians
among
the
nations
and
disperse
them
among
the
lands
24
I
will
strengthen
the
arms
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
put
my
sword
into
his
hand
and
I
will
break
the
arms
of
Pharaoh
and
he
will
groan
loudly
like
a
dying
man
before
him
25
I
will
strengthen
the
arms
of
the
king
of
Babylon
but
the
arms
of
Pharaoh
will
fall
limp
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
put
my
sword
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
Babylon
and
he
wields
it
against
the
land
of
Egypt
26
And
I
will
scatter
the
Egyptians
among
the
nations
and
disperse
them
among
the
lands
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
1
In
the
11th
year
in
the
third
month
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
say
to
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
to
his
hordes
Whom
are
you
like
in
your
greatness

3
There
was
an
Assyrian
a
cedar
in
Lebanon
With
beautiful
branches
like
a
shady
thicket
lofty
in
stature
Its
top
was
among
the
clouds

4
The
waters
made
it
grow
big
the
deep
springs
of
water
caused
it
to
grow
high
Streams
were
all
around
where
it
was
planted
Their
channels
watered
all
the
trees
of
the
field

5
That
is
why
it
grew
taller
than
all
the
other
trees
of
the
field
Its
boughs
multiplied
and
its
branches
grew
longBecause
of
the
abundant
water
in
its
streams

6
All
the
birds
of
the
sky
nested
in
its
boughs
All
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
gave
birth
under
its
branches
And
all
the
populous
nations
were
dwelling
in
its
shade

7
It
became
majestic
in
beauty
and
in
the
length
of
its
branches
For
its
roots
went
down
into
abundant
waters

8
No
other
cedars
in
the
garden
of
God
could
compare
to
it
None
of
the
juniper
trees
had
boughs
like
it
And
none
of
the
plane
trees
could
match
its
branches
No
other
tree
in
the
garden
of
God
could
rival
its
beauty

9
I
made
it
beautiful
with
abundant
foliage
And
all
the
other
trees
of
Eden
the
garden
of
the
true
God
envied
it
10
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
it
became
so
tall
lifting
its
top
among
the
clouds
and
its
heart
became
arrogant
because
of
its
height
11
I
will
hand
it
over
to
the
mighty
ruler
of
the
nations
He
will
surely
act
against
it
and
I
will
reject
it
for
its
wickedness
12
And
foreigners
the
most
ruthless
of
the
nations
will
cut
it
down
and
they
will
abandon
it
on
the
mountains
and
its
foliage
will
fall
in
all
the
valleys
and
its
branches
will
lie
broken
in
all
the
streams
of
the
land
All
the
peoples
of
the
earth
will
depart
from
its
shade
and
abandon
it
13
All
the
birds
of
the
sky
will
live
on
its
fallen
trunk
and
all
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
on
its
branches
14
This
is
so
that
no
tree
near
the
waters
should
grow
so
tall
or
lift
up
its
top
among
the
clouds
and
that
no
well-watered
tree
may
reach
up
to
them
in
height
For
they
will
all
be
given
over
to
death
to
the
land
down
below
along
with
the
sons
of
mankind
who
are
going
down
into
the
pit
15
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
On
the
day
it
goes
down
to
the
Grave
I
will
cause
a
mourning
Therefore
I
will
cover
over
the
deep
waters
and
hold
back
its
streams
so
that
the
abundant
waters
are
restrained
I
will
darken
Lebanon
because
of
it
and
the
trees
of
the
field
will
all
wither
away
16
At
the
sound
of
its
downfall
I
will
cause
nations
to
shudder
when
I
bring
it
down
to
the
Grave
along
with
all
those
going
down
into
the
pit
and
all
the
trees
of
Eden
the
choicest
and
the
best
of
Lebanon
all
that
are
well-watered
will
be
comforted
in
the
land
down
below
17
They
have
gone
down
to
the
Grave
with
him
to
those
slain
by
the
sword
together
with
his
supporters
who
lived
in
his
shadow
among
the
nations
18
Which
of
the
trees
of
Eden
was
like
you
in
glory
and
greatness
But
you
will
certainly
be
brought
down
with
the
trees
of
Eden
to
the
land
down
below
You
will
lie
down
among
the
uncircumcised
ones
with
those
slain
by
the
sword
This
will
happen
to
Pharaoh
and
all
his
hordes

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
And
in
the
12th
year
in
the
12th
month
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
sing
a
dirge
concerning
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
and
say
to
him
You
were
like
a
strong
young
lion
of
the
nations
But
you
have
been
silenced
You
were
like
a
sea
monster
thrashing
about
in
your
rivers
Muddying
the
waters
with
your
feet
and
fouling
the
rivers

3
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
By
means
of
an
assembly
of
many
nations
I
will
cast
my
net
over
you
And
they
will
haul
you
up
in
my
dragnet

4
I
will
abandon
you
on
the
land
I
will
cast
you
onto
the
open
field
I
will
cause
all
the
birds
of
the
sky
to
settle
on
you
And
I
will
satisfy
the
wild
beasts
of
the
whole
earth
with
you

5
I
will
cast
your
flesh
on
the
mountainsAnd
fill
the
valleys
with
your
remains

6
I
will
drench
the
land
with
your
gushing
blood
up
to
the
mountains
And
it
will
fill
the
streams

7
And
when
you
are
extinguished
I
will
cover
the
heavens
and
darken
their
stars
I
will
cover
the
sun
with
clouds
And
the
moon
will
not
give
its
light

8
I
will
darken
all
the
shining
luminaries
in
the
heavens
because
of
you
And
I
will
cover
your
land
with
darkness

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah

9
I
will
distress
the
hearts
of
many
peoples
when
I
lead
your
captives
to
other
nations
To
lands
that
you
have
not
known
10
I
will
cause
many
peoples
to
be
awestruck
And
their
kings
will
shudder
in
horror
over
you
when
I
brandish
my
sword
before
them
They
will
tremble
continually
each
fearing
for
his
life
On
the
day
of
your
downfall
11
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
The
sword
of
the
king
of
Babylon
will
come
upon
you
12
I
will
cause
your
hordes
to
fall
by
the
swords
of
mighty
warriors
The
most
ruthless
of
the
nations
all
of
them
They
will
bring
down
the
pride
of
Egypt
and
all
her
hordes
will
be
annihilated
13
I
will
destroy
all
her
livestock
beside
her
abundant
waters
And
no
foot
of
a
human
or
hoof
of
the
livestock
will
muddy
them
again
14
At
that
time
I
will
clear
up
their
waters
And
I
will
make
their
rivers
flow
like
oil

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
15
When
I
make
Egypt
a
desolate
wasteland
a
land
stripped
of
all
that
filled
it
When
I
strike
down
all
the
inhabitants
in
it
They
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
16
This
is
a
dirge
and
people
will
certainly
chant
it
The
daughters
of
the
nations
will
chant
it
They
will
chant
it
over
Egypt
and
over
all
its
hordes

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
17
Then
in
the
12th
year
on
the
15th
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
18
Son
of
man
wail
over
the
hordes
of
Egypt
and
bring
her
down
to
the
land
below
her
and
the
daughters
of
mighty
nations
with
those
going
down
into
the
pit
19
Whom
do
you
surpass
in
beauty
Go
down
and
lie
with
the
uncircumcised
ones
20
They
will
fall
among
those
slain
by
the
sword
She
has
been
given
to
the
sword
drag
her
away
along
with
all
her
hordes
21
From
the
depths
of
the
Grave
the
mightiest
warriors
will
speak
to
him
and
his
helpers
They
will
certainly
go
down
and
will
lie
just
like
the
uncircumcised
slain
by
the
sword
22
Assyria
is
there
with
all
her
assembly
Their
graves
are
all
around
him
all
of
them
fallen
by
the
sword
23
Her
graves
are
in
the
depths
of
the
pit
and
her
assembly
is
all
around
her
grave
all
of
them
struck
down
by
the
sword
because
they
caused
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living
24
Elam
is
there
with
all
her
hordes
around
her
grave
all
of
them
fallen
by
the
sword
They
have
gone
down
uncircumcised
to
the
land
below
those
who
caused
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living
Now
they
will
bear
their
shame
with
those
going
down
into
the
pit
25
They
have
made
a
bed
for
her
among
the
slain
along
with
all
her
hordes
around
her
graves
All
of
them
are
uncircumcised
slain
by
the
sword
because
they
caused
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
they
will
bear
their
shame
with
those
going
down
into
the
pit
He
has
been
put
among
the
slain
26
There
is
where
Meshech
and
Tubal
and
all
their
hordes
are
Her
graves
are
all
around
him
All
of
them
are
uncircumcised
pierced
through
by
the
sword
because
they
caused
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living
27
Will
they
not
lie
with
mighty
uncircumcised
warriors
who
have
fallen
who
went
down
to
the
Grave
with
their
weapons
of
war
And
they
will
put
their
swords
under
their
heads
and
their
sins
on
their
bones
because
these
mighty
warriors
terrorized
the
land
of
the
living
28
But
as
for
you
you
will
be
crushed
among
the
uncircumcised
ones
and
you
will
lie
with
those
who
were
slain
by
the
sword
29
Edom
is
there
her
kings
and
all
her
chieftains
who
despite
their
mightiness
were
laid
among
those
slain
by
the
sword
they
too
will
lie
with
the
uncircumcised
ones
and
with
those
going
down
into
the
pit
30
There
all
the
princes
of
the
north
are
along
with
all
the
Sidonians
who
have
gone
down
in
disgrace
with
the
slain
despite
the
terror
caused
by
their
mightiness
They
will
lie
uncircumcised
with
those
who
were
slain
by
the
sword
and
will
bear
their
shame
with
those
going
down
into
the
pit
31
Pharaoh
will
see
all
of
these
and
he
will
be
comforted
over
all
that
happened
to
his
hordes
Pharaoh
and
all
his
army
will
be
slain
by
the
sword

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
32
Because
he
caused
terror
in
the
land
of
the
living
Pharaoh
and
all
his
hordes
will
be
laid
to
rest
with
the
uncircumcised
with
those
slain
by
the
sword

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
speak
to
the
sons
of
your
people
and
say
to
them
Suppose
that
I
bring
a
sword
upon
a
land
and
all
the
people
of
that
land
take
a
man
and
make
him
their
watchman
3
and
he
sees
the
sword
coming
upon
the
land
and
blows
the
horn
and
warns
the
people
4
If
someone
hears
the
sound
of
the
horn
but
does
not
heed
the
warning
and
a
sword
comes
and
takes
his
life
his
blood
will
be
on
his
own
head
5
He
heard
the
sound
of
the
horn
but
he
did
not
heed
the
warning
His
blood
will
be
upon
himself
If
he
had
heeded
the
warning
his
life
would
have
been
saved
6
But
if
the
watchman
sees
the
sword
coming
and
he
does
not
blow
the
horn
and
the
people
receive
no
warning
and
a
sword
comes
and
takes
the
life
of
one
of
them
that
person
will
die
for
his
own
error
but
I
will
ask
his
blood
back
from
the
watchman
7
As
for
you
son
of
man
I
have
appointed
you
as
a
watchman
to
the
house
of
Israel
and
when
you
hear
a
word
from
my
mouth
you
must
warn
them
from
me
8
When
I
say
to
someone
wicked
Wicked
one
you
will
surely
die
but
you
do
not
speak
out
to
warn
the
wicked
one
to
change
his
course
he
will
die
as
a
wicked
man
because
of
his
own
error
but
I
will
ask
his
blood
back
from
you
9
But
if
you
warn
someone
wicked
to
turn
back
from
his
way
and
he
refuses
to
change
his
course
he
will
die
for
his
error
but
you
will
certainly
save
your
own
life
10
And
you
son
of
man
say
to
the
house
of
Israel
You
have
said
Our
revolts
and
our
sins
weigh
heavily
upon
us
causing
us
to
waste
away
so
how
will
we
keep
living
11
Tell
them
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
I
take
no
pleasure
in
the
death
of
the
wicked
but
rather
that
someone
wicked
changes
his
way
and
keeps
living
Turn
back
turn
back
from
your
bad
ways
for
why
should
you
die
O
house
of
Israel
12
And
you
son
of
man
tell
the
sons
of
your
people
The
righteousness
of
the
righteous
man
will
not
save
him
when
he
revolts
nor
will
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
man
make
him
stumble
when
he
turns
away
from
his
wickedness
nor
will
anyone
righteous
be
able
to
keep
living
because
of
his
righteousness
in
the
day
that
he
sins
13
When
I
say
to
the
righteous
one
You
will
surely
keep
living

and
he
trusts
in
his
own
righteousness
and
does
what
is
wrong
none
of
his
righteous
acts
will
be
remembered
but
he
will
die
for
the
wrong
that
he
has
done
14
And
when
I
say
to
the
wicked
one
You
will
surely
die

and
he
turns
away
from
his
sin
and
does
what
is
just
and
righteous
15
and
the
wicked
one
returns
what
was
taken
in
pledge
and
pays
back
what
was
taken
by
robbery
and
he
walks
in
the
statutes
of
life
by
not
doing
what
is
wrong
he
will
surely
keep
living
He
will
not
die
16
None
of
the
sins
he
committed
will
be
held
against
him
For
doing
what
is
just
and
righteous
he
will
surely
keep
living
17
But
your
people
have
said
The
way
of
Jehovah
is
unjust

when
it
is
actually
their
way
that
is
unjust
18
When
someone
righteous
abandons
his
righteousness
and
does
what
is
wrong
he
must
die
for
it
19
But
when
someone
wicked
turns
away
from
his
wickedness
and
does
what
is
just
and
righteous
he
will
keep
living
for
doing
so
20
But
you
have
said
The
way
of
Jehovah
is
unjust
I
will
judge
each
of
you
according
to
his
ways
O
house
of
Israel
21
At
length
in
the
12th
year
in
the
tenth
month
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
month
of
our
exile
a
man
who
had
escaped
from
Jerusalem
came
to
me
and
said
The
city
has
been
struck
down
22
Now
the
evening
before
the
escaped
man
came
the
hand
of
Jehovah
had
come
upon
me
and
he
had
opened
my
mouth
before
the
man
came
to
me
in
the
morning
So
my
mouth
was
opened
and
I
was
no
longer
speechless
23
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
me
saying
24
Son
of
man
the
inhabitants
of
these
ruins
are
saying
concerning
the
land
of
Israel
Abraham
was
just
one
man
and
yet
he
took
possession
of
the
land
But
we
are
many
surely
the
land
has
been
given
to
us
as
a
possession
25
Therefore
say
to
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
You
are
eating
food
with
the
blood
and
you
lift
up
your
eyes
to
your
disgusting
idols
and
you
keep
shedding
blood
So
why
should
you
possess
the
land
26
You
have
relied
on
your
sword
you
engage
in
detestable
practices
and
each
of
you
has
defiled
his
neighbors
wife
So
why
should
you
possess
the
land
27
This
is
what
you
should
say
to
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
As
surely
as
I
am
alive
those
living
in
the
ruins
will
fall
by
the
sword
those
in
the
open
field
I
will
give
as
food
to
the
wild
beasts
and
those
in
the
strongholds
and
the
caves
will
die
by
disease
28
I
will
make
the
land
an
utterly
desolate
wasteland
and
its
arrogant
pride
will
be
brought
to
an
end
and
the
mountains
of
Israel
will
be
desolated
with
no
one
passing
through
29
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
make
the
land
an
utterly
desolate
wasteland
because
of
all
the
detestable
things
that
they
have
done
30
As
for
you
son
of
man
your
people
are
speaking
with
one
another
about
you
beside
the
walls
and
in
the
doorways
of
the
houses
They
are
saying
to
each
other
each
to
his
brother
Come
and
let
us
hear
the
word
that
comes
from
Jehovah
31
They
will
crowd
in
to
sit
before
you
as
my
people
and
they
will
hear
your
words
but
they
will
not
do
them
For
with
their
mouth
they
flatter
you
but
their
heart
is
greedy
for
dishonest
gain
32
Look
You
are
to
them
like
a
romantic
love
song
sung
with
a
beautiful
voice
and
skillfully
played
on
a
stringed
instrument
They
will
hear
your
words
but
no
one
will
act
on
them
33
And
when
it
comes
true—and
it
will
come
true—they
will
have
to
know
that
a
prophet
has
been
among
them
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
prophesy
against
the
shepherds
of
Israel
Prophesy
and
say
to
the
shepherds
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Woe
to
the
shepherds
of
Israel
who
have
been
feeding
themselves
Is
it
not
the
flock
that
the
shepherds
should
feed
3
You
eat
the
fat
you
clothe
yourselves
with
the
wool
and
you
slaughter
the
fattest
animal
but
you
do
not
feed
the
flock
4
You
have
not
strengthened
the
weak
or
healed
the
sick
or
bandaged
the
injured
or
brought
back
the
strays
or
looked
for
the
lost
rather
you
have
ruled
them
with
harshness
and
tyranny
5
So
they
were
scattered
because
there
was
no
shepherd
they
were
scattered
and
became
food
for
every
wild
beast
of
the
field
6
My
sheep
were
straying
on
all
the
mountains
and
on
every
high
hill
my
sheep
were
scattered
over
all
the
surface
of
the
earth
with
no
one
searching
for
them
or
seeking
to
find
them
7
Therefore
you
shepherds
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
8
As
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
because
my
sheep
have
become
prey
food
for
every
wild
beast
of
the
field
for
there
was
no
shepherd
and
my
shepherds
did
not
search
for
my
sheep
rather
they
kept
feeding
themselves
and
did
not
feed
my
sheep

9
therefore
you
shepherds
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
10
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
am
against
the
shepherds
and
I
will
demand
an
accounting
of
them
for
my
sheep
and
I
will
dismiss
them
from
feeding
my
sheep
and
the
shepherds
will
no
longer
feed
themselves
I
will
rescue
my
sheep
from
their
mouth
and
they
will
no
longer
be
food
for
them
11
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
and
I
myself
will
search
for
my
sheep
and
I
will
care
for
them
12
I
will
care
for
my
sheep
like
a
shepherd
who
has
found
his
scattered
sheep
and
is
feeding
them
I
will
rescue
them
from
all
the
places
where
they
were
scattered
in
the
day
of
clouds
and
thick
gloom
13
I
will
bring
them
out
from
the
peoples
and
collect
them
together
from
the
lands
and
bring
them
into
their
land
and
feed
them
on
the
mountains
of
Israel
by
the
streams
and
by
all
the
dwelling
places
of
the
land
14
In
a
good
pasture
I
will
feed
them
and
the
land
where
they
graze
will
be
on
Israels
high
mountains
They
will
lie
down
there
in
a
good
grazing
land
and
they
will
feed
on
choice
pastures
on
the
mountains
of
Israel
15
I
myself
will
feed
my
sheep
and
I
myself
will
make
them
lie
down

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
16
The
lost
one
I
will
search
for
the
stray
I
will
bring
back
the
injured
I
will
bandage
and
the
weak
I
will
strengthen
but
the
fat
one
and
the
strong
one
I
will
annihilate
I
will
feed
that
one
with
judgment
17
As
for
you
my
sheep
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
am
about
to
judge
between
one
sheep
and
another
sheep
between
the
rams
and
the
male
goats
18
Is
it
not
enough
for
you
to
feed
on
the
very
best
pastures
Must
you
also
trample
the
rest
of
your
pastures
with
your
feet
And
after
drinking
the
clearest
water
must
you
foul
the
water
by
stamping
with
your
feet
19
Should
my
sheep
now
feed
on
the
pasture
trampled
by
your
feet
and
drink
the
water
befouled
by
the
stamping
of
your
feet
20
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
to
them
Here
I
am
and
I
myself
will
judge
between
a
fat
sheep
and
a
lean
sheep
21
for
with
your
flank
and
shoulder
you
kept
pushing
and
with
your
horns
you
kept
shoving
all
the
sick
ones
until
you
had
scattered
them
abroad
22
And
I
will
save
my
sheep
and
they
will
no
longer
become
something
to
prey
upon
and
I
will
judge
between
a
sheep
and
a
sheep
23
I
will
raise
up
one
shepherd
over
them
my
servant
David
and
he
will
feed
them
He
himself
will
feed
them
and
become
their
shepherd
24
And
I
Jehovah
will
become
their
God
and
my
servant
David
a
chieftain
among
them
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
25
And
I
will
make
a
covenant
of
peace
with
them
and
I
will
rid
the
land
of
vicious
wild
beasts
so
that
they
may
dwell
securely
in
the
wilderness
and
sleep
in
the
forests
26
I
will
make
them
and
the
area
around
my
hill
a
blessing
and
I
will
cause
the
rain
to
fall
at
the
proper
time
Blessings
will
pour
down
like
the
rains
27
The
trees
of
the
field
will
yield
their
fruit
and
the
soil
will
give
its
produce
and
they
will
dwell
securely
on
the
land
And
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
break
their
yoke
bars
and
rescue
them
from
those
who
enslaved
them
28
They
will
no
longer
become
something
for
the
nations
to
prey
upon
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
earth
will
not
devour
them
and
they
will
dwell
in
security
with
no
one
to
make
them
afraid
29
I
will
establish
for
them
a
plantation
of
fame
and
they
will
no
longer
die
from
famine
in
the
land
and
they
will
no
longer
be
humiliated
by
the
nations
30
Then
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
Jehovah
their
God
am
with
them
and
that
they
the
house
of
Israel
are
my
people

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
31
As
for
you
my
sheep
the
sheep
that
I
care
for
you
are
but
men
and
I
am
your
God

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
turn
your
face
toward
the
mountainous
region
of
Seir
and
prophesy
against
it
3
Say
to
it
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
against
you
O
mountainous
region
of
Seir
and
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand
against
you
and
make
you
a
desolate
wasteland
4
I
will
turn
your
cities
into
ruins
and
you
will
become
a
desolate
wasteland
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
5
For
you
showed
unrelenting
hostility
and
you
gave
the
Israelites
over
to
the
sword
at
the
time
of
their
disaster
at
the
time
of
their
final
punishment
6
Therefore
as
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
I
will
prepare
you
for
bloodshed
and
bloodshed
will
pursue
you
Since
it
was
blood
that
you
hated
bloodshed
will
pursue
you
7
I
will
make
the
mountainous
region
of
Seir
a
desolate
wasteland
and
I
will
cut
off
from
it
anyone
passing
through
and
anyone
returning
8
I
will
fill
its
mountains
with
the
slain
and
those
slain
by
the
sword
will
fall
on
your
hills
in
your
valleys
and
in
all
your
streams
9
I
will
make
you
a
perpetual
desolation
and
your
cities
will
not
be
inhabited
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
10
Because
you
said
These
two
nations
and
these
two
lands
will
become
mine
and
we
will
take
possession
of
both

even
though
Jehovah
himself
was
there
11
therefore
as
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
I
will
deal
with
you
according
to
the
same
anger
and
jealousy
that
you
displayed
in
your
hatred
toward
them
and
I
will
make
myself
known
among
them
when
I
judge
you
12
You
will
then
have
to
know
that
I
myself
Jehovah
have
heard
all
the
insolent
things
you
spoke
against
the
mountains
of
Israel
when
you
said
They
have
been
laid
desolate
and
have
been
given
to
us
to
devour
13
And
you
spoke
arrogantly
against
me
and
you
multiplied
your
words
against
me
I
heard
it
all
14
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
The
whole
earth
will
rejoice
when
I
will
make
you
a
desolate
wasteland
15
Just
as
you
rejoiced
when
the
inheritance
of
the
house
of
Israel
was
laid
desolate
that
is
how
I
will
deal
with
you
You
will
become
a
desolate
ruin
O
mountainous
region
of
Seir
yes
all
of
Edom
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
1
As
for
you
son
of
man
prophesy
about
the
mountains
of
Israel
and
say
O
mountains
of
Israel
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
2
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
The
enemy
has
said
against
you
Aha
Even
the
ancient
high
places
have
become
our
possession
3
So
prophesy
and
say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
they
have
desolated
and
attacked
you
from
every
direction
so
that
you
would
become
a
possession
of
the
survivors
from
among
the
nations
and
people
keep
talking
about
you
and
slandering
you
4
therefore
O
mountains
of
Israel
hear
the
word
of
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
to
the
mountains
and
the
hills
to
the
streams
and
the
valleys
to
the
ruins
that
were
desolated
and
to
the
abandoned
cities
that
have
been
plundered
and
ridiculed
by
the
survivors
of
the
nations
around
them
5
to
these
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
In
the
fire
of
my
zeal
I
will
speak
against
the
survivors
of
the
nations
and
against
all
Edom
those
who
with
great
rejoicing
and
utter
scorn
have
claimed
my
land
as
their
own
possession
to
take
over
its
pastures
and
to
plunder
it
6
So
prophesy
concerning
the
land
of
Israel
and
say
to
the
mountains
and
to
the
hills
to
the
streams
and
to
the
valleys
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Look
I
will
speak
in
my
zeal
and
in
my
rage
because
you
have
borne
humiliation
by
the
nations
7
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
myself
raise
my
hand
in
an
oath
that
the
surrounding
nations
will
themselves
bear
their
own
shame
8
But
you
O
mountains
of
Israel
will
produce
branches
and
bear
your
fruitage
for
my
people
Israel
for
they
will
soon
return
9
For
I
am
with
you
and
I
will
turn
toward
you
and
you
will
be
cultivated
and
sown
with
seed
10
I
will
multiply
your
people—the
whole
house
of
Israel
all
of
it—and
the
cities
will
be
inhabited
and
the
ruins
will
be
rebuilt
11
Yes
I
will
multiply
your
people
and
your
livestock
they
will
increase
and
be
fruitful
And
I
will
cause
you
to
be
inhabited
as
you
were
formerly
and
I
will
make
you
prosper
more
than
in
the
past
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
12
I
will
cause
people—my
people
Israel—to
walk
upon
you
and
they
will
take
possession
of
you
You
will
become
their
inheritance
and
you
will
never
again
make
them
childless
13
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Because
they
are
saying
to
you
You
are
a
land
that
devours
people
and
bereaves
your
nations
of
children

14
therefore
you
will
no
longer
devour
people
or
make
your
nations
childless

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
15
I
will
not
subject
you
to
any
more
insults
of
the
nations
or
make
you
bear
the
taunts
of
people
and
you
will
no
longer
cause
your
nations
to
stumble

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
16
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
17
Son
of
man
when
the
house
of
Israel
was
dwelling
in
their
land
they
made
it
unclean
by
their
ways
and
their
dealings
Their
ways
were
like
the
uncleanness
of
menstruation
to
me
18
So
I
poured
out
my
rage
on
them
because
of
the
blood
that
they
had
shed
upon
the
land
and
because
they
made
the
land
unclean
with
their
disgusting
idols
19
So
I
scattered
them
among
the
nations
and
dispersed
them
among
the
lands
I
judged
them
according
to
their
way
and
according
to
their
dealings
20
But
when
they
came
to
those
nations
people
profaned
my
holy
name
by
saying
about
them
These
are
the
people
of
Jehovah
but
they
had
to
leave
his
land
21
So
I
will
show
concern
for
my
holy
name
which
the
house
of
Israel
profaned
among
the
nations
where
they
have
gone
22
Therefore
say
to
the
house
of
Israel
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Not
for
your
sakes
am
I
acting
O
house
of
Israel
but
for
my
holy
name
which
you
profaned
among
the
nations
where
you
have
gone
23
I
will
certainly
sanctify
my
great
name
which
was
profaned
among
the
nations
which
you
profaned
among
them
and
the
nations
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
when
I
am
sanctified
among
you
before
their
eyes
24
I
will
take
you
from
the
nations
and
gather
you
back
from
all
the
lands
and
bring
you
into
your
land
25
I
will
sprinkle
clean
water
on
you
and
you
will
become
clean
I
will
cleanse
you
from
all
your
uncleanness
and
from
all
your
disgusting
idols
26
I
will
give
you
a
new
heart
and
put
a
new
spirit
inside
you
I
will
remove
the
heart
of
stone
from
your
body
and
give
you
a
heart
of
flesh
27
I
will
put
my
spirit
inside
you
and
I
will
cause
you
to
walk
in
my
regulations
and
you
will
observe
and
carry
out
my
judicial
decisions
28
Then
you
will
dwell
in
the
land
that
I
gave
to
your
forefathers
and
you
will
be
my
people
and
I
will
be
your
God
29
I
will
save
you
from
all
your
uncleanness
and
summon
the
grain
and
make
it
abound
and
I
will
not
bring
famine
upon
you
30
I
will
make
the
fruitage
of
the
tree
and
the
produce
of
the
field
abound
so
that
you
may
never
again
suffer
the
disgrace
of
famine
among
the
nations
31
Then
you
will
remember
your
evil
ways
and
your
deeds
that
were
not
good
and
you
will
loathe
yourselves
because
of
your
guilt
and
your
detestable
practices
32
But
know
this
I
am
not
doing
this
for
your
sakes

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Instead
be
ashamed
and
feel
humiliated
because
of
your
ways
O
house
of
Israel
33
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
In
the
day
that
I
cleanse
you
from
all
your
guilt
I
will
cause
the
cities
to
be
inhabited
and
the
ruins
to
be
rebuilt
34
The
desolate
land
that
was
lying
desolate
for
everyone
passing
by
to
see
will
be
cultivated
35
And
people
will
say
The
desolate
land
has
become
like
the
garden
of
Eden
and
the
cities
that
were
in
ruins
and
desolate
and
torn
down
are
now
fortified
and
inhabited
36
And
the
nations
that
are
left
remaining
around
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
myself
Jehovah
have
built
what
was
torn
down
and
I
have
planted
what
was
desolate
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
and
I
have
done
it
37
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
also
let
the
house
of
Israel
ask
me
to
do
this
for
them
I
will
multiply
their
people
like
a
flock
38
Like
the
flock
of
holy
ones
like
the
flock
of
Jerusalem
during
her
festivals
the
cities
that
were
in
ruins
will
become
full
of
flocks
of
people
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
1
The
hand
of
Jehovah
was
upon
me
and
by
his
spirit
Jehovah
took
me
and
set
me
down
in
the
middle
of
the
valley
plain
and
it
was
full
of
bones
2
He
had
me
pass
all
around
them
and
I
saw
that
there
were
very
many
bones
lying
in
the
valley
plain
and
they
were
very
dry
3
He
asked
me
Son
of
man
can
these
bones
come
to
life
To
that
I
said
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
you
are
the
one
who
knows
4
So
he
said
to
me
Prophesy
over
these
bones
and
say
to
them
You
dry
bones
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
5
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
to
these
bones
I
will
cause
breath
to
enter
you
and
you
will
come
to
life
6
I
will
put
sinews
and
flesh
on
you
and
I
will
cover
you
with
skin
and
put
breath
in
you
and
you
will
come
to
life
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
7
Then
I
prophesied
just
as
I
had
been
commanded
As
soon
as
I
prophesied
there
was
a
noise
a
rattling
sound
and
the
bones
began
to
come
together
bone
to
bone
8
Then
I
saw
sinews
and
flesh
come
on
them
and
skin
covered
over
them
But
there
was
still
no
breath
in
them
9
He
then
said
to
me
Prophesy
to
the
wind
Prophesy
son
of
man
and
say
to
the
wind
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
From
the
four
winds
come
in
O
wind
and
blow
upon
these
people
who
were
killed
so
that
they
may
come
to
life
10
So
I
prophesied
just
as
he
commanded
me
and
breath
came
into
them
and
they
began
to
live
and
to
stand
on
their
feet
an
extremely
large
army
11
Then
he
said
to
me
Son
of
man
these
bones
are
the
whole
house
of
Israel
Here
they
are
saying
Our
bones
are
dry
and
our
hope
has
perished
We
are
completely
cut
off
12
So
prophesy
and
say
to
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
open
your
graves
and
raise
you
up
from
your
graves
my
people
and
bring
you
to
the
land
of
Israel
13
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
when
I
open
your
graves
and
when
I
raise
you
up
out
of
your
graves
O
my
people
14
I
will
put
my
spirit
in
you
and
you
will
come
to
life
and
I
will
settle
you
on
your
land
and
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
myself
Jehovah
have
spoken
and
I
have
done
it

declares
Jehovah
15
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
16
And
you
son
of
man
take
a
stick
and
write
on
it
For
Judah
and
for
the
people
of
Israel
who
are
with
him
Then
take
another
stick
and
write
on
it
For
Joseph
the
stick
of
Ephraim
and
all
the
house
of
Israel
who
are
with
him
17
Then
bring
them
close
to
each
other
so
that
they
become
just
one
stick
in
your
hand
18
When
your
people
say
to
you
Will
you
not
tell
us
what
these
things
mean
19
tell
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
take
the
stick
of
Joseph
which
is
in
the
hand
of
Ephraim
and
the
tribes
of
Israel
who
are
with
him
and
I
will
join
them
to
the
stick
of
Judah
and
I
will
make
them
one
stick
and
they
will
become
one
in
my
hand
20
The
sticks
that
you
write
on
should
be
in
your
hand
for
them
to
see
21
Then
tell
them
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
take
the
Israelites
from
among
the
nations
where
they
have
gone
and
I
will
collect
them
together
from
every
direction
and
bring
them
to
their
land
22
I
will
make
them
one
nation
in
the
land
on
the
mountains
of
Israel
and
one
king
will
rule
over
all
of
them
and
they
will
no
longer
be
two
nations
nor
will
they
be
divided
any
longer
into
two
kingdoms
23
They
will
no
longer
defile
themselves
with
their
disgusting
idols
and
their
detestable
practices
and
all
their
transgressions
I
will
save
them
from
all
their
unfaithfulness
by
which
they
have
sinned
and
I
will
cleanse
them
They
will
be
my
people
and
I
myself
will
be
their
God
24
My
servant
David
will
be
their
king
and
they
will
all
have
one
shepherd
They
will
walk
in
my
judicial
decisions
and
carefully
observe
my
statutes
25
They
will
dwell
on
the
land
that
I
gave
to
my
servant
to
Jacob
where
your
forefathers
lived
and
they
will
dwell
on
it
forever
they
and
their
children
and
their
childrens
children
and
David
my
servant
will
be
their
chieftain
forever
26
And
I
will
make
a
covenant
of
peace
with
them
it
will
be
an
eternal
covenant
with
them
I
will
establish
them
and
make
them
many
and
place
my
sanctuary
among
them
forever
27
My
tent
will
be
with
them
and
I
will
be
their
God
and
they
will
be
my
people
28
And
the
nations
will
have
to
know
that
I
Jehovah
am
sanctifying
Israel
when
my
sanctuary
is
in
their
midst
forever
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
2
Son
of
man
set
your
face
against
Gog
of
the
land
of
Magog
the
head
chieftain
of
Meshech
and
Tubal
and
prophesy
against
him
3
Say
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
against
you
O
Gog
head
chieftain
of
Meshech
and
Tubal
4
I
will
turn
you
around
and
put
hooks
in
your
jaws
and
bring
you
out
with
all
your
army
horses
and
horsemen
all
of
them
clothed
in
splendor
a
vast
assembly
with
large
shields
and
bucklers
all
of
them
wielding
swords
5
Persia
Ethiopia
and
Put
are
with
them
all
of
them
with
buckler
and
helmet
6
Gomer
and
all
its
troops
the
house
of
Togarmah
from
the
remotest
parts
of
the
north
along
with
all
its
troops—many
peoples
are
with
you
7
Be
ready
prepare
yourselves
you
with
all
your
armies
that
are
assembled
with
you
and
you
will
be
their
commander
8
You
will
be
given
attention
after
many
days
In
the
final
part
of
the
years
you
will
invade
the
land
whose
people
have
been
restored
from
the
ravages
of
the
sword
collected
together
out
of
many
peoples
onto
the
mountains
of
Israel
which
had
long
been
lying
devastated
The
inhabitants
of
this
land
were
restored
from
the
peoples
and
all
of
them
dwell
in
security
9
You
will
come
against
them
like
a
storm
and
you
will
cover
the
land
like
clouds
you
and
all
your
troops
and
many
peoples
with
you
10
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
In
that
day
thoughts
will
come
into
your
heart
and
you
will
devise
an
evil
plan
11
You
will
say
I
will
invade
the
land
of
unprotected
settlements
I
will
come
against
those
living
in
security
without
disturbance
all
of
them
living
in
settlements
unprotected
by
walls
bars
or
gates
12
It
will
be
to
take
much
spoil
and
plunder
to
attack
the
devastated
places
that
are
now
inhabited
and
a
people
regathered
from
the
nations
who
are
accumulating
wealth
and
property
those
who
are
living
in
the
center
of
the
earth
13
Sheba
and
Dedan
the
merchants
of
Tarshish
and
all
its
warriors
will
say
to
you
Are
you
invading
to
get
much
spoil
and
plunder
Have
you
assembled
your
armies
to
carry
off
silver
and
gold
to
take
wealth
and
property
to
seize
a
very
great
spoil
14
So
prophesy
son
of
man
and
say
to
Gog
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
On
that
day
when
my
people
Israel
are
dwelling
in
security
will
you
not
know
it
15
You
will
come
from
your
place
from
the
remotest
parts
of
the
north
you
and
many
peoples
with
you
all
of
them
riding
on
horses
a
great
assembly
a
vast
army
16
Like
clouds
covering
the
land
you
will
come
against
my
people
Israel
In
the
final
part
of
the
days
I
will
bring
you
against
my
land
so
that
the
nations
may
know
me
when
I
sanctify
myself
through
you
before
their
eyes
O
Gog
17
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Are
you
not
the
same
one
I
spoke
about
in
the
former
days
through
my
servants
the
prophets
of
Israel
who
prophesied
for
many
years
that
you
would
be
brought
against
them
18
On
that
day
the
day
when
Gog
invades
the
land
of
Israel

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
my
great
rage
will
flare
up
19
In
my
zeal
in
the
fire
of
my
fury
I
will
speak
and
in
that
day
there
will
be
a
great
earthquake
in
the
land
of
Israel
20
Because
of
me
the
fish
of
the
sea
the
birds
of
the
sky
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
all
the
reptiles
that
creep
on
the
ground
and
all
humans
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
will
tremble
and
the
mountains
will
be
thrown
down
and
the
cliffs
will
fall
and
every
wall
will
collapse
to
the
ground
21
I
will
call
for
a
sword
against
him
on
all
my
mountains

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
Every
mans
sword
will
be
against
his
own
brother
22
I
will
bring
my
judgment
against
him
with
pestilence
and
bloodshed
and
I
will
rain
down
a
torrential
downpour
and
hailstones
and
fire
and
sulfur
on
him
and
on
his
troops
and
on
the
many
peoples
with
him
23
And
I
will
certainly
magnify
myself
and
sanctify
myself
and
make
myself
known
before
the
eyes
of
many
nations
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
1
And
you
son
of
man
prophesy
against
Gog
and
tell
him
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
am
against
you
Gog
head
chieftain
of
Meshech
and
Tubal
2
I
will
turn
you
around
and
lead
you
and
make
you
come
up
from
the
remotest
parts
of
the
north
and
bring
you
in
upon
the
mountains
of
Israel
3
I
will
knock
your
bow
out
of
your
left
hand
and
make
your
arrows
fall
from
your
right
hand
4
On
the
mountains
of
Israel
you
will
fall
you
and
all
your
troops
and
the
peoples
who
will
be
with
you
I
will
give
you
as
food
to
all
kinds
of
birds
of
prey
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
5
You
will
fall
on
the
open
field
for
I
myself
have
spoken

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
6
And
I
will
send
fire
against
Magog
and
against
those
who
are
inhabiting
the
islands
in
security
and
they
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
7
I
will
make
my
holy
name
known
among
my
people
Israel
and
I
will
not
allow
my
holy
name
to
be
profaned
any
longer
and
the
nations
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
the
Holy
One
in
Israel
8
Yes
this
is
coming
and
it
will
be
done

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
This
is
the
day
I
have
spoken
about
9
The
inhabitants
of
the
cities
of
Israel
will
go
out
and
make
fires
with
the
weapons—the
bucklers
and
shields
the
bows
and
arrows
the
war
clubs
and
lances
And
they
will
use
them
to
light
fires
for
seven
years
10
They
will
not
need
to
take
wood
from
the
field
or
gather
firewood
from
the
forests
because
they
will
use
the
weapons
to
light
fires
They
will
take
spoil
from
those
who
despoiled
them
and
plunder
from
those
who
had
been
plundering
them

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
11
On
that
day
I
will
give
Gog
a
burial
place
there
in
Israel
in
the
valley
of
those
who
travel
east
of
the
sea
and
it
will
block
the
path
of
those
passing
through
That
is
where
they
will
bury
Gog
and
all
his
hordes
and
they
will
call
it
the
Valley
of
Hamon-Gog
12
The
house
of
Israel
will
spend
seven
months
burying
them
in
order
to
cleanse
the
land
13
All
the
people
of
the
land
will
work
at
burying
them
and
this
will
bring
them
fame
in
the
day
that
I
glorify
myself

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
14
Men
will
be
assigned
to
pass
through
the
land
constantly
and
bury
the
bodies
left
remaining
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
in
order
to
cleanse
it
They
will
continue
the
search
for
seven
months
15
When
those
who
pass
through
the
land
see
a
human
bone
they
will
set
up
a
marker
beside
it
Then
those
assigned
to
do
the
burying
will
bury
it
in
the
Valley
of
Hamon-Gog
16
And
there
will
also
be
a
city
there
named
Hamonah
And
they
will
cleanse
the
land
17
As
for
you
son
of
man
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
Say
to
every
sort
of
bird
and
to
all
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
Gather
yourselves
together
and
come
Gather
all
around
my
sacrifice
that
I
am
preparing
for
you
a
great
sacrifice
on
the
mountains
of
Israel
You
will
eat
flesh
and
drink
blood
18
You
will
eat
the
flesh
of
mighty
ones
and
drink
the
blood
of
the
chieftains
of
the
earth—the
rams
lambs
goats
and
bulls—all
the
fattened
animals
of
Bashan
19
You
will
gorge
yourselves
on
fat
and
drink
blood
until
you
are
drunk
from
the
sacrifice
that
I
prepare
for
you
20
At
my
table
you
will
be
filled
up
with
horses
and
charioteers
mighty
ones
and
all
sorts
of
warriors

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
21
I
will
display
my
glory
among
the
nations
and
all
the
nations
will
see
the
judgment
that
I
have
executed
and
the
power
that
I
have
demonstrated
among
them
22
From
that
day
on
the
house
of
Israel
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
their
God
23
And
the
nations
will
have
to
know
that
the
house
of
Israel
went
into
exile
because
of
their
own
error
because
they
were
unfaithful
to
me
So
I
hid
my
face
from
them
and
handed
them
over
to
their
enemies
and
they
all
fell
by
the
sword
24
I
dealt
with
them
according
to
their
uncleanness
and
their
transgressions
and
I
hid
my
face
from
them
25
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
I
will
restore
the
captives
of
Jacob
and
have
mercy
on
the
whole
house
of
Israel
and
I
will
zealously
defend
my
holy
name
26
After
they
have
been
humiliated
for
all
their
unfaithfulness
toward
me
they
will
dwell
securely
on
their
land
with
no
one
to
make
them
afraid
27
When
I
bring
them
back
from
the
peoples
and
collect
them
together
from
the
lands
of
their
enemies
I
will
also
sanctify
myself
among
them
before
the
eyes
of
many
nations
28
They
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
their
God
when
I
send
them
into
exile
among
the
nations
and
then
gather
them
back
to
their
land
not
leaving
any
of
them
behind
29
I
will
not
hide
my
face
from
them
any
longer
for
I
will
pour
out
my
spirit
on
the
house
of
Israel

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
In
the
25th
year
of
our
exile
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
in
the
14th
year
after
the
city
had
fallen
on
that
very
day
the
hand
of
Jehovah
was
upon
me
and
he
took
me
to
the
city
2
By
means
of
visions
from
God
he
brought
me
to
the
land
of
Israel
and
set
me
down
on
a
very
high
mountain
on
which
there
was
a
structure
like
a
city
to
the
south
3
When
he
brought
me
there
I
saw
a
man
whose
appearance
was
like
that
of
copper
He
had
a
flax
cord
and
a
measuring
reed
in
his
hand
and
he
was
standing
in
the
gateway
4
The
man
said
to
me
Son
of
man
look
closely
listen
carefully
and
pay
attention
to
everything
I
show
you
for
that
is
why
you
were
brought
here
Tell
the
house
of
Israel
everything
that
you
see
5
I
saw
a
wall
surrounding
the
outside
of
the
temple
In
the
mans
hand
was
a
measuring
reed
six
cubits
long
to
each
cubit
a
handbreadth
was
added
He
began
to
measure
the
wall
and
its
thickness
was
one
reed
and
its
height
was
one
reed
6
Then
he
came
to
the
gate
that
faced
east
and
climbed
its
steps
When
he
measured
the
threshold
of
the
gate
its
width
was
one
reed
and
the
width
of
the
other
threshold
was
also
one
reed
7
Each
guard
chamber
was
one
reed
long
and
one
reed
wide
and
there
were
five
cubits
between
the
guard
chambers
The
threshold
of
the
gate
beside
the
porch
of
the
gate
facing
the
interior
measured
one
reed
8
He
measured
the
porch
of
the
gate
toward
the
interior
and
it
was
one
reed
9
He
then
measured
the
porch
of
the
gate
which
was
eight
cubits
and
he
measured
its
side
pillars
which
were
two
cubits
and
the
porch
of
the
gate
was
on
the
side
facing
the
interior
10
There
were
three
guard
chambers
on
each
side
of
the
east
gate
The
three
were
the
same
size
and
the
side
pillars
on
either
side
were
the
same
size
11
Then
he
measured
the
width
of
the
entrance
of
the
gate
which
was
10
cubits
and
the
length
of
the
gate
was
13
cubits
12
The
partitioned
area
in
front
of
the
guard
chambers
on
either
side
was
one
cubit
The
guard
chambers
on
both
sides
were
six
cubits
each
13
He
then
measured
the
gate
from
the
roof
of
the
one
guard
chamber
to
the
roof
of
the
other
and
it
was
25
cubits
wide
one
entrance
was
across
from
the
other
entrance
14
Then
he
measured
the
side
pillars
which
were
60
cubits
tall
as
well
as
the
side
pillars
in
the
gates
all
around
the
courtyard
15
From
the
front
of
the
entrance
of
the
gate
to
the
front
of
the
porch
on
the
inner
side
of
the
gate
was
50
cubits
16
There
were
windows
with
narrowing
frames
for
the
guard
chambers
and
for
their
side
pillars
inside
the
gate
on
each
side
The
interior
of
the
porches
also
had
windows
on
each

there
were
palm-tree

17
He
then
brought
me
into
the

and
I
saw
dining
rooms
and
a
pavement
around
the
courtyard
There
were
30
dining
rooms
on
the
pavement
18
The
pavement
at
the
side
of
the
gates
corresponded
to
the
length
of
the
gates—this
was
the
lower

He
measured
the
distance
from
gate
to
gate
and
it
was
100
cubits
24
Next
he
brought
me
toward
the
south
and
I
saw
a

measured
southward
from
gate
to
gate
and
the
distance
was
100

28
Next
he
brought
me
into
the
inner
courtyard
through
the
south
gate

it
was
the

and
there
were
palm-tree

on
both
of
its

led
up
to
it
35
He
then
brought
me
into
the

and
measured
it
it
was
the

the
whole
burnt
offerings
were
washed
39
There

were
two
tables
outside
the

There
were
also
two
tables
on
the

of
the
porch
of
the
gate
41
There
were
four
tables
on
each
side
of
the
gate—eight
tables
in
all—on
which
the
sacrifices
were
slaughtered
42
The

were
attached
all
around
the
interior
walls
and
the
flesh
of
the
gift
offerings
would
be
placed
on

44
Outside

were
the
dining

for
the
singers
they
were
in
the
inner

near
the
north
gate
facing

Another
dining
room
was
near
the

45
He
said
to
me
This
dining
room
that
faces
south
is
for
the
priests
who
are
responsible
for
the
services
in
the
temple
46
The
dining
room
that
faces

is
for
the
priests
who
are
responsible
for
the
service
of
the
altar
They
are
the
sons
of
Zadok
those
from
the
Levites
who
are
assigned
to
approach
Jehovah
to
minister
to
him
47
Then
he
measured
the
inner
courtyard
It
was
100
cubits
long
and
100
cubits
wide
foursquare
The
altar
was
in
front
of
the
temple
48
Then
he
brought
me
into
the
porch
of
the
temple
and
he
measured
the
side
pillar
of
the
porch
and
it
was
five
cubits
on
one
side
and
five
cubits
on
the
other
side
The
width

People
would
reach
it
by
climbing
the
steps
There
were
pillars
by
the
side
posts
one
on

1
Then
he
brought
me
into
the
outer
sanctuary
and
he
measured
the
side
pillars
they
were
six
cubits
wide
on
one
side

which
was
40
cubits
and
its

20
cubits
3
He
then
went
inside
and
measured
the

and
it
was
two
cubits
thick
and
the
entrance
was
six
cubits

4
Next
he
measured
the
room
facing
the
outer
sanctuary
and
it
was
20
cubits
long
and
20
cubits

And
he
said
to

the
Most
Holy
5
Then
he
measured
the
wall
of
the
temple
and
it
was
six
cubits
thick
The
side
chambers
around
the
temple
were
four
cubits
wide
6
The
side
chambers
were
three
stories
high
one
on
top
of
the
other
with
30
chambers
on
each
story
There
were
ledges
around
the
wall
of
the
temple
that
served
as
supports
for
the
side
chambers
so
that
the
supports
did
not
go
into
the
wall
of
the
temple
itself
7
On
both
sides
of
the
temple
was
a
winding
passage
that
widened
as
it
ascended
to
the
upper
chambers
The
width
increased
from
story
to
story
as
one
ascended
from
the
lowest
story
to
the
uppermost
story
by
passing
through
the
middle
story
8
I
saw
that
there
was
a
raised
platform
all
around
the
temple
and
the
foundations
of
the
side
chambers
measured
a
full
reed
of
six
cubits
to
the
corner
9
The
width
of
the
outside
wall
of
the
side
chambers
was
five
cubits
There
was
an
open
space
alongside
the
structure
of
the
side
chambers
that
was
part
of
the
temple
10
Between
the
temple
and
the
dining
rooms
was
an
area
that
was
20
cubits
wide
on
each
side
11
There
was
an
entrance
between
the
side
chambers
and
the
open
space
on
the
north
side
and
another
entrance
on
the
south
side
The
width
of
the
open
space
was
five
cubits
all
around
12
The
building
that
was
on
the
west
facing
the
open
area
was
70
cubits
wide
and
90
cubits
long
the
wall
of
the
building
was
five
cubits
thick
all
around
13
He
measured
the
temple
and
it
was
100
cubits
long
The
open
area
the
building
and
its
walls
were
also
100
cubits
long
14
The
width
of
the
front
of
the
temple
facing
east
and
the
open
area
was
100
cubits
15
He
measured
the
length
of
the
building
that
faced
the
open
area
in
the
rear
along
with
its
galleries
on
both
sides
and
it
was
100
cubits
He
also
measured
the
outer
sanctuary
the
inner
sanctuary
and
the
porches
of
the
courtyard
16
as
well
as
the
thresholds
the
windows
with
narrowing
frames
and
the
galleries
that
were
in
those
three
areas
Near
the
threshold
were
wood
panels
from
the
floor
up
to
the
windows
and
the
windows
were
covered
17
Measurements
were
taken
above
the
entrance
and
in
the
inner
temple
and
on
the
outside
and
on
the
entire
wall
all
around
18
It
had
carved
cherubs
and
palm-tree
figures
with
each
palm
tree
between
two
cherubs
and
each
cherub
had
two
faces
19
The
human
face
was
toward
the
palm
tree
on
one
side
and
the
face
of
a
lion
was
toward
the
palm
tree
on
the
other
side
They
were
carved
this
way
throughout
the
entire
temple
20
From
the
floor
to
the
area
above
the
entrance
were
carved
cherubs
and
palm-tree
figures
on
the
wall
of
the
sanctuary
21
The
doorposts
of
the
sanctuary
were
square
In
front
of
the
holy
place
was
something
like
22
a
wooden
altar
that
was
three
cubits
high
and
two
cubits
long
It
had
corner
posts
and
its
base
and
its
sides
were
made
of
wood
He
then
said
to
me
This
is
the
table
that
is
before
Jehovah
23
The
outer
sanctuary
and
the
holy
place
each
had
two
doors
24
The
doors
had
two
swinging
leaves
two
leaves
for
each
door
25
There
were
carved
cherubs
and
palm-tree
figures
on
the
doors
of
the
sanctuary
like
those
on
the
walls
There
was
also
a
wooden
overhang
on
the
front
of
the
porch
on
the
outside
26
There
were
also
windows
with
narrowing
frames
and
palm-tree
figures
along
both
sides
of
the
porch
as
well
as
along
the
side
chambers
of
the
temple
and
the
overhangs
1
Then
he
led
me
to
the
outer
courtyard
toward
the
north
And
he
brought
me
to
the
dining-room
block
that
was
next
to
the
open
area
north
of
the
adjoining
building
2
Its
length
at
the
north
entrance
was
100
cubits
and
it
was
50
cubits
wide
3
It
was
located
between
the
inner
courtyard
which
was
20
cubits
wide
and
the
pavement
of
the
outer
courtyard
Its
galleries
faced
each
other
and
were
three
stories
high
4
Before
the
dining
rooms
was
an
inner
walkway
10
cubits
wide
and
100
cubits
long
and
their
entrances
were
to
the
north
5
The
upper
dining
rooms
of
the
building
were
narrower
than
those
in
the
lower
and
middle
stories
because
the
galleries
took
up
more
of
their
space
6
For
they
were
three
stories
high
but
they
had
no
pillars
like
the
pillars
of
the
courtyards
That
is
why
more
floor
space
was
taken
away
from
them
than
from
the
lower
and
middle
stories
7
The
outer
stone
wall
near
the
dining
rooms
toward
the
outer
courtyard
that
faced
the
other
dining
rooms
was
50
cubits
long
8
For
the
length
of
the
dining
rooms
that
were
toward
the
outer
courtyard
was
50
cubits
but
for
those
facing
the
sanctuary
it
was
100
cubits
9
The
dining
rooms
had
an
entryway
on
the
east
side
leading
up
to
them
from
the
outer
courtyard
10
There
were
also
dining
rooms
inside
the
stone
wall
of
the
courtyard
toward
the
east
near
the
open
area
and
the
building
11
There
was
a
walkway
before
them
like
that
of
the
northern
dining
rooms
They
were
the
same
length
and
width
and
they
had
the
same
exits
and
layouts
Their
entrances
12
were
like
the
entrances
of
the
dining
rooms
that
were
toward
the
south
There
was
an
entrance
at
the
beginning
of
the
walkway
before
the
adjacent
stone
wall
toward
the
east
where
one
could
enter
13
Then
he
said
to
me
The
dining
rooms
of
the
north
and
the
dining
rooms
of
the
south
that
are
next
to
the
open
area
are
the
holy
dining
rooms
where
the
priests
who
are
approaching
Jehovah
eat
the
most
holy
offerings
There
they
place
the
most
holy
offerings
the
grain
offering
the
sin
offering
and
the
guilt
offering
because
the
place
is
holy
14
When
the
priests
enter
they
should
not
go
out
of
the
holy
place
to
the
outer
courtyard
without
first
removing
the
garments
in
which
they
minister
for
these
are
holy
They
will
clothe
themselves
with
other
garments
in
order
to
approach
the
areas
permitted
to
the
people
15
When
he
finished
measuring
the
inner
temple
area
he
led
me
out
by
way
of
the
gate
that
faces
east
and
he
measured
the
entire
area
16
He
measured
the
eastern
side
with
the
measuring
reed
According
to
the
measuring
reed
it
was
500
reed
lengths
from
one
side
to
the
other
17
He
measured
the
northern
side
and
according
to
the
measuring
reed
it
was
500
reed
lengths
18
He
measured
the
southern
side
and
according
to
the
measuring
reed
it
was
500
reed
lengths
19
He
went
around
to
the
western
side
He
measured
500
reed
lengths
with
the
measuring
reed
20
He
measured
it
on
the
four
sides
It
had
a
wall
all
around
it
that
was
500
reeds
long
and
500
reeds
wide
to
make
a
division
between
what
is
holy
and
what
is
for
common
use
1
Then
he
led
me
to
the
gate
that
is
facing
east
2
There
I
saw
the
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
coming
from
the
east
and
his
voice
was
like
the
sound
of
rushing
waters
and
the
earth
was
illuminated
by
his
glory
3
What
I
saw
was
like
the
vision
I
had
seen
when
I
came
to
bring
the
city
to
ruin
and
it
appeared
to
be
like
what
I
had
seen
near
the
river
Chebar
and
I
fell
with
my
face
to
the
ground
4
Then
the
glory
of
Jehovah
entered
the
temple
through
the
gate
facing
the
east
5
A
spirit
then
raised
me
up
and
brought
me
into
the
inner
courtyard
and
I
saw
that
the
temple
had
become
full
of
the
glory
of
Jehovah
6
Then
I
heard
someone
speaking
to
me
out
of
the
temple
and
the
man
came
and
stood
beside
me
7
He
said
to
me
Son
of
man
this
is
the
place
of
my
throne
and
the
place
for
the
soles
of
my
feet
where
I
will
dwell
among
the
people
of
Israel
forever
The
house
of
Israel
will
no
longer
defile
my
holy
name
they
and
their
kings
by
their
spiritual
prostitution
and
by
the
carcasses
of
their
kings
at
their
death
8
By
putting
their
threshold
next
to
my
threshold
and
their
doorpost
beside
my
doorpost
with
only
a
wall
between
me
and
them
they
defiled
my
holy
name
by
the
detestable
things
they
did
so
I
exterminated
them
in
my
anger
9
Now
let
them
put
their
spiritual
prostitution
and
the
carcasses
of
their
kings
far
away
from
me
and
I
will
dwell
among
them
forever
10
As
for
you
son
of
man
describe
the
temple
to
the
house
of
Israel
so
that
they
will
feel
ashamed
because
of
their
errors
and
they
should
study
its
plan
11
If
they
feel
ashamed
of
all
they
have
done
you
should
make
known
to
them
the
ground
plan
of
the
temple
its
arrangement
its
exits
and
its
entrances
Show
them
all
its
ground
plans
and
its
statutes
its
ground
plans
and
its
laws
and
write
them
down
before
their
eyes
so
that
they
may
observe
all
its
ground
plan
and
carry
out
its
statutes
12
This
is
the
law
of
the
temple
The
entire
territory
all
around
the
top
of
the
mountain
is
most
holy
Look
This
is
the
law
of
the
temple
13
These
are
the
measurements
of
the
altar
in
cubits
to
each
cubit
a
handbreadth
was
added
Its
base
is
a
cubit
and
it
is
a
cubit
wide
It
has
a
border
all
around
the
edge
that
is
one
span
in
width
This
is
the
base
of
the
altar
14
From
the
base
on
the
floor
to
the
lower
surrounding
ledge
is
two
cubits
and
its
width
is
one
cubit
From
the
small
surrounding
ledge
to
the
big
surrounding
ledge
is
four
cubits
and
its
width
is
a
cubit
15
The
altar
hearth
is
four
cubits
high
and
projecting
up
from
the
altar
hearth
are
the
four
horns
16
The
altar
hearth
is
square
12
cubits
long
and
12
cubits
wide
17
The
four
sides
of
the
surrounding
ledge
are
14
cubits
long
and
14
cubits
wide
and
the
surrounding
border
is
half
a
cubit
and
its
base
is
a
cubit
on
all
sides
And
its
steps
are
facing
east
18
He
then
said
to
me
Son
of
man
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
These
are
the
directions
to
follow
when
the
altar
is
made
so
that
whole
burnt
offerings
may
be
offered
and
blood
may
be
sprinkled
on
it
19
You
are
to
give
a
young
bull
of
the
herd
as
a
sin
offering
to
the
Levitical
priests
of
the
offspring
of
Zadok
who
approach
me
to
minister
to
me

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
20
You
should
take
some
of
its
blood
and
put
it
on
the
four
horns
of
the
altar
on
the
four
corners
of
the
surrounding
ledge
and
on
the
border
all
around
in
order
to
purify
it
from
sin
and
to
make
atonement
for
it
21
Then
take
the
young
bull
the
sin
offering
in
order
to
burn
it
in
the
appointed
place
of
the
temple
outside
the
sanctuary
22
On
the
second
day
you
will
offer
a
sound
male
goat
as
a
sin
offering
and
they
will
purify
the
altar
from
sin
just
as
they
purified
it
from
sin
with
the
young
bull
23
When
you
finish
purifying
it
from
sin
you
will
offer
a
sound
young
bull
of
the
herd
and
a
sound
ram
from
the
flock
24
You
are
to
present
them
to
Jehovah
and
the
priests
must
throw
salt
on
them
and
offer
them
up
as
a
whole
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
25
For
seven
days
you
will
offer
a
male
goat
as
a
daily
sin
offering
as
well
as
a
young
bull
of
the
herd
and
a
ram
of
the
flock
you
will
offer
unblemished
animals
26
For
seven
days
they
are
to
make
atonement
for
the
altar
and
they
must
cleanse
it
and
install
it
27
When
the
days
are
completed
on
the
eighth
day
and
thereafter
the
priests
will
offer
your
whole
burnt
offerings
and
communion
sacrifices
on
the
altar
and
I
will
find
pleasure
in
you

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
1
He
brought
me
back
by
way
of
the
outer
gate
of
the
sanctuary
facing
east
and
it
was
shut
2
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
This
gate
will
remain
shut
It
is
not
to
be
opened
and
no
human
will
enter
by
it
for
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
has
entered
through
it
so
it
must
remain
shut
3
However
the
chieftain
will
sit
in
it
to
eat
bread
before
Jehovah
for
he
is
a
chieftain
He
will
come
in
through
the
porch
of
the
gate
and
he
will
go
out
through
it
4
Then
he
brought
me
through
the
north
gate
to
the
front
of
the
temple
When
I
looked
I
saw
that
the
glory
of
Jehovah
had
filled
the
temple
of
Jehovah
So
I
fell
with
my
face
to
the
ground
5
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
Son
of
man
pay
attention
watch
and
listen
carefully
to
everything
I
tell
you
about
the
statutes
and
the
laws
of
the
temple
of
Jehovah
Pay
close
attention
to
the
entryway
of
the
temple
and
all
the
exits
of
the
sanctuary
6
You
must
say
to
the
rebellious
house
of
Israel
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
That
is
enough
of
your
detestable
practices
O
house
of
Israel
7
When
you
bring
foreigners
who
are
uncircumcised
in
heart
and
flesh
into
my
sanctuary
they
profane
my
temple
You
present
my
bread
fat
and
blood
while
my
covenant
is
being
broken
because
of
all
your
detestable
practices
8
You
have
not
taken
care
of
my
holy
things
Instead
you
assign
others
to
take
care
of
the
duties
in
my
sanctuary
9
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
No
foreigner
living
in
Israel
who
is
uncircumcised
in
heart
and
in
flesh
may
enter
my
sanctuary
10
But
the
Levites
who
strayed
far
from
me
when
Israel
strayed
from
me
to
follow
their
disgusting
idols
will
bear
the
consequences
of
their
error
11
And
they
will
become
ministers
in
my
sanctuary
to
oversee
the
gates
of
the
temple
and
to
minister
at
the
temple
They
will
slaughter
the
whole
burnt
offering
and
the
sacrifice
for
the
people
and
they
will
stand
before
the
people
to
minister
to
them
12
Because
they
ministered
to
them
before
their
disgusting
idols
and
became
a
stumbling
block
causing
the
house
of
Israel
to
sin
that
is
why
I
have
raised
my
hand
against
them
in
an
oath

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
and
they
will
bear
the
consequences
of
their
error
13
They
will
not
approach
me
to
serve
as
my
priests
or
approach
any
of
my
holy
or
most
holy
things
and
they
will
bear
their
shame
because
of
the
detestable
things
that
they
did
14
But
I
will
make
them
caretakers
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
temple
to
take
care
of
its
service
and
all
the
things
that
should
be
done
in
it
15
As
for
the
Levitical
priests
the
sons
of
Zadok
who
took
care
of
the
responsibilities
of
my
sanctuary
when
the
Israelites
strayed
from
me
they
will
approach
me
to
minister
to
me
and
they
will
stand
before
me
to
offer
me
the
fat
and
the
blood

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
16
They
are
the
ones
who
will
enter
my
sanctuary
and
they
will
approach
my
table
to
minister
to
me
and
they
will
take
care
of
their
responsibilities
to
me
17
When
they
come
into
the
gates
of
the
inner
courtyard
they
should
wear
linen
garments
They
should
not
wear
any
wool
when
they
minister
in
the
gates
of
the
inner
courtyard
or
inside
it
18
They
should
wear
linen
turbans
on
their
head
and
linen
shorts
should
cover
their
hips
They
should
not
wear
anything
that
makes
them
perspire
19
Before
they
go
out
to
the
outer
courtyard—the
outer
courtyard
where
the
people
are—they
should
remove
the
garments
they
were
ministering
in
and
place
them
in
the
holy
dining
rooms
Then
they
will
put
on
other
garments
so
that
they
will
not
transmit
holiness
to
the
people
with
their
garments
20
They
should
not
shave
their
head
or
let
the
hair
of
their
head
grow
long
They
should
trim
the
hair
of
their
heads
21
The
priests
should
not
drink
wine
when
they
enter
the
inner
courtyard
22
They
should
not
take
a
widow
or
a
divorced
woman
as
a
wife
but
they
may
marry
either
a
virgin
of
the
offspring
of
Israel
or
the
widow
of
a
priest
23
They
should
instruct
my
people
about
the
difference
between
what
is
holy
and
what
is
common
and
they
will
teach
them
the
difference
between
what
is
unclean
and
what
is
clean
24
They
should
preside
as
judges
in
a
legal
case
they
must
judge
it
in
harmony
with
my
judicial
decisions
They
should
keep
my
laws
and
my
statutes
regarding
all
my
festivals
and
sanctify
my
sabbaths
25
They
should
not
approach
any
dead
human
or
they
will
become
unclean
However
they
may
make
themselves
unclean
for
their
father
mother
son
daughter
brother
or
an
unmarried
sister
26
And
after
the
purification
of
a
priest
they
should
count
off
seven
days
for
him
27
On
the
day
he
enters
into
the
holy
place
into
the
inner
courtyard
to
minister
in
the
holy
place
he
should
present
his
sin
offering

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
28
And
this
will
be
their
inheritance
I
am
their
inheritance
You
should
not
give
them
any
possession
in
Israel
for
I
am
their
possession
29
They
will
be
the
ones
to
eat
the
grain
offering
the
sin
offering
and
the
guilt
offering
and
every
devoted
thing
in
Israel
will
become
theirs
30
The
choicest
of
all
the
first
ripe
fruits
and
every
sort
of
contribution
from
you
will
belong
to
the
priests
And
you
should
give
the
firstfruits
of
your
coarse
meal
to
the
priest
This
will
cause
a
blessing
to
rest
on
your
households
31
The
priests
should
not
eat
any
bird
or
animal
that
was
found
dead
or
torn
to
pieces
1
When
you
allot
the
land
as
an
inheritance
you
should
offer
as
a
contribution
to
Jehovah
a
holy
portion
out
of
the
land
Its
length
should
be
25000
cubits
and
its
width
10000
cubits
Its
entire
area
will
be
a
holy
portion
2
Within
this
will
be
a
square
lot
for
the
holy
place
measuring
500
cubits
by
500
cubits
and
it
will
have
50
cubits
as
pastures
on
each
side
3
Out
of
this
measurement
you
should
measure
the
length
of
25000
and
the
width
of
10000
and
within
it
will
be
the
sanctuary
something
most
holy
4
It
will
be
a
holy
portion
of
the
land
for
the
priests
the
ministers
of
the
sanctuary
who
approach
to
minister
to
Jehovah
It
will
be
a
place
for
their
houses
and
a
sacred
place
for
the
sanctuary
5
For
the
Levites
the
ministers
of
the
temple
there
will
be
a
portion
25000
cubits
long
and
10000
cubits
wide
and
they
will
have
20
dining
rooms
as
a
possession
6
You
should
give
the
possession
of
the
city
an
area
that
is
25000
cubits
long
corresponding
to
the
holy
contribution
and
5000
cubits
wide
It
will
belong
to
all
the
house
of
Israel
7
And
for
the
chieftain
there
will
be
land
on
both
sides
of
the
holy
contribution
and
of
the
area
allotted
to
the
city
It
will
be
next
to
the
holy
contribution
and
the
possession
of
the
city
It
will
be
on
the
west
side
and
on
the
east
side
Its
length
from
the
western
boundary
to
the
eastern
boundary
will
correspond
to
one
of
the
tribal
portions
8
This
land
will
become
his
possession
in
Israel
My
chieftains
will
no
longer
mistreat
my
people
and
they
will
give
the
land
to
the
house
of
Israel
according
to
their
tribes
9
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
You
have
gone
far
enough
chieftains
of
Israel
Put
an
end
to
your
violence
and
oppression
and
do
what
is
just
and
righteous
Stop
seizing
the
property
of
my
people

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
10
You
should
use
accurate
scales
an
accurate
ephah
measure
and
an
accurate
bath
measure
11
There
should
be
a
fixed
measurement
for
the
ephah
measure
and
the
bath
measure
The
bath
measure
should
hold
a
tenth
of
a
homer
and
the
ephah
measure
should
hold
a
tenth
of
a
homer
The
homer
will
be
the
standard
for
measuring
12
The
shekel
is
to
be
20
gerahs
And
20
shekels
plus
25
shekels
plus
15
shekels
will
make
up
one
maneh
for
you
13
This
is
the
contribution
that
you
should
offer
one
sixth
of
an
ephah
from
each
homer
of
wheat
and
one
sixth
of
an
ephah
from
each
homer
of
barley
14
The
allowance
of
the
oil
is
to
be
based
on
the
bath
measure
The
bath
is
a
tenth
of
a
cor
and
ten
baths
are
a
homer
for
ten
baths
equal
a
homer
15
And
from
the
flock
of
the
livestock
of
Israel
one
sheep
out
of
every
200
should
be
given
These
will
be
for
the
grain
offering
the
whole
burnt
offering
and
the
communion
sacrifices
in
order
to
make
atonement
for
the
people

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
16
All
the
people
of
the
land
will
make
this
contribution
to
the
chieftain
in
Israel
17
But
the
chieftain
will
be
responsible
for
the
whole
burnt
offerings
the
grain
offering
and
the
drink
offering
during
the
festivals
the
new
moons
the
Sabbaths
and
all
the
designated
festivals
of
the
house
of
Israel
He
will
be
the
one
to
provide
the
sin
offering
the
grain
offering
the
whole
burnt
offering
and
the
communion
sacrifices
in
order
to
make
atonement
in
behalf
of
the
house
of
Israel
18
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
In
the
first
month
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
you
should
take
a
sound
young
bull
of
the
herd
and
you
are
to
purify
the
sanctuary
from
sin
19
The
priest
will
take
some
of
the
blood
of
the
sin
offering
and
put
it
on
the
doorpost
of
the
temple
on
the
four
corners
of
the
surrounding
ledge
of
the
altar
and
on
the
doorpost
of
the
gate
of
the
inner
courtyard
20
That
is
what
you
will
do
on
the
seventh
day
of
the
month
because
of
anyone
who
sins
by
mistake
or
through
ignorance
and
you
are
to
make
atonement
for
the
temple
21
In
the
first
month
on
the
14th
day
of
the
month
you
will
observe
the
festival
of
the
Passover
For
seven
days
unleavened
bread
should
be
eaten
22
On
that
day
the
chieftain
will
provide
a
young
bull
as
a
sin
offering
in
his
own
behalf
and
in
behalf
of
all
the
people
of
the
land
23
For
the
seven
days
of
the
festival
he
will
provide
as
a
whole
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
seven
sound
young
bulls
and
seven
sound
rams
each
of
the
seven
days
as
well
as
a
male
goat
each
day
as
a
sin
offering
24
He
should
also
provide
as
a
grain
offering
an
ephah
for
each
young
bull
and
an
ephah
for
each
ram
as
well
as
a
hin
of
oil
for
each
ephah
25
In
the
seventh
month
on
the
15th
day
of
the
month
for
seven
days
during
the
festival
he
should
provide
the
same
sin
offering
whole
burnt
offering
grain
offering
and
oil
1
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
The
gate
of
the
inner
courtyard
that
is
facing
east
should
remain
shut
for
the
six
workdays
but
on
the
Sabbath
day
and
on
the
day
of
the
new
moon
it
should
be
opened
2
The
chieftain
will
enter
from
outside
by
way
of
the
porch
of
the
gate
and
he
will
stand
by
the
doorpost
of
the
gate
The
priests
will
offer
his
whole
burnt
offering
and
his
communion
sacrifices
and
he
will
bow
down
at
the
threshold
of
the
gate
and
then
go
out
But
the
gate
should
not
be
shut
until
the
evening
3
The
people
of
the
land
will
also
bow
down
before
Jehovah
at
the
entrance
of
that
gate
on
the
Sabbaths
and
on
the
new
moons
4
The
whole
burnt
offering
that
the
chieftain
will
present
to
Jehovah
on
the
Sabbath
day
should
consist
of
six
sound
male
lambs
and
a
sound
ram
5
The
grain
offering
will
be
an
ephah
for
the
ram
and
whatever
he
is
able
to
give
for
the
male
lambs
along
with
a
hin
of
oil
with
each
ephah
6
On
the
day
of
the
new
moon
the
offering
will
consist
of
a
sound
young
bull
of
the
herd
six
male
lambs
and
a
ram
they
should
be
sound
ones
7
He
should
offer
as
a
grain
offering
an
ephah
for
the
young
bull
an
ephah
for
the
ram
and
whatever
he
can
afford
for
the
male
lambs
And
he
should
offer
a
hin
of
oil
with
each
ephah
8
When
the
chieftain
enters
he
should
enter
by
way
of
the
porch
of
the
gate
and
he
should
go
out
the
same
way
9
And
when
the
people
of
the
land
come
in
before
Jehovah
during
the
festivals
those
who
come
in
to
worship
through
the
north
gate
should
go
out
through
the
south
gate
and
those
who
come
in
through
the
south
gate
should
go
out
through
the
north
gate
No
one
should
go
back
by
way
of
the
gate
through
which
he
entered
for
they
should
exit
through
the
gate
that
is
opposite
them
10
As
for
the
chieftain
who
is
among
them
he
should
come
in
when
they
come
in
and
he
should
go
out
when
they
go
out
11
During
the
festivals
and
the
festal
seasons
the
grain
offering
should
be
an
ephah
for
the
young
bull
an
ephah
for
the
ram
and
whatever
he
is
able
to
give
for
the
male
lambs
along
with
a
hin
of
oil
with
each
ephah
12
If
the
chieftain
provides
a
whole
burnt
offering
or
communion
sacrifices
as
a
voluntary
offering
to
Jehovah
the
gate
facing
east
will
be
opened
for
him
and
he
will
provide
his
whole
burnt
offering
and
his
communion
sacrifices
just
as
he
does
on
the
Sabbath
day
After
he
goes
out
the
gate
should
be
shut
behind
him
13
Each
day
you
should
provide
a
sound
male
lamb
in
its
first
year
as
a
whole
burnt
offering
to
Jehovah
You
should
do
this
morning
by
morning
14
Along
with
it
each
morning
you
should
provide
a
sixth
of
an
ephah
as
a
grain
offering
along
with
a
third
of
a
hin
of
oil
for
sprinkling
on
the
fine
flour
as
a
regular
grain
offering
to
Jehovah
This
is
a
lasting
statute
15
They
must
provide
the
male
lamb
the
grain
offering
and
the
oil
each
morning
as
a
regular
whole
burnt
offering
16
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
If
the
chieftain
gives
a
gift
to
each
one
of
his
sons
as
an
inheritance
it
will
become
the
property
of
his
sons
It
is
their
possession
by
inheritance
17
But
if
he
gives
a
gift
from
his
inheritance
to
one
of
his
servants
it
will
be
his
until
the
year
of
liberty
and
then
it
will
return
to
the
chieftain
Only
the
inheritance
of
his
sons
will
be
permanently
theirs
18
The
chieftain
should
not
take
any
of
the
inheritance
of
the
people
by
forcing
them
off
their
property
He
should
give
his
sons
an
inheritance
from
his
own
property
so
that
no
one
among
my
people
may
be
driven
from
his
property
19
Then
he
brought
me
in
by
the
entryway
that
was
beside
the
gate
leading
to
the
holy
dining
rooms
of
the
priests
which
faced
north
and
there
I
saw
a
place
at
the
rear
toward
the
west
20
He
said
to
me
This
is
the
place
where
the
priests
will
boil
the
guilt
offering
and
the
sin
offering
and
where
they
will
bake
the
grain
offering
so
that
they
will
not
carry
anything
out
to
the
outer
courtyard
and
transmit
holiness
to
the
people
21
He
brought
me
out
to
the
outer
courtyard
and
led
me
past
the
four
corners
of
the
courtyard
and
I
saw
a
courtyard
by
each
corner
of
the
outer
courtyard
22
At
the
four
corners
of
the
courtyard
were
small
courtyards
40
cubits
long
and
30
cubits
wide
All
four
of
them
were
the
same
size
23
There
were
ledges
all
around
the
four
of
them
and
beneath
the
ledges
were
built
places
to
boil
the
offerings
24
Then
he
said
to
me
These
are
the
houses
where
the
ministers
of
the
temple
boil
the
sacrifice
of
the
people
1
Then
he
brought
me
back
to
the
entrance
of
the
temple
and
there
I
saw
water
flowing
eastward
from
under
the
threshold
of
the
temple
for
the
front
of
the
temple
was
facing
east
The
water
was
flowing
down
from
under
the
right
side
of
the
temple
south
of
the
altar
2
He
then
led
me
out
by
way
of
the
north
gate
and
took
me
outside
and
around
to
the
outer
gate
that
is
facing
east
and
I
saw
water
trickling
from
the
right
side
3
When
the
man
went
out
toward
the
east
with
a
measuring
line
in
his
hand
he
measured
off
1000
cubits
and
had
me
pass
through
the
water
the
water
was
ankle
deep
4
Then
he
measured
off
another
1000
and
had
me
pass
through
the
water
and
it
was
up
to
the
knees
He
measured
off
another
1000
and
had
me
pass
through
and
the
water
was
up
to
the
hips
5
When
he
measured
off
another
1000
it
was
a
torrent
that
I
was
unable
to
walk
across
for
the
water
was
so
deep
that
one
had
to
swim
a
torrent
of
water
that
could
not
be
crossed
on
foot
6
He
asked
me
Have
you
seen
this
son
of
man
Then
he
had
me
walk
and
return
to
the
bank
of
the
stream
7
When
I
returned
I
saw
that
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
were
very
many
trees
on
both
sides
8
Then
he
said
to
me
This
water
flows
toward
the
eastern
region
and
continues
down
through
the
Arabah
and
enters
the
sea
When
it
enters
the
sea
the
water
there
will
be
healed
9
Swarms
of
living
creatures
will
be
able
to
live
wherever
the
waters
flow
There
will
be
an
abundance
of
fish
because
this
water
will
flow
there
The
seawater
will
be
healed
and
everything
will
live
wherever
the
stream
goes
10
Fishermen
will
stand
beside
it
from
En-gedi
clear
to
En-eglaim
where
there
will
be
a
drying
yard
for
dragnets
There
will
be
an
abundance
of
many
kinds
of
fish
like
the
fish
of
the
Great
Sea
11
It
will
have
swampy
places
and
marshy
places
and
these
will
not
be
healed
They
will
be
abandoned
to
salt
12
All
sorts
of
trees
for
food
will
grow
on
both
banks
of
the
stream
Their
leaves
will
not
wither
nor
will
their
fruitage
fail
Each
month
they
will
bear
new
fruit
because
the
water
for
them
flows
from
the
sanctuary
Their
fruitage
will
serve
as
food
and
their
leaves
for
healing
13
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
This
is
the
territory
that
you
will
assign
as
the
land
inheritance
of
the
12
tribes
of
Israel
and
Joseph
will
have
two
portions
14
You
will
inherit
it
and
receive
equal
shares
I
swore
to
give
this
land
to
your
forefathers
and
now
it
is
assigned
to
you
as
an
inheritance
15
This
is
the
boundary
of
the
land
on
the
northern
side
It
goes
from
the
Great
Sea
by
the
way
to
Hethlon
toward
Zedad
16
Hamath
Berothah
and
Sibraim
which
is
between
the
territory
of
Damascus
and
the
territory
of
Hamath
to
Hazer-hatticon
which
is
by
the
boundary
of
Hauran
17
So
the
boundary
will
run
from
the
sea
to
Hazar-enon
along
the
boundary
of
Damascus
to
the
north
and
the
boundary
of
Hamath
This
is
the
northern
border
18
The
eastern
side
runs
between
Hauran
and
Damascus
and
along
the
Jordan
between
Gilead
and
the
land
of
Israel
You
should
measure
from
the
boundary
to
the
eastern
sea
This
is
the
eastern
border
19
The
southern
border
will
be
from
Tamar
to
the
waters
of
Meribath-kadesh
then
to
the
Wadi
and
to
the
Great
Sea
This
is
the
southern
border
20
On
the
western
side
is
the
Great
Sea
from
the
boundary
up
to
a
point
opposite
Lebo-hamath
This
is
the
western
border
21
You
are
to
apportion
this
land
among
yourselves
among
the
12
tribes
of
Israel
22
You
should
distribute
it
for
inheritance
among
yourselves
and
to
the
foreigners
residing
with
you
who
have
had
children
while
living
among
you
and
they
will
be
like
native-born
Israelites
to
you
They
will
receive
an
inheritance
among
the
tribes
of
Israel
along
with
you
23
You
should
give
the
foreign
resident
an
inheritance
in
the
territory
of
the
tribe
where
he
has
taken
up
residence

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah

Zadok
those
who
took
care
of
their
responsibilities
toward
me
and
did
not
go
astray
when
the
Israelites
and
the
Levites
went
astray
12
They
will
have
a
portion
of
the
contribution
of
the
land
set
apart
as
something
most
holy
on
the
boundary
of
the
Levites
13
Right

14
They
should

sell
exchange

this
choicest
portion
of
the
land
for
it
is
something
holy
to
Jehovah
15
The
remaining
area
that
is
5000
cubits
wide
alongside
the

cubit
border
will
be
for
common
use
of
the
city
for

21
What

will
belong
to
the

to
the
tribes

In
the
third
year
of
the
kingship
of
King
Jehoiakim
of
Judah
King
Nebuchadnezzar
of
Babylon
came
to
Jerusalem
and
besieged
it
2
In
time
Jehovah
gave
King
Jehoiakim
of
Judah
into
his
hand
along
with
some
of
the
utensils
of
the
house
of
the
true
God
and
he
brought
them
to
the
land
of
Shinar
to
the
house
of
his
god
He
placed
the
utensils
in
the
treasury
of
his
god
3
Then
the
king
ordered
Ashpenaz
his
chief
court
official
to
bring
some
of
the
Israelites
including
those
of
royal
and
noble
descent
4
They
were
to
be
youths
without
any
defect
of
good
appearance
endowed
with
wisdom
knowledge
and
discernment
and
capable
of
serving
in
the
kings
palace
He
was
to
teach
them
the
writing
and
the
language
of
the
Chaldeans
5
Furthermore
the
king
assigned
to
them
a
daily
ration
from
the
kings
delicacies
and
from
the
wine
he
drank
They
were
to
be
trained
for
three
years
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
were
to
enter
the
kings
service
6
Now
among
them
were
some
from
the
tribe
of
Judah
Daniel
Hananiah
Mishael
and
Azariah
7
And
the
principal
court
official
assigned
names
to
them
he
gave
to
Daniel
the
name
Belteshazzar
to
Hananiah
the
name
Shadrach
to
Mishael
the
name
Meshach
and
to
Azariah
the
name
Abednego
8
But
Daniel
resolved
in
his
heart
that
he
would
not
defile
himself
with
the
kings
delicacies
or
with
the
wine
he
drank
So
he
asked
the
principal
court
official
for
permission
not
to
defile
himself
in
this
way
9
And
the
true
God
caused
the
principal
court
official
to
show
Daniel
favor
and
mercy
10
But
the
principal
court
official
said
to
Daniel
I
am
afraid
of
my
lord
the
king
who
has
assigned
your
food
and
drink
What
if
he
should
see
you
looking
worse
in
appearance
than
the
other
youths
of
your
age
You
would
make
me
guilty
before
the
king
11
But
Daniel
said
to
the
guardian
whom
the
principal
court
official
had
appointed
over
Daniel
Hananiah
Mishael
and
Azariah
12
Please
test
your
servants
for
ten
days
and
let
us
be
given
some
vegetables
to
eat
and
water
to
drink
13
then
compare
our
appearance
with
the
appearance
of
the
youths
who
are
eating
the
kings
delicacies
and
deal
with
your
servants
according
to
what
you
see
14
So
he
agreed
to
their
proposal
and
tested
them
for
ten
days
15
At
the
end
of
ten
days
their
appearance
was
better
and
healthier
than
all
the
youths
who
were
eating
the
kings
delicacies
16
So
the
guardian
would
take
away
their
delicacies
and
their
wine
and
give
them
vegetables
17
And
the
true
God
gave
these
four
youths
knowledge
and
insight
into
every
kind
of
writing
and
wisdom
and
Daniel
was
given
understanding
in
all
sorts
of
visions
and
dreams
18
At
the
end
of
the
time
that
the
king
had
specified
to
bring
them
in
the
principal
court
official
brought
them
in
before
Nebuchadnezzar
19
When
the
king
spoke
with
them
no
one
in
the
entire
group
was
found
to
be
like
Daniel
Hananiah
Mishael
and
Azariah
and
they
continued
to
serve
before
the
king
20
In
every
matter
requiring
wisdom
and
understanding
that
the
king
would
ask
them
about
he
found
them
ten
times
better
than
all
the
magic-practicing
priests
and
the
conjurers
in
his
entire
realm
21
And
Daniel
remained
there
until
the
first
year
of
King
Cyrus
1
In
the
second
year
of
his
kingship
Nebuchadnezzar
had
a
number
of
dreams
and
he
was
so
agitated
that
he
could
not
sleep
2
So
the
king
gave
the
order
to
summon
the
magic-practicing
priests
the
conjurers
the
sorcerers
and
the
Chaldeans
to
tell
the
king
his
dreams
So
they
came
in
and
stood
before
the
king
3
Then
the
king
said
to
them
I
have
had
a
dream
and
I
am
agitated
because
I
want
to
know
what
I
dreamed
4
The
Chaldeans
replied
to
the
king
in
the
Aramaic
language
O
king
may
you
live
on
forever
Relate
the
dream
to
your
servants
and
we
will
tell
the
interpretation
5
The
king
answered
the
Chaldeans
This
is
my
final
word
If
you
do
not
make
the
dream
known
to
me
along
with
its
interpretation
you
will
be
dismembered
and
your
houses
will
be
turned
into
public
latrines
6
But
if
you
do
tell
the
dream
and
its
interpretation
you
will
receive
from
me
gifts
and
a
reward
and
great
honor
So
tell
me
the
dream
and
its
interpretation
7
They
answered
a
second
time
Let
the
king
relate
the
dream
to
his
servants
and
we
will
tell
its
interpretation
8
The
king
replied
I
am
well-aware
that
you
are
trying
to
gain
time
for
you
realize
what
my
final
word
is
9
If
you
do
not
make
the
dream
known
to
me
there
is
only
one
penalty
for
all
of
you
But
you
have
agreed
to
tell
me
something
false
and
deceitful
until
the
situation
changes
So
tell
me
the
dream
and
I
will
know
that
you
can
explain
its
interpretation
10
The
Chaldeans
answered
the
king
There
is
not
a
man
on
earth
who
is
able
to
do
what
the
king
demands
for
no
great
king
or
governor
has
asked
such
a
thing
of
any
magic-practicing
priest
or
conjurer
or
Chaldean
11
What
the
king
is
asking
is
difficult
and
no
one
exists
who
could
tell
the
king
this
except
the
gods
who
do
not
dwell
among
mortals
12
At
this
the
king
flew
into
a
violent
rage
and
gave
the
order
to
destroy
all
the
wise
men
of
Babylon
13
When
the
order
was
issued
and
the
wise
men
were
about
to
be
killed
they
also
looked
for
Daniel
and
his
companions
to
put
them
to
death
14
At
that
time
Daniel
discreetly
and
cautiously
spoke
to
Arioch
the
chief
of
the
kings
bodyguard
who
had
gone
out
to
kill
the
wise
men
of
Babylon
15
He
asked
Arioch
the
officer
of
the
king
Why
is
there
such
a
harsh
order
from
the
king
Then
Arioch
informed
Daniel
about
the
matter
16
So
Daniel
went
in
and
asked
the
king
to
grant
him
time
to
tell
the
interpretation
to
the
king
17
Daniel
then
went
to
his
house
and
informed
his
companions
Hananiah
Mishael
and
Azariah
of
the
matter
18
He
asked
them
to
pray
for
mercy
from
the
God
of
heaven
concerning
this
secret
so
that
Daniel
and
his
companions
would
not
be
destroyed
along
with
the
rest
of
the
wise
men
of
Babylon
19
Then
the
secret
was
revealed
to
Daniel
in
a
vision
at
night
So
Daniel
praised
the
God
of
heaven
20
Daniel
declared
Let
the
name
of
God
be
praised
for
all
eternity
For
wisdom
and
mightiness
are
his
alone
21
He
changes
times
and
seasons
Removes
kings
and
sets
up
kings
Gives
wisdom
to
the
wise
and
knowledge
to
those
with
discernment
22
He
reveals
the
deep
things
and
the
hidden
things
He
knows
what
is
in
the
darkness
And
with
him
the
light
dwells
23
To
you
O
God
of
my
forefathers
I
offer
thanks
and
praise
Because
you
have
given
me
wisdom
and
power
And
now
you
have
made
known
to
me
what
we
requested
of
you
You
have
made
known
to
us
the
concern
of
the
king
24
Daniel
then
went
in
to
Arioch
whom
the
king
had
appointed
to
destroy
the
wise
men
of
Babylon
and
he
said
to
him
Do
not
destroy
any
wise
men
of
Babylon
Take
me
in
before
the
king
and
I
will
tell
the
interpretation
to
the
king
25
Arioch
quickly
took
Daniel
in
before
the
king
and
said
to
him
I
have
found
a
man
of
the
exiles
of
Judah
who
can
make
known
the
interpretation
to
the
king
26
The
king
said
to
Daniel
whose
name
was
Belteshazzar
Can
you
really
make
known
to
me
the
dream
that
I
saw
and
its
interpretation
27
Daniel
replied
to
the
king
None
of
the
wise
men
conjurers
magic-practicing
priests
or
astrologers
are
able
to
tell
the
king
the
secret
that
he
is
asking
28
But
there
is
a
God
in
the
heavens
who
is
a
Revealer
of
secrets
and
he
has
made
known
to
King
Nebuchadnezzar
what
is
to
happen
in
the
final
part
of
the
days
This
is
your
dream
and
these
are
the
visions
of
your
head
as
you
lay
on
your
bed
29
As
for
you
O
king
on
your
bed
your
thoughts
turned
to
what
is
to
take
place
in
the
future
and
the
Revealer
of
secrets
has
made
known
to
you
what
is
to
happen
30
As
for
me
this
secret
was
not
revealed
to
me
because
I
have
greater
wisdom
than
anyone
living
rather
it
was
to
make
the
interpretation
known
to
the
king
so
that
you
may
know
the
thoughts
in
your
heart
31
You
O
king
were
watching
and
you
saw
an
immense
image
That
image
which
was
huge
and
extremely
bright
was
standing
in
front
of
you
and
its
appearance
was
terrifying
32
The
head
of
that
image
was
of
fine
gold
its
chest
and
its
arms
were
of
silver
its
abdomen
and
its
thighs
were
of
copper
33
its
legs
were
of
iron
and
its
feet
were
partly
of
iron
and
partly
of
clay
34
You
looked
on
until
a
stone
was
cut
out
not
by
hands
and
it
struck
the
image
on
its
feet
of
iron
and
of
clay
and
crushed
them
35
At
that
time
the
iron
the
clay
the
copper
the
silver
and
the
gold
were
all
together
crushed
and
became
like
the
chaff
from
the
summer
threshing
floor
and
the
wind
carried
them
away
so
that
not
a
trace
of
them
could
be
found
But
the
stone
that
struck
the
image
became
a
large
mountain
and
it
filled
the
whole
earth
36
This
is
the
dream
and
we
will
now
tell
the
king
its
interpretation
37
You
O
king—the
king
of
kings
to
whom
the
God
of
heaven
has
given
the
kingdom
the
might
the
strength
and
the
glory
38
and
into
whose
hand
he
has
given
men
wherever
they
may
dwell
as
well
as
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
whom
he
has
made
ruler
over
all
of
them—you
yourself
are
the
head
of
gold
39
But
after
you
another
kingdom
will
rise
inferior
to
you
then
another
kingdom
a
third
one
of
copper
that
will
rule
over
the
whole
earth
40
As
for
the
fourth
kingdom
it
will
be
strong
like
iron
For
just
as
iron
crushes
and
pulverizes
everything
else
yes
like
iron
that
shatters
it
will
crush
and
shatter
all
of
these
41
And
just
as
you
saw
the
feet
and
the
toes
to
be
partly
of
clay
of
a
potter
and
partly
of
iron
the
kingdom
will
be
divided
but
some
of
the
hardness
of
iron
will
be
in
it
just
as
you
saw
the
iron
mixed
with
soft
clay
42
And
as
the
toes
of
the
feet
were
partly
of
iron
and
partly
of
clay
so
the
kingdom
will
be
partly
strong
and
partly
fragile
43
Just
as
you
saw
iron
mixed
with
soft
clay
they
will
be
mixed
with
the
people
but
they
will
not
stick
together
one
to
the
other
just
as
iron
does
not
mix
with
clay
44
In
the
days
of
those
kings
the
God
of
heaven
will
set
up
a
kingdom
that
will
never
be
destroyed
And
this
kingdom
will
not
be
passed
on
to
any
other
people
It
will
crush
and
put
an
end
to
all
these
kingdoms
and
it
alone
will
stand
forever
45
just
as
you
saw
that
out
of
the
mountain
a
stone
was
cut
not
by
hands
and
that
it
crushed
the
iron
the
copper
the
clay
the
silver
and
the
gold
The
Grand
God
has
made
known
to
the
king
what
will
happen
in
the
future
The
dream
is
true
and
its
interpretation
is
trustworthy
46
Then
King
Nebuchadnezzar
fell
down
with
his
face
to
the
ground
before
Daniel
and
paid
homage
to
him
And
he
gave
the
order
to
offer
a
present
and
incense
to
him
47
The
king
said
to
Daniel
Truly
your
God
is
a
God
of
gods
and
a
Lord
of
kings
and
a
Revealer
of
secrets
because
you
were
able
to
reveal
this
secret
48
The
king
then
elevated
Daniel
and
gave
him
many
fine
gifts
and
he
made
him
the
ruler
over
all
the
province
of
Babylon
and
the
chief
prefect
over
all
the
wise
men
of
Babylon
49
And
at
Daniels
request
the
king
appointed
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
over
the
administration
of
the
province
of
Babylon
but
Daniel
served
in
the
kings
court
1
Nebuchadnezzar
the
king
made
an
image
of
gold
that
was
60
cubits
high
and
6
cubits
wide
He
set
it
up
on
the
plain
of
Dura
in
the
province
of
Babylon
2
Then
King
Nebuchadnezzar
sent
word
to
assemble
the
satraps
prefects
governors
advisers
treasurers
judges
magistrates
and
all
the
administrators
of
the
provinces
to
come
to
the
inauguration
of
the
image
that
King
Nebuchadnezzar
had
set
up
3
So
the
satraps
prefects
governors
advisers
treasurers
judges
magistrates
and
all
the
administrators
of
the
provinces
assembled
for
the
inauguration
of
the
image
that
King
Nebuchadnezzar
had
set
up
And
they
stood
in
front
of
the
image
that
Nebuchadnezzar
had
set
up
4
The
herald
loudly
proclaimed
You
are
commanded
O
peoples
nations
and
language
groups
5
that
when
you
hear
the
sound
of
the
horn
pipe
zither
triangular
harp
stringed
instrument
bagpipe
and
all
the
other
musical
instruments
you
must
fall
down
and
worship
the
image
of
gold
that
King
Nebuchadnezzar
has
set
up
6
Whoever
does
not
fall
down
and
worship
will
immediately
be
thrown
into
the
burning
fiery
furnace
7
So
when
all
the
peoples
heard
the
sound
of
the
horn
pipe
zither
triangular
harp
stringed
instrument
and
all
the
other
musical
instruments
all
the
peoples
nations
and
language
groups
fell
down
and
worshipped
the
image
of
gold
that
King
Nebuchadnezzar
had
set
up
8
Now
at
that
time
some
of
the
Chaldeans
came
forward
and
accused
the
Jews
9
They
said
to
King
Nebuchadnezzar
O
king
may
you
live
on
forever
10
You
O
king
gave
the
command
that
every
man
who
hears
the
sound
of
the
horn
pipe
zither
triangular
harp
stringed
instrument
bagpipe
and
all
the
other
musical
instruments
should
fall
down
and
worship
the
image
of
gold
11
and
that
whoever
would
not
fall
down
and
worship
should
be
thrown
into
the
burning
fiery
furnace
12
But
there
are
certain
Jews
whom
you
appointed
to
administer
the
province
of
Babylon
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
These
men
have
paid
no
regard
to
you
O
king
They
are
not
serving
your
gods
and
they
refuse
to
worship
the
image
of
gold
that
you
have
set
up
13
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
in
a
furious
rage
ordered
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
to
be
brought
in
So
these
men
were
brought
in
before
the
king
14
Nebuchadnezzar
said
to
them
Is
it
really
true
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
that
you
are
not
serving
my
gods
and
that
you
refuse
to
worship
the
image
of
gold
that
I
have
set
up
15
Now
when
you
hear
the
sound
of
the
horn
the
pipe
the
zither
the
triangular
harp
the
stringed
instrument
the
bagpipe
and
all
the
other
musical
instruments
if
you
are
ready
to
fall
down
and
worship
the
image
that
I
have
made
fine
But
if
you
refuse
to
worship
you
will
immediately
be
thrown
into
the
burning
fiery
furnace
And
who
is
the
god
who
can
rescue
you
out
of
my
hands
16
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
answered
the
king
O
Nebuchadnezzar
we
have
no
need
to
answer
you
in
this
matter
17
If
it
must
be
our
God
whom
we
serve
is
able
to
rescue
us
from
the
burning
fiery
furnace
O
king
and
to
rescue
us
from
your
hand
18
But
even
if
he
does
not
let
it
be
known
to
you
O
king
that
we
will
not
serve
your
gods
or
worship
the
image
of
gold
that
you
have
set
up
19
Then
Nebuchadnezzar
became
so
furious
with
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
that
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
toward
them
and
he
gave
orders
to
heat
the
furnace
seven
times
hotter
than
usual
20
He
ordered
some
of
the
mighty
men
from
his
army
to
bind
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
and
to
throw
them
into
the
burning
fiery
furnace
21
So
these
men
were
tied
up
while
still
wearing
their
cloaks
garments
caps
and
all
their
other
clothing
and
they
were
thrown
into
the
burning
fiery
furnace
22
Because
the
kings
command
was
so
harsh
and
the
furnace
was
exceptionally
hot
the
men
who
took
up
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
were
the
ones
killed
by
the
flames
of
the
fire
23
But
these
three
men
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
fell
bound
into
the
burning
fiery
furnace
24
King
Nebuchadnezzar
then
became
frightened
and
quickly
rose
up
and
said
to
his
high
officials
Did
we
not
tie
up
three
men
and
throw
them
into
the
fire
They
answered
the
king
Yes
O
king
25
He
said
Look
I
see
four
men
walking
about
free
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
they
are
unharmed
and
the
fourth
one
looks
like
a
son
of
the
gods
26
Nebuchadnezzar
approached
the
door
of
the
burning
fiery
furnace
and
said
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
you
servants
of
the
Most
High
God
step
out
and
come
here
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
stepped
out
from
the
midst
of
the
fire
27
And
the
satraps
prefects
governors
and
the
high
officials
of
the
king
who
were
assembled
there
saw
that
the
fire
had
had
no
effect
on
the
bodies
of
these
men
not
a
hair
of
their
heads
had
been
singed
their
cloaks
looked
no
different
and
there
was
not
even
the
smell
of
fire
on
them
28
Nebuchadnezzar
then
declared
Praised
be
the
God
of
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
who
sent
his
angel
and
rescued
his
servants
They
trusted
in
him
and
went
against
the
command
of
the
king
and
were
willing
to
die
rather
than
serve
or
worship
any
god
except
their
own
God
29
I
am
therefore
issuing
an
order
that
any
people
nation
or
language
group
that
says
anything
against
the
God
of
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
should
be
dismembered
and
their
houses
should
be
turned
into
public
latrines
for
there
is
no
other
god
who
is
able
to
rescue
like
this
one
30
The
king
then
promoted
Shadrach
Meshach
and
Abednego
in
the
province
of
Babylon
1
From
King
Nebuchadnezzar
to
all
the
peoples
nations
and
language
groups
dwelling
in
all
the
earth
May
your
peace
abound
2
I
am
pleased
to
declare
the
signs
and
wonders
that
the
Most
High
God
has
performed
toward
me
3
How
great
are
his
signs
and
how
mighty
his
wonders
His
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom
and
his
rulership
is
for
generation
after
generation
4
I
Nebuchadnezzar
was
at
ease
in
my
house
and
prospering
in
my
palace
5
I
saw
a
dream
that
made
me
afraid
As
I
lay
on
my
bed
the
images
and
visions
of
my
head
frightened
me
6
So
I
issued
an
order
to
bring
in
before
me
all
the
wise
men
of
Babylon
so
that
they
could
make
known
to
me
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
7
At
that
time
the
magic-practicing
priests
the
conjurers
the
Chaldeans
and
the
astrologers
came
in
When
I
told
them
what
the
dream
was
they
could
not
make
its
interpretation
known
to
me
8
At
last
there
came
in
before
me
Daniel
whose
name
is
Belteshazzar
after
the
name
of
my
god
and
in
whom
there
is
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
and
I
told
him
the
dream
9
O
Belteshazzar
the
chief
of
the
magic-practicing
priests
I
well
know
that
the
spirit
of
the
holy
gods
is
in
you
and
no
secret
is
too
difficult
for
you
So
explain
to
me
the
visions
I
saw
in
my
dream
and
its
interpretation
10
In
the
visions
of
my
head
while
on
my
bed
I
saw
a
tree
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
and
its
height
was
enormous
11
The
tree
grew
and
became
strong
and
its
top
reached
the
heavens
and
it
was
visible
to
the
ends
of
the
whole
earth
12
Its
foliage
was
beautiful
and
its
fruit
was
abundant
and
there
was
food
on
it
for
all
Beneath
it
the
beasts
of
the
field
would
seek
shade
and
on
its
branches
the
birds
of
the
heavens
would
dwell
and
all
creatures
would
feed
from
it
13
As
I
viewed
the
visions
of
my
head
while
on
my
bed
I
saw
a
watcher
a
holy
one
coming
down
from
the
heavens
14
He
called
out
loudly
Chop
down
the
tree
cut
off
its
branches
shake
off
its
leaves
and
scatter
its
fruit
Let
the
beasts
flee
from
beneath
it
and
the
birds
from
its
branches
15
But
leave
the
stump
with
its
roots
in
the
ground
with
a
banding
of
iron
and
of
copper
among
the
grass
of
the
field
Let
it
be
wet
with
the
dew
of
the
heavens
and
let
its
portion
be
with
the
beasts
among
the
vegetation
of
the
earth
16
Let
its
heart
be
changed
from
that
of
a
human
and
let
it
be
given
the
heart
of
a
beast
and
let
seven
times
pass
over
it
17
This
is
by
the
decree
of
watchers
and
the
request
is
by
the
word
of
the
holy
ones
so
that
people
living
may
know
that
the
Most
High
is
Ruler
in
the
kingdom
of
mankind
and
that
he
gives
it
to
whomever
he
wants
and
he
sets
up
over
it
even
the
lowliest
of
men
18
This
was
the
dream
that
I
King
Nebuchadnezzar
saw
now
you
O
Belteshazzar
tell
its
interpretation
for
all
the
other
wise
men
of
my
kingdom
are
unable
to
make
the
interpretation
known
to
me
But
you
are
able
to
do
so
because
the
spirit
of
holy
gods
is
in
you
19
At
that
time
Daniel
whose
name
is
Belteshazzar
was
alarmed
for
a
moment
and
his
thoughts
began
to
frighten
him
The
king
said
O
Belteshazzar
do
not
let
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
frighten
you
Belteshazzar
answered
O
my
lord
may
the
dream
apply
to
those
hating
you
and
its
interpretation
to
your
enemies
20
The
tree
that
you
saw
that
grew
great
and
became
strong
whose
top
reached
the
heavens
and
was
visible
to
all
the
earth
21
which
had
beautiful
foliage
abundant
fruit
and
food
for
all
beneath
which
the
beasts
of
the
field
would
dwell
and
on
whose
branches
the
birds
of
the
heavens
would
reside
22
it
is
you
O
king
because
you
have
grown
great
and
become
strong
and
your
grandeur
has
grown
and
reached
to
the
heavens
and
your
rulership
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
23
And
the
king
saw
a
watcher
a
holy
one
coming
down
from
the
heavens
who
was
saying
Chop
down
the
tree
and
destroy
it
but
leave
the
stump
with
its
roots
in
the
ground
with
a
banding
of
iron
and
of
copper
among
the
grass
of
the
field
And
let
the
dew
of
the
heavens
make
it
wet
and
let
its
portion
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
until
seven
times
pass
over
it
24
This
is
the
interpretation
O
king
it
is
the
decree
of
the
Most
High
that
must
befall
my
lord
the
king
25
You
will
be
driven
away
from
among
men
and
your
dwelling
will
be
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
you
will
be
given
vegetation
to
eat
just
like
bulls
and
you
will
become
wet
with
the
dew
of
the
heavens
and
seven
times
will
pass
over
you
until
you
know
that
the
Most
High
is
Ruler
in
the
kingdom
of
mankind
and
that
he
grants
it
to
whomever
he
wants
26
But
because
they
said
to
leave
the
stump
of
the
tree
with
its
roots
your
kingdom
will
be
yours
again
after
you
come
to
know
that
the
heavens
are
ruling
27
Therefore
O
king
may
my
counsel
be
acceptable
to
you
Turn
away
from
your
sins
by
doing
what
is
right
and
from
your
iniquity
by
showing
mercy
to
the
poor
It
may
be
that
your
prosperity
will
be
extended
28
All
of
this
befell
King
Nebuchadnezzar
29
Twelve
months
later
he
was
walking
on
the
roof
of
the
royal
palace
of
Babylon
30
The
king
was
saying
Is
this
not
Babylon
the
Great
that
I
myself
have
built
for
the
royal
house
by
my
own
strength
and
might
and
for
the
glory
of
my
majesty
31
While
the
word
was
yet
in
the
kings
mouth
a
voice
came
down
from
the
heavens
To
you
it
is
being
said
O
King
Nebuchadnezzar
The
kingdom
has
gone
away
from
you
32
and
from
mankind
you
are
being
driven
away
With
the
beasts
of
the
field
your
dwelling
will
be
and
you
will
be
given
vegetation
to
eat
just
like
bulls
and
seven
times
will
pass
over
you
until
you
know
that
the
Most
High
is
Ruler
in
the
kingdom
of
mankind
and
that
he
grants
it
to
whomever
he
wants
33
At
that
moment
the
word
was
fulfilled
on
Nebuchadnezzar
He
was
driven
away
from
mankind
and
he
began
to
eat
vegetation
just
like
bulls
and
his
body
became
wet
with
the
dew
of
the
heavens
until
his
hair
grew
long
just
like
eagles
feathers
and
his
nails
were
like
birds
claws
34
At
the
end
of
that
time
I
Nebuchadnezzar
looked
up
to
the
heavens
and
my
understanding
returned
to
me
and
I
praised
the
Most
High
and
to
the
One
living
forever
I
gave
praise
and
glory
because
his
rulership
is
an
everlasting
rulership
and
his
kingdom
is
for
generation
after
generation
35
All
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
regarded
as
nothing
and
he
does
according
to
his
own
will
among
the
army
of
the
heavens
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
And
there
is
no
one
who
can
hinder
him
or
say
to
him
What
have
you
done
36
At
that
time
my
understanding
returned
to
me
and
the
glory
of
my
kingdom
my
majesty
and
my
splendor
returned
to
me
My
high
officials
and
nobles
eagerly
sought
me
out
and
I
was
restored
to
my
kingdom
and
even
more
greatness
was
added
to
me
37
Now
I
Nebuchadnezzar
am
praising
and
exalting
and
glorifying
the
King
of
the
heavens
because
all
his
works
are
truth
and
his
ways
are
just
and
because
he
is
able
to
humiliate
those
who
are
walking
in
pride
1
As
regards
King
Belshazzar
he
held
a
great
feast
for
a
thousand
of
his
nobles
and
he
was
drinking
wine
in
front
of
them
2
While
under
the
influence
of
the
wine
Belshazzar
gave
an
order
to
bring
in
the
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
that
his
father
Nebuchadnezzar
had
taken
from
the
temple
in
Jerusalem
so
that
the
king
and
his
nobles
his
concubines
and
his
secondary
wives
could
drink
from
them
3
Then
they
brought
in
the
gold
vessels
that
had
been
taken
from
the
temple
of
the
house
of
God
in
Jerusalem
and
the
king
and
his
nobles
his
concubines
and
his
secondary
wives
drank
from
them
4
They
drank
wine
and
they
praised
the
gods
of
gold
and
silver
of
copper
iron
wood
and
stone
5
At
that
very
moment
the
fingers
of
a
mans
hand
appeared
and
began
writing
on
the
plaster
of
the
wall
of
the
kings
palace
opposite
the
lampstand
and
the
king
could
see
the
back
of
the
hand
as
it
was
writing
6
Then
the
king
turned
pale
and
his
thoughts
terrified
him
and
his
hips
shook
and
his
knees
began
to
knock
together
7
The
king
called
out
loudly
to
summon
the
conjurers
the
Chaldeans
and
the
astrologers
The
king
said
to
the
wise
men
of
Babylon
Any
man
who
reads
this
writing
and
tells
me
its
interpretation
will
be
clothed
with
purple
a
gold
necklace
will
be
placed
around
his
neck
and
he
will
rule
as
the
third
one
in
the
kingdom
8
Then
all
the
wise
men
of
the
king
came
in
but
they
were
not
able
to
read
the
writing
or
to
make
known
the
interpretation
to
the
king
9
So
King
Belshazzar
was
very
frightened
and
his
face
turned
pale
and
his
nobles
were
perplexed
10
Because
of
the
words
of
the
king
and
his
nobles
the
queen
entered
the
banqueting
hall
The
queen
said
O
king
may
you
live
on
forever
Do
not
let
your
thoughts
terrify
you
nor
let
your
face
turn
pale
11
There
is
a
man
in
your
kingdom
who
has
the
spirit
of
holy
gods
In
the
days
of
your
father
enlightenment
and
insight
and
wisdom
like
the
wisdom
of
gods
were
found
in
him
King
Nebuchadnezzar
your
father
appointed
him
as
chief
of
the
magic-practicing
priests
conjurers
Chaldeans
and
astrologers
your
father
did
this
O
king
12
For
Daniel
whom
the
king
named
Belteshazzar
had
an
extraordinary
spirit
and
knowledge
and
insight
to
interpret
dreams
to
explain
riddles
and
to
solve
knotty
problems
Now
let
Daniel
be
summoned
and
he
will
tell
you
the
interpretation
13
So
Daniel
was
brought
in
before
the
king
The
king
asked
Daniel
Are
you
Daniel
of
the
exiles
of
Judah
whom
my
father
the
king
brought
out
of
Judah
14
I
have
heard
concerning
you
that
the
spirit
of
gods
is
in
you
and
that
enlightenment
and
insight
and
extraordinary
wisdom
have
been
found
in
you
15
Now
the
wise
men
and
the
conjurers
were
brought
in
before
me
to
read
this
writing
and
to
make
its
interpretation
known
to
me
but
they
are
not
able
to
tell
the
interpretation
of
the
message
16
But
I
have
heard
concerning
you
that
you
are
able
to
provide
interpretations
and
to
solve
knotty
problems
Now
if
you
are
able
to
read
the
writing
and
to
make
its
interpretation
known
to
me
you
will
be
clothed
with
purple
a
gold
necklace
will
be
placed
around
your
neck
and
you
will
rule
as
the
third
one
in
the
kingdom
17
Daniel
then
replied
to
the
king
You
may
keep
your
gifts
and
give
your
presents
to
others
However
I
will
read
the
writing
to
the
king
and
make
known
its
interpretation
to
him
18
As
for
you
O
king
the
Most
High
God
granted
to
Nebuchadnezzar
your
father
the
kingdom
and
greatness
and
honor
and
majesty
19
Because
of
the
greatness
He
gave
him
all
peoples
nations
and
language
groups
trembled
with
fear
before
him
Whomever
he
wanted
he
killed
or
let
live
and
whomever
he
wanted
he
exalted
or
humiliated
20
But
when
his
heart
became
haughty
and
his
spirit
became
hardened
so
that
he
acted
presumptuously
he
was
brought
down
from
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
and
his
dignity
was
taken
away
from
him
21
He
was
driven
away
from
mankind
and
his
heart
was
made
like
that
of
a
beast
and
his
dwelling
was
with
the
wild
donkeys
He
was
given
vegetation
to
eat
just
like
bulls
and
his
body
became
wet
with
the
dew
of
the
heavens
until
he
came
to
know
that
the
Most
High
God
is
Ruler
in
the
kingdom
of
mankind
and
that
he
sets
up
over
it
whomever
he
wants
22
But
you
his
son
Belshazzar
have
not
humbled
your
heart
although
you
knew
all
of
this
23
Instead
you
exalted
yourself
against
the
Lord
of
the
heavens
and
you
had
them
bring
you
the
vessels
of
his
house
Then
you
and
your
nobles
your
concubines
and
your
secondary
wives
drank
wine
from
them
and
praised
gods
of
silver
and
gold
of
copper
iron
wood
and
stone
gods
that
see
nothing
and
hear
nothing
and
know
nothing
But
you
have
not
glorified
the
God
in
whose
hand
is
your
breath
and
all
your
ways
24
So
the
hand
was
sent
from
him
and
this
writing
was
inscribed
25
And
this
is
the
writing
that
was
inscribed
MENE
MENE
TEKEL
and
PARSIN
26
This
is
the
interpretation
of
the
words
MENE
God
has
numbered
the
days
of
your
kingdom
and
brought
it
to
an
end
27
TEKEL
you
have
been
weighed
in
the
balances
and
found
lacking
28
PERES
your
kingdom
has
been
divided
and
given
to
the
Medes
and
the
Persians
29
Then
Belshazzar
gave
the
command
and
they
clothed
Daniel
with
purple
and
placed
a
gold
necklace
around
his
neck
and
they
heralded
concerning
him
that
he
was
to
become
the
third
ruler
in
the
kingdom
30
That
very
night
Belshazzar
the
Chaldean
king
was
killed
31
And
Darius
the
Mede
received
the
kingdom
he
was
about
62
years
old
1
It
seemed
good
to
Darius
to
appoint
120
satraps
over
the
whole
kingdom
2
Over
them
were
three
high
officials
one
of
whom
was
Daniel
and
the
satraps
would
report
to
them
so
that
the
king
would
not
suffer
loss
3
Now
Daniel
was
distinguishing
himself
over
the
other
high
officials
and
the
satraps
for
there
was
an
extraordinary
spirit
in
him
and
the
king
intended
to
elevate
him
over
the
entire
kingdom
4
At
that
time
the
high
officials
and
the
satraps
were
seeking
to
find
some
grounds
for
accusation
against
Daniel
respecting
matters
of
state
but
they
could
find
no
grounds
for
accusation
or
anything
corrupt
for
he
was
trustworthy
and
no
negligence
or
corruption
could
be
found
in
him
5
These
men
then
said
We
will
find
in
this
Daniel
no
grounds
for
accusation
at
all
unless
we
find
it
against
him
in
the
law
of
his
God
6
So
these
high
officials
and
satraps
went
in
as
a
group
to
the
king
and
they
said
to
him
O
King
Darius
may
you
live
on
forever
7
All
the
royal
officials
prefects
satraps
high
royal
officers
and
governors
have
consulted
together
to
establish
a
royal
decree
and
to
enforce
a
ban
that
for
30
days
whoever
makes
a
petition
to
any
god
or
man
except
to
you
O
king
should
be
thrown
into
the
lions
pit
8
Now
O
king
may
you
establish
the
decree
and
sign
it
so
that
it
cannot
be
changed
according
to
the
law
of
the
Medes
and
the
Persians
which
cannot
be
annulled
9
So
King
Darius
signed
the
decree
and
the
ban
10
But
as
soon
as
Daniel
knew
that
the
decree
had
been
signed
he
went
to
his
house
which
had
the
windows
of
his
roof
chamber
open
toward
Jerusalem
And
three
times
a
day
he
got
down
on
his
knees
and
prayed
and
offered
praise
before
his
God
as
he
had
regularly
done
prior
to
this
11
At
that
time
those
men
burst
in
and
found
Daniel
petitioning
and
pleading
for
favor
before
his
God
12
So
they
approached
the
king
and
reminded
him
about
the
royal
ban
Did
you
not
sign
a
ban
stating
that
for
30
days
any
man
who
makes
a
petition
to
any
god
or
man
except
to
you
O
king
should
be
thrown
into
the
lions
pit
The
king
replied
The
matter
is
well-established
according
to
the
law
of
the
Medes
and
the
Persians
which
cannot
be
annulled
13
They
immediately
said
to
the
king
Daniel
who
is
of
the
exiles
of
Judah
has
paid
no
regard
to
you
O
king
nor
to
the
ban
that
you
signed
but
three
times
a
day
he
is
praying
14
As
soon
as
the
king
heard
this
he
was
greatly
distressed
and
he
tried
to
think
of
a
way
to
rescue
Daniel
and
until
the
sun
set
he
made
every
effort
to
save
him
15
Finally
those
men
went
in
as
a
group
to
the
king
and
they
said
to
the
king
Take
note
O
king
that
the
law
of
the
Medes
and
the
Persians
is
that
any
ban
or
decree
that
the
king
establishes
cannot
be
changed
16
So
the
king
gave
the
order
and
they
brought
Daniel
and
threw
him
into
the
pit
of
lions
The
king
said
to
Daniel
Your
God
whom
you
are
continually
serving
will
rescue
you
17
Then
a
stone
was
brought
and
placed
over
the
entrance
of
the
pit
and
the
king
sealed
it
with
his
signet
ring
and
with
the
signet
ring
of
his
nobles
so
that
nothing
could
be
changed
with
regard
to
Daniel
18
The
king
then
went
to
his
palace
He
passed
the
night
fasting
and
refused
any
entertainment
and
he
could
not
sleep
19
Finally
at
the
first
light
of
dawn
the
king
got
up
and
hurried
to
the
lions
pit
20
As
he
got
near
the
pit
he
called
out
to
Daniel
with
a
sad
voice
The
king
asked
Daniel
O
Daniel
servant
of
the
living
God
has
your
God
whom
you
are
continually
serving
been
able
to
rescue
you
from
the
lions
21
Daniel
immediately
said
to
the
king
O
king
may
you
live
on
forever
22
My
God
sent
his
angel
and
shut
the
mouth
of
the
lions
and
they
have
not
harmed
me
for
I
was
found
innocent
before
him
nor
have
I
done
any
wrong
to
you
O
king
23
The
king
was
overjoyed
and
he
commanded
that
Daniel
be
lifted
up
out
of
the
pit
When
Daniel
was
lifted
up
out
of
the
pit
he
was
completely
unharmed
because
he
had
trusted
in
his
God
24
The
king
then
gave
an
order
and
the
men
who
had
accused
Daniel
were
brought
and
they
were
thrown
into
the
lions
pit
along
with
their
sons
and
their
wives
They
had
not
reached
the
bottom
of
the
pit
before
the
lions
overpowered
them
and
crushed
all
their
bones
25
Then
King
Darius
wrote
to
all
the
peoples
nations
and
language
groups
dwelling
throughout
the
earth
May
you
have
abundant
peace
26
I
am
issuing
an
order
that
in
every
domain
of
my
kingdom
people
are
to
tremble
in
fear
before
the
God
of
Daniel
For
he
is
the
living
God
and
he
endures
forever
His
kingdom
will
never
be
destroyed
and
his
rulership
is
eternal
27
He
rescues
saves
and
performs
signs
and
wonders
in
the
heavens
and
on
the
earth
for
he
rescued
Daniel
from
the
paw
of
the
lions
28
So
this
Daniel
prospered
in
the
kingdom
of
Darius
and
in
the
kingdom
of
Cyrus
the
Persian
1
In
the
first
year
of
King
Belshazzar
of
Babylon
Daniel
saw
a
dream
and
visions
of
his
head
as
he
lay
on
his
bed
Then
he
wrote
down
the
dream
he
recorded
a
complete
account
of
the
matters
2
Daniel
declared
I
was
watching
in
my
visions
during
the
night
and
look
the
four
winds
of
the
heavens
were
stirring
up
the
vast
sea
3
And
four
huge
beasts
came
out
of
the
sea
each
different
from
the
others
4
The
first
one
was
like
a
lion
and
it
had
the
wings
of
an
eagle
I
watched
until
its
wings
were
plucked
out
and
it
was
lifted
up
from
the
earth
and
was
made
to
stand
up
on
two
feet
like
a
man
and
it
was
given
the
heart
of
a
man
5
And
look
another
beast
a
second
one
like
a
bear
It
was
raised
up
on
one
side
and
three
ribs
were
in
its
mouth
between
its
teeth
and
it
was
told
Get
up
eat
much
flesh
6
After
this
I
kept
watching
and
look
another
beast
like
a
leopard
but
on
its
back
it
had
four
wings
like
those
of
a
bird
And
the
beast
had
four
heads
and
it
was
given
authority
to
rule
7
After
this
I
kept
watching
in
the
visions
of
the
night
and
I
saw
a
fourth
beast
fearsome
and
terrifying
and
unusually
strong
and
it
had
large
iron
teeth
It
was
devouring
and
crushing
and
what
was
left
it
trampled
down
with
its
feet
It
was
different
from
all
the
other
beasts
that
were
prior
to
it
and
it
had
ten
horns
8
While
I
considered
the
horns
look
another
horn
a
small
one
came
up
among
them
and
three
of
the
first
horns
were
plucked
up
from
before
it
And
look
there
were
eyes
like
human
eyes
in
this
horn
and
there
was
a
mouth
speaking
arrogantly
9
I
kept
watching
until
thrones
were
set
in
place
and
the
Ancient
of
Days
sat
down
His
clothing
was
white
like
snow
and
the
hair
of
his
head
was
like
clean
wool
His
throne
was
flames
of
fire
its
wheels
were
a
burning
fire
10
A
stream
of
fire
was
flowing
and
going
out
from
before
him
A
thousand
thousands
kept
ministering
to
him
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
stood
before
him
The
Court
took
its
seat
and
books
were
opened
11
I
kept
watching
at
that
time
because
of
the
sound
of
the
arrogant
words
that
the
horn
was
speaking
I
watched
until
the
beast
was
killed
and
its
body
was
destroyed
and
it
was
given
over
to
be
burned
in
the
fire
12
But
as
for
the
rest
of
the
beasts
their
rulerships
were
taken
away
and
their
lives
were
prolonged
for
a
time
and
a
season
13
I
kept
watching
in
the
visions
of
the
night
and
look
with
the
clouds
of
the
heavens
someone
like
a
son
of
man
was
coming
and
he
gained
access
to
the
Ancient
of
Days
and
they
brought
him
up
close
before
that
One
14
And
to
him
there
were
given
rulership
honor
and
a
kingdom
that
the
peoples
nations
and
language
groups
should
all
serve
him
His
rulership
is
an
everlasting
rulership
that
will
not
pass
away
and
his
kingdom
will
not
be
destroyed
15
As
for
me
Daniel
my
spirit
was
distressed
within
me
because
the
visions
of
my
head
frightened
me
16
I
went
near
to
one
of
those
who
were
standing
there
to
ask
him
about
the
true
meaning
of
this
So
he
replied
and
made
known
to
me
the
interpretation
of
these
things
17
These
huge
beasts
four
in
number
are
four
kings
who
will
stand
up
from
the
earth
18
But
the
holy
ones
of
the
Supreme
One
will
receive
the
kingdom
and
they
will
possess
the
kingdom
forever
yes
forever
and
ever
19
Then
I
wanted
to
know
more
about
the
fourth
beast
which
was
different
from
all
the
others
it
was
extraordinarily
fearsome
with
iron
teeth
and
copper
claws
and
it
was
devouring
and
crushing
and
trampling
down
what
was
left
with
its
feet
20
and
about
the
ten
horns
on
its
head
and
the
other
horn
that
came
up
and
before
which
three
fell
the
horn
that
had
eyes
and
a
mouth
speaking
arrogantly
and
whose
appearance
was
bigger
than
that
of
the
others
21
I
kept
watching
as
that
horn
made
war
on
the
holy
ones
and
it
was
prevailing
against
them
22
until
the
Ancient
of
Days
came
and
judgment
was
rendered
in
favor
of
the
holy
ones
of
the
Supreme
One
and
the
appointed
time
arrived
for
the
holy
ones
to
take
possession
of
the
kingdom
23
This
is
what
he
said
As
for
the
fourth
beast
there
is
a
fourth
kingdom
that
will
come
to
be
on
the
earth
It
will
be
different
from
all
the
other
kingdoms
and
it
will
devour
all
the
earth
and
will
trample
it
down
and
crush
it
24
As
for
the
ten
horns
ten
kings
will
rise
up
out
of
that
kingdom
and
still
another
one
will
rise
up
after
them
and
he
will
be
different
from
the
first
ones
and
he
will
humiliate
three
kings
25
He
will
speak
words
against
the
Most
High
and
he
will
continually
harass
the
holy
ones
of
the
Supreme
One
He
will
intend
to
change
times
and
law
and
they
will
be
given
into
his
hand
for
a
time
times
and
half
a
time
26
But
the
Court
sat
and
they
took
away
his
rulership
in
order
to
annihilate
him
and
to
destroy
him
completely
27
And
the
kingdom
and
the
rulership
and
the
grandeur
of
the
kingdoms
under
all
the
heavens
were
given
to
the
people
who
are
the
holy
ones
of
the
Supreme
One
Their
kingdom
is
an
everlasting
kingdom
and
all
rulerships
will
serve
and
obey
them
28
This
is
the
end
of
the
matter
As
for
me
Daniel
my
thoughts
alarmed
me
greatly
so
that
I
turned
pale
but
I
kept
the
matter
in
my
own
heart
1
In
the
third
year
of
the
kingship
of
King
Belshazzar
a
vision
appeared
to
me
Daniel
after
the
one
that
appeared
to
me
previously
2
I
saw
the
vision
and
as
I
watched
I
was
in
Shushan
the
citadel
which
is
in
the
province
of
Elam
I
viewed
the
vision
and
I
was
next
to
the
watercourse
of
Ulai
3
As
I
raised
my
eyes
look
there
was
a
ram
standing
before
the
watercourse
and
it
had
two
horns
The
two
horns
were
tall
but
one
was
higher
than
the
other
and
the
higher
one
came
up
later
4
I
saw
the
ram
making
thrusts
to
the
west
and
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
and
no
wild
beasts
could
stand
before
it
and
there
was
no
one
who
could
provide
rescue
from
its
power
It
did
as
it
pleased
and
exalted
itself
5
As
I
kept
watching
look
there
was
a
male
goat
coming
from
the
west
crossing
the
surface
of
the
whole
earth
without
touching
the
ground
And
the
goat
had
a
conspicuous
horn
between
its
eyes
6
It
was
coming
toward
the
ram
with
the
two
horns
which
I
had
seen
standing
before
the
watercourse
it
was
running
toward
it
in
a
powerful
rage
7
I
saw
it
closing
in
on
the
ram
and
it
was
filled
with
bitterness
toward
it
It
struck
down
the
ram
and
broke
its
two
horns
and
the
ram
was
powerless
to
stand
up
to
it
It
threw
the
ram
to
the
ground
and
trampled
it
down
and
there
was
no
one
to
rescue
it
from
its
power
8
Then
the
male
goat
exalted
itself
exceedingly
but
as
soon
as
it
became
mighty
the
great
horn
was
broken
then
four
conspicuous
horns
came
up
instead
of
the
one
toward
the
four
winds
of
the
heavens
9
Out
of
one
of
them
came
another
horn
a
small
one
and
it
grew
very
great
toward
the
south
and
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
Decoration
10
It
grew
so
great
that
it
reached
all
the
way
to
the
army
of
the
heavens
and
it
caused
some
of
the
army
and
some
of
the
stars
to
fall
to
the
earth
and
it
trampled
them
down
11
It
exalted
itself
even
against
the
Prince
of
the
army
and
from
him
the
constant
feature
was
taken
away
and
the
established
place
of
his
sanctuary
was
thrown
down
12
And
an
army
was
given
over
together
with
the
constant
feature
because
of
transgression
and
it
kept
throwing
truth
to
the
earth
and
it
acted
and
had
success
13
And
I
heard
a
holy
one
speaking
and
another
holy
one
said
to
the
one
speaking
How
long
will
the
vision
of
the
constant
feature
and
of
the
transgression
causing
desolation
continue
to
make
both
the
holy
place
and
the
army
things
to
trample
on
14
So
he
said
to
me
Until
2300
evenings
and
mornings
and
the
holy
place
will
certainly
be
restored
to
its
right
condition
15
While
I
Daniel
was
watching
the
vision
and
seeking
to
understand
it
suddenly
I
saw
standing
in
front
of
me
someone
who
appeared
to
be
a
man
16
Then
I
heard
the
voice
of
a
man
in
the
midst
of
the
Ulai
and
he
called
out
Gabriel
make
that
one
understand
what
he
saw
17
So
he
came
near
to
where
I
was
standing
but
when
he
came
I
was
so
terrified
that
I
fell
facedown
He
said
to
me
Understand
O
son
of
man
that
the
vision
is
for
the
time
of
the
end
18
But
while
he
was
speaking
with
me
I
fell
fast
asleep
with
my
face
to
the
ground
So
he
touched
me
and
made
me
stand
up
where
I
had
been
standing
19
Then
he
said
Here
I
am
causing
you
to
know
what
will
happen
in
the
final
part
of
the
denunciation
because
it
is
for
the
appointed
time
of
the
end
20
The
two-horned
ram
that
you
saw
stands
for
the
kings
of
Media
and
Persia
21
The
hairy
male
goat
stands
for
the
king
of
Greece
and
the
great
horn
that
was
between
its
eyes
stands
for
the
first
king
22
As
for
the
horn
that
was
broken
so
that
four
stood
up
instead
of
it
there
are
four
kingdoms
from
his
nation
that
will
stand
up
but
not
with
his
power
23
And
in
the
final
part
of
their
kingdom
as
the
transgressors
act
to
a
completion
a
fierce-looking
king
who
understands
ambiguous
sayings
will
stand
up
24
His
power
will
become
great
but
not
through
his
own
power
He
will
bring
ruin
in
an
extraordinary
way
and
he
will
be
successful
and
act
effectively
He
will
bring
mighty
ones
to
ruin
also
the
people
made
up
of
the
holy
ones
25
And
by
his
cunning
he
will
use
deception
to
succeed
and
in
his
heart
he
will
exalt
himself
and
during
a
time
of
security
he
will
bring
many
to
ruin
He
will
even
stand
up
against
the
Prince
of
princes
but
he
will
be
broken
without
human
hand
26
What
was
said
in
the
vision
about
the
evenings
and
the
mornings
is
true
but
you
must
keep
the
vision
secret
for
it
refers
to
a
time
many
days
from
now
27
As
for
me
Daniel
I
felt
exhausted
and
I
was
sick
for
some
days
Then
I
got
up
and
carried
out
the
kings
work
but
I
was
numbed
by
what
I
had
seen
and
no
one
could
understand
it
1
In
the
first
year
of
Darius
the
son
of
Ahasuerus—a
descendant
of
the
Medes
who
had
been
made
king
over
the
kingdom
of
the
Chaldeans—
2
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
I
Daniel
discerned
by
the
books
the
number
of
years
mentioned
in
the
word
of
Jehovah
to
Jeremiah
the
prophet
to
fulfill
the
desolation
of
Jerusalem
namely
70
years
3
So
I
turned
my
face
to
Jehovah
the
true
God
entreating
him
in
prayer
along
with
fasting
and
sackcloth
and
ashes
4
I
prayed
to
Jehovah
my
God
and
made
confession
and
said
O
Jehovah
the
true
God
the
great
and
awe-inspiring
One
who
keeps
his
covenant
and
shows
loyal
love
to
those
who
love
him
and
keep
his
commandments
5
we
have
sinned
and
done
wrong
and
acted
wickedly
and
rebelled
and
we
have
deviated
from
your
commandments
and
your
judgments
6
We
have
not
listened
to
your
servants
the
prophets
who
spoke
in
your
name
to
our
kings
our
princes
our
forefathers
and
all
the
people
of
the
land
7
To
you
O
Jehovah
belongs
righteousness
but
to
us
belongs
shame
as
is
the
case
today
to
the
men
of
Judah
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
and
all
Israel
those
nearby
and
far
away
in
all
the
lands
to
which
you
dispersed
them
because
they
acted
unfaithfully
toward
you
8
O
Jehovah
to
us
belongs
shame
to
our
kings
our
princes
and
our
forefathers
because
we
have
sinned
against
you
9
To
Jehovah
our
God
belong
mercy
and
forgiveness
for
we
have
rebelled
against
him
10
We
have
not
obeyed
the
voice
of
Jehovah
our
God
by
following
his
laws
that
he
set
before
us
through
his
servants
the
prophets
11
All
Israel
has
overstepped
your
Law
and
turned
away
by
not
obeying
your
voice
so
that
you
poured
out
on
us
the
curse
and
the
sworn
oath
written
about
in
the
Law
of
Moses
the
servant
of
the
true
God
for
we
have
sinned
against
Him
12
He
has
carried
out
his
words
that
he
spoke
against
us
and
against
our
rulers
who
ruled
over
us
by
bringing
great
calamity
on
us
nothing
has
ever
been
done
under
the
whole
heavens
such
as
what
was
done
in
Jerusalem
13
Just
as
it
is
written
in
the
Law
of
Moses
all
this
calamity
has
come
upon
us
yet
we
have
not
begged
for
the
favor
of
Jehovah
our
God
by
turning
away
from
our
error
and
by
showing
insight
into
your
truth
14
So
Jehovah
kept
watchful
and
brought
calamity
on
us
for
Jehovah
our
God
is
righteous
in
all
the
works
that
he
has
done
yet
we
have
not
obeyed
his
voice
15
Now
O
Jehovah
our
God
the
One
who
brought
your
people
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
by
a
mighty
hand
and
made
a
name
for
yourself
down
to
this
day
we
have
sinned
and
acted
wickedly
16
O
Jehovah
according
to
all
your
righteous
acts
please
may
your
anger
and
wrath
turn
away
from
your
city
Jerusalem
your
holy
mountain
for
because
of
our
sins
and
the
errors
of
our
forefathers
Jerusalem
and
your
people
are
an
object
of
reproach
to
all
those
around
us
17
And
now
listen
O
our
God
to
the
prayer
of
your
servant
and
to
his
entreaties
and
cause
your
face
to
shine
upon
your
sanctuary
that
is
desolate
for
your
own
sake
O
Jehovah
18
Incline
your
ear
O
my
God
and
hear
Do
open
your
eyes
and
see
our
desolate
condition
and
the
city
that
has
been
called
by
your
name
for
we
are
not
entreating
you
because
of
our
righteous
acts
but
because
of
your
great
mercy
19
O
Jehovah
do
hear
O
Jehovah
do
forgive
O
Jehovah
do
pay
attention
and
act
Do
not
delay
for
your
own
sake
O
my
God
for
your
own
name
has
been
called
upon
your
city
and
upon
your
people
20
While
I
was
still
speaking
and
praying
and
confessing
my
sin
and
the
sin
of
my
people
Israel
and
making
my
request
for
favor
before
Jehovah
my
God
concerning
the
holy
mountain
of
my
God
21
yes
while
I
was
yet
speaking
in
prayer
the
man
Gabriel
whom
I
had
previously
seen
in
the
vision
came
to
me
when
I
was
extremely
weary
at
about
the
time
of
the
evening
gift
offering
22
And
he
gave
me
understanding
saying
O
Daniel
now
I
have
come
to
give
you
insight
and
understanding
23
When
you
began
your
entreaty
the
word
went
out
and
I
have
come
to
report
it
to
you
because
you
are
someone
very
precious
So
consider
the
matter
and
understand
the
vision
24
There
are
70
weeks
that
have
been
determined
for
your
people
and
your
holy
city
in
order
to
terminate
the
transgression
to
finish
off
sin
to
make
atonement
for
error
to
bring
in
everlasting
righteousness
to
seal
up
the
vision
and
the
prophecy
and
to
anoint
the
Holy
of
Holies
25
You
should
know
and
understand
that
from
the
issuing
of
the
word
to
restore
and
to
rebuild
Jerusalem
until
Messiah
the
Leader
there
will
be
7
weeks
also
62
weeks
She
will
be
restored
and
rebuilt
with
a
public
square
and
moat
but
in
times
of
distress
26
And
after
the
62
weeks
Messiah
will
be
cut
off
with
nothing
for
himself
And
the
people
of
a
leader
who
is
coming
will
destroy
the
city
and
the
holy
place
And
its
end
will
be
by
the
flood
And
until
the
end
there
will
be
war
what
is
decided
upon
is
desolations
27
And
he
will
keep
the
covenant
in
force
for
the
many
for
one
week
and
at
the
half
of
the
week
he
will
cause
sacrifice
and
gift
offering
to
cease
And
on
the
wing
of
disgusting
things
there
will
be
the
one
causing
desolation
and
until
an
extermination
what
was
decided
on
will
be
poured
out
also
on
the
one
lying
desolate
1
In
the
third
year
of
King
Cyrus
of
Persia
a
revelation
was
given
to
Daniel
who
was
called
by
the
name
Belteshazzar
and
the
message
was
true
and
it
was
about
a
great
conflict
And
he
understood
the
message
and
was
given
understanding
about
what
he
had
seen
2
In
those
days
I
Daniel
had
been
mourning
for
three
full
weeks
3
I
ate
no
rich
food
and
no
meat
or
wine
entered
my
mouth
and
I
did
not
put
any
oil
on
myself
for
three
full
weeks
4
On
the
24th
day
of
the
first
month
while
I
was
on
the
bank
of
the
great
river
the
Tigris
5
I
looked
up
and
saw
a
man
clothed
in
linen
and
around
his
waist
was
a
belt
of
gold
from
Uphaz
6
His
body
was
like
chrysolite
his
face
had
the
appearance
of
lightning
his
eyes
were
like
fiery
torches
his
arms
and
his
feet
looked
like
burnished
copper
and
the
sound
of
his
words
was
like
the
sound
of
a
multitude
7
Only
I
Daniel
saw
the
vision
the
men
with
me
did
not
see
the
vision
However
a
great
trembling
seized
them
and
they
ran
away
and
hid
8
Then
I
was
left
by
myself
and
when
I
saw
this
great
vision
there
was
no
power
left
in
me
and
my
dignified
appearance
left
me
and
I
lost
all
strength
9
Then
I
heard
the
sound
of
him
speaking
but
when
I
heard
him
speaking
I
fell
fast
asleep
with
my
face
to
the
ground
10
But
then
a
hand
touched
me
and
it
stirred
me
to
get
up
on
my
hands
and
knees
11
Then
he
said
to
me
O
Daniel
you
very
precious
man
give
attention
to
the
words
that
I
am
about
to
speak
to
you
Now
stand
up
in
your
place
for
I
have
been
sent
to
you
When
he
said
this
to
me
I
stood
up
trembling
12
He
then
said
to
me
Do
not
be
afraid
O
Daniel
Your
words
have
been
heard
from
the
first
day
that
you
gave
your
heart
to
understanding
and
to
humbling
yourself
before
your
God
and
I
have
come
because
of
your
words
13
But
the
prince
of
the
royal
realm
of
Persia
stood
in
opposition
to
me
for
21
days
But
then
Michael
one
of
the
foremost
princes
came
to
help
me
and
I
remained
there
beside
the
kings
of
Persia
14
I
have
come
to
make
you
understand
what
will
befall
your
people
in
the
final
part
of
the
days
because
it
is
a
vision
yet
for
the
days
to
come
15
Now
when
he
spoke
these
words
to
me
I
turned
my
face
to
the
ground
and
became
speechless
16
Then
one
who
looked
like
a
man
touched
my
lips
and
I
opened
my
mouth
and
said
to
the
one
who
stood
in
front
of
me
My
lord
I
am
shuddering
because
of
the
vision
and
I
have
no
strength
17
So
how
can
my
lords
servant
speak
with
my
lord
For
now
I
have
no
strength
and
there
is
no
breath
left
in
me
18
The
one
who
looked
like
a
man
touched
me
again
and
strengthened
me
19
Then
he
said
Do
not
be
afraid
O
very
precious
man
May
you
have
peace
Be
strong
yes
be
strong
As
he
spoke
with
me
I
was
strengthened
and
I
said
Let
my
lord
speak
for
you
have
strengthened
me
20
Then
he
said
Do
you
know
why
I
have
come
to
you
Now
I
will
go
back
to
fight
with
the
prince
of
Persia
When
I
leave
the
prince
of
Greece
will
come
21
However
I
will
tell
you
the
things
recorded
in
the
writings
of
truth
There
is
no
one
strongly
supporting
me
in
these
things
but
Michael
your
prince
1
As
for
me
in
the
first
year
of
Darius
the
Mede
I
stood
up
to
strengthen
and
fortify
him
2
What
I
will
tell
you
now
is
the
truth
Look
Three
more
kings
will
stand
up
for
Persia
and
the
fourth
one
will
amass
greater
riches
than
all
others
And
when
he
becomes
strong
by
means
of
his
riches
he
will
rouse
up
everything
against
the
kingdom
of
Greece
3
And
a
mighty
king
will
stand
up
and
rule
with
extensive
dominion
and
do
as
he
pleases
4
But
when
he
has
stood
up
his
kingdom
will
be
broken
and
be
divided
toward
the
four
winds
of
the
heavens
but
not
to
his
descendants
and
not
like
the
dominion
with
which
he
ruled
for
his
kingdom
will
be
uprooted
and
go
to
others
besides
these
5
And
the
king
of
the
south
will
become
strong
that
is
one
of
his
princes
but
one
will
prevail
against
him
and
will
rule
with
extensive
dominion
greater
than
that
ones
ruling
power
6
After
some
years
they
will
make
an
alliance
and
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
south
will
come
to
the
king
of
the
north
in
order
to
make
an
equitable
arrangement
But
she
will
not
retain
the
power
of
her
arm
and
he
will
not
stand
nor
his
arm
and
she
will
be
given
up
she
and
those
bringing
her
in
and
the
one
who
caused
her
birth
and
the
one
making
her
strong
in
those
times
7
And
one
from
the
sprout
of
her
roots
will
stand
up
in
his
position
and
he
will
come
to
the
army
and
come
against
the
fortress
of
the
king
of
the
north
and
will
take
action
against
them
and
prevail
8
Also
with
their
gods
with
their
metal
images
with
their
desirable
articles
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
with
captives
he
will
come
to
Egypt
For
some
years
he
will
stand
off
from
the
king
of
the
north
9
who
will
come
against
the
kingdom
of
the
king
of
the
south
but
will
go
back
to
his
own
land
10
As
for
his
sons
they
will
prepare
for
war
and
assemble
a
vast
great
army
He
will
certainly
advance
and
sweep
through
like
a
flood
But
he
will
go
back
and
he
will
wage
war
all
the
way
to
his
fortress
11
And
the
king
of
the
south
will
become
bitter
and
will
go
out
and
fight
with
him
that
is
with
the
king
of
the
north
and
he
will
muster
a
large
crowd
but
the
crowd
will
be
given
into
that
ones
hand
12
And
the
crowd
will
be
carried
away
His
heart
will
become
exalted
and
he
will
cause
tens
of
thousands
to
fall
but
he
will
not
make
use
of
his
strong
position
13
And
the
king
of
the
north
will
return
and
muster
a
crowd
larger
than
the
first
and
at
the
end
of
the
times
after
some
years
he
will
surely
come
with
a
large
army
and
with
many
resources
14
In
those
times
many
will
stand
up
against
the
king
of
the
south
And
the
violent
ones
among
your
people
will
be
carried
along
to
try
making
a
vision
come
true
but
they
will
stumble
15
And
the
king
of
the
north
will
come
and
throw
up
a
siege
rampart
and
capture
a
fortified
city
And
the
arms
of
the
south
will
not
stand
nor
will
his
select
men
and
they
will
have
no
power
to
stand
16
The
one
coming
against
him
will
do
as
he
pleases
and
no
one
will
stand
before
him
He
will
stand
in
the
land
of
the
Decoration
and
ability
to
exterminate
will
be
in
his
hand
17
He
will
set
his
face
to
come
with
the
full
force
of
his
kingdom
and
there
will
be
equitable
terms
with
him
and
he
will
act
effectively
As
regards
the
daughter
of
women
it
will
be
granted
to
him
to
bring
her
to
ruin
And
she
will
not
stand
and
she
will
not
continue
to
be
his
18
He
will
turn
his
face
back
to
the
coastlands
and
will
capture
many
And
a
commander
will
make
the
reproach
from
him
cease
for
himself
so
that
his
reproach
will
not
be
He
will
make
it
turn
back
on
that
one
19
Then
he
will
turn
his
face
back
to
the
fortresses
of
his
own
land
and
he
will
stumble
and
fall
and
he
will
not
be
found
20
And
there
will
stand
up
in
his
position
one
who
causes
an
exactor
to
pass
through
the
splendid
kingdom
but
in
a
few
days
he
will
be
broken
though
not
in
anger
nor
in
warfare
21
And
there
will
stand
up
in
his
position
a
despised
one
and
they
will
not
give
him
the
majesty
of
the
kingdom
and
he
will
come
in
during
a
time
of
security
and
take
hold
of
the
kingdom
by
means
of
smoothness
22
And
the
arms
of
the
flood
will
be
swept
away
on
account
of
him
and
they
will
be
broken
as
will
be
the
Leader
of
the
covenant
23
And
because
of
their
alliance
with
him
he
will
carry
on
deception
and
rise
up
and
become
mighty
by
means
of
a
little
nation
24
During
a
time
of
security
he
will
come
into
the
richest
parts
of
the
province
and
do
what
his
fathers
and
their
fathers
have
not
done
Plunder
and
spoil
and
goods
he
will
distribute
among
them
and
against
fortified
places
he
will
plot
his
schemes
but
only
for
a
time
25
And
he
will
muster
his
power
and
his
heart
against
the
king
of
the
south
with
a
large
army
and
the
king
of
the
south
will
prepare
himself
for
the
war
with
an
exceedingly
large
and
mighty
army
And
he
will
not
stand
because
they
will
plot
schemes
against
him
26
And
those
eating
his
delicacies
will
bring
his
downfall
As
for
his
army
it
will
be
swept
away
and
many
will
fall
down
slain
27
As
regards
these
two
kings
their
heart
will
be
inclined
to
do
what
is
bad
and
they
will
sit
at
one
table
speaking
lies
to
each
other
But
nothing
will
succeed
because
the
end
is
yet
for
the
time
appointed
28
And
he
will
go
back
to
his
land
with
a
great
amount
of
goods
and
his
heart
will
be
against
the
holy
covenant
He
will
act
effectively
and
go
back
to
his
land
29
At
the
time
appointed
he
will
return
and
come
against
the
south
But
this
time
will
not
be
as
it
was
before
30
for
the
ships
of
Kittim
will
come
against
him
and
he
will
be
humbled
He
will
go
back
and
hurl
denunciations
against
the
holy
covenant
and
act
effectively
and
he
will
go
back
and
will
give
attention
to
those
leaving
the
holy
covenant
31
And
arms
will
stand
up
proceeding
from
him
and
they
will
profane
the
sanctuary
the
fortress
and
remove
the
constant
feature
And
they
will
put
in
place
the
disgusting
thing
that
causes
desolation
32
And
those
who
act
wickedly
against
the
covenant
he
will
lead
into
apostasy
by
means
of
smooth
words
But
the
people
who
know
their
God
will
prevail
and
act
effectively
33
And
those
having
insight
among
the
people
will
impart
understanding
to
the
many
And
they
will
be
made
to
stumble
by
sword
and
by
flame
by
captivity
and
by
plundering
for
some
days
34
But
when
they
are
made
to
stumble
they
will
be
given
a
little
help
and
many
will
join
with
them
by
means
of
smooth
speech
35
And
some
of
those
having
insight
will
be
made
to
stumble
in
order
to
do
a
refining
work
because
of
them
and
to
do
a
cleansing
and
a
whitening
until
the
time
of
the
end
because
it
is
yet
for
the
time
appointed
36
The
king
will
do
as
he
pleases
and
he
will
exalt
himself
and
magnify
himself
above
every
god
and
against
the
God
of
gods
he
will
speak
astonishing
things
And
he
will
prove
successful
until
the
denunciation
comes
to
a
finish
because
what
is
determined
must
take
place
37
He
will
show
no
regard
for
the
God
of
his
fathers
nor
will
he
show
regard
for
the
desire
of
women
or
for
any
other
god
but
he
will
magnify
himself
over
everyone
38
But
instead
he
will
give
glory
to
the
god
of
fortresses
to
a
god
that
his
fathers
did
not
know
he
will
give
glory
by
means
of
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
and
desirable
things
39
He
will
act
effectively
against
the
most
fortified
strongholds
along
with
a
foreign
god
He
will
give
great
glory
to
those
who
give
him
recognition
and
he
will
make
them
rule
among
many
and
the
ground
he
will
apportion
out
for
a
price
40
In
the
time
of
the
end
the
king
of
the
south
will
engage
with
him
in
a
pushing
and
against
him
the
king
of
the
north
will
storm
with
chariots
and
horsemen
and
many
ships
and
he
will
enter
into
the
lands
and
sweep
through
like
a
flood
41
He
will
also
enter
into
the
land
of
the
Decoration
and
many
lands
will
be
made
to
stumble
But
these
are
the
ones
that
will
escape
out
of
his
hand
Edom
and
Moab
and
the
main
part
of
the
Ammonites
42
And
he
will
keep
thrusting
out
his
hand
against
the
lands
and
as
regards
the
land
of
Egypt
she
will
not
escape
43
And
he
will
rule
over
the
hidden
treasures
of
gold
and
silver
and
over
all
the
desirable
things
of
Egypt
And
the
Libyans
and
the
Ethiopians
will
be
at
his
steps
44
But
reports
out
of
the
east
and
out
of
the
north
will
disturb
him
and
he
will
go
out
in
a
great
rage
to
annihilate
and
to
devote
many
to
destruction
45
And
he
will
plant
his
royal
tents
between
the
grand
sea
and
the
holy
mountain
of
Decoration
and
he
will
come
all
the
way
to
his
end
and
there
will
be
no
helper
for
him
1
During
that
time
Michael
will
stand
up
the
great
prince
who
is
standing
in
behalf
of
your
people
And
there
will
occur
a
time
of
distress
such
as
has
not
occurred
since
there
came
to
be
a
nation
until
that
time
And
during
that
time
your
people
will
escape
everyone
who
is
found
written
down
in
the
book
2
And
many
of
those
asleep
in
the
dust
of
the
earth
will
wake
up
some
to
everlasting
life
and
others
to
reproach
and
to
everlasting
contempt
3
And
those
having
insight
will
shine
as
brightly
as
the
expanse
of
heaven
and
those
bringing
the
many
to
righteousness
like
the
stars
forever
and
ever
4
As
for
you
Daniel
keep
the
words
secret
and
seal
up
the
book
until
the
time
of
the
end
Many
will
rove
about
and
the
true
knowledge
will
become
abundant
5
Then
I
Daniel
looked
and
saw
two
others
standing
there
one
on
this
bank
of
the
stream
and
one
on
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
6
Then
one
said
to
the
man
clothed
in
linen
who
was
up
above
the
waters
of
the
stream
How
long
will
it
be
to
the
end
of
these
marvelous
things
7
Then
I
heard
the
man
clothed
in
linen
who
was
up
above
the
waters
of
the
stream
as
he
raised
his
right
hand
and
his
left
hand
to
the
heavens
and
swore
by
the
One
who
is
alive
forever
It
will
be
for
an
appointed
time
appointed
times
and
half
a
time
As
soon
as
the
dashing
to
pieces
of
the
power
of
the
holy
people
comes
to
an
end
all
these
things
will
come
to
their
finish
8
Now
as
for
me
I
heard
but
I
could
not
understand
so
I
said
O
my
lord
what
will
be
the
outcome
of
these
things
9
Then
he
said
Go
Daniel
because
the
words
are
to
be
kept
secret
and
sealed
up
until
the
time
of
the
end
10
Many
will
cleanse
themselves
and
whiten
themselves
and
will
be
refined
And
the
wicked
ones
will
act
wickedly
and
none
of
the
wicked
will
understand
but
those
having
insight
will
understand
11
And
from
the
time
that
the
constant
feature
has
been
removed
and
the
disgusting
thing
that
causes
desolation
has
been
put
in
place
there
will
be
1290
days
12
Happy
is
the
one
who
keeps
in
expectation
and
who
arrives
at
the
1335
days
13
But
as
for
you
go
on
to
the
end
You
will
rest
but
you
will
stand
up
for
your
lot
at
the
end
of
the
days
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
that
came
to
Hosea
the
son
of
Beeri
in
the
days
of
Uzziah
Jotham
Ahaz
and
Hezekiah
kings
of
Judah
and
in
the
days
of
Jeroboam
son
of
Joash
the
king
of
Israel
2
When
Jehovah
started
to
speak
his
word
through
Hosea
Jehovah
said
to
Hosea
Go
marry
a
woman
of
prostitution
and
have
children
of
prostitution
because
by
prostitution
the
land
has
turned
completely
away
from
following
Jehovah
3
So
he
went
and
married
Gomer
the
daughter
of
Diblaim
and
she
conceived
and
bore
him
a
son
4
Then
Jehovah
said
to
him
Name
him
Jezreel
for
in
a
little
while
I
will
hold
an
accounting
against
the
house
of
Jehu
for
the
acts
of
bloodshed
of
Jezreel
and
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
royal
rule
of
the
house
of
Israel
5
In
that
day
I
will
break
the
bow
of
Israel
in
the
Valley
of
Jezreel
6
She
conceived
again
and
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
And
He
told
him
Name
her
Lo-ruhamah
for
I
will
no
longer
show
mercy
to
the
house
of
Israel
because
I
will
certainly
drive
them
away
7
But
I
will
show
mercy
to
the
house
of
Judah
and
I
will
save
them
by
Jehovah
their
God
I
will
not
save
them
by
bow
or
by
sword
or
by
war
or
by
horses
or
by
horsemen
8
After
weaning
Lo-ruhamah
she
conceived
and
gave
birth
to
a
son
9
Then
He
said
Name
him
Lo-ammi
because
you
are
not
my
people
and
I
will
not
be
yours
10
And
the
number
of
the
people
of
Israel
will
be
like
the
grains
of
sand
of
the
sea
which
cannot
be
measured
or
numbered
And
in
the
place
where
it
was
said
to
them
You
are
not
my
people

it
will
be
said
to
them
The
sons
of
the
living
God
11
And
the
people
of
Judah
and
of
Israel
will
be
gathered
together
into
unity
and
will
choose
for
themselves
one
head
and
go
up
out
of
the
land
for
great
will
be
the
day
of
Jezreel
1
Say
to
your
brothers
My
people
And
to
your
sisters
O
woman
shown
mercy

2
Accuse
your
mother
accuse
her
For
she
is
not
my
wife
and
I
am
not
her
husband
She
should
remove
her
prostitution
from
herselfAnd
her
adultery
from
between
her
breasts
3
Or
I
will
strip
her
naked
and
make
her
as
in
the
day
she
was
born
Making
her
like
a
wilderness
Reducing
her
to
a
waterless
land
And
causing
her
to
die
of
thirst

4
And
to
her
sons
I
will
not
show
mercy
For
they
are
the
sons
of
prostitution

5
For
their
mother
has
committed
prostitution
She
who
was
pregnant
with
them
has
acted
shamefully
for
she
said
I
will
go
after
my
passionate
lovers
Those
who
give
me
my
bread
and
my
water
My
wool
and
my
linen
my
oil
and
my
drink

6
So
I
will
block
your
way
with
a
hedge
of
thorns
And
I
will
raise
up
a
stone
wall
against
her
So
that
she
cannot
find
her
paths

7
She
will
chase
after
her
passionate
lovers
but
she
will
not
overtake
them
She
will
look
for
them
but
she
will
not
find
them
Then
she
will
say
I
will
go
back
to
my
first
husband
For
I
was
better
off
at
that
time
than
I
am
now

8
She
did
not
recognize
that
it
was
I
who
had
given
her
the
grain
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
And
I
who
had
given
her
silver
in
abundanceAnd
gold
which
they
used
for
Baal

9
Therefore
I
will
return
and
take
away
my
grain
in
its
timeAnd
my
new
wine
in
its
season
And
I
will
snatch
away
my
wool
and
my
linen
that
were
to
cover
her
nakedness
10
Now
I
will
expose
her
private
parts
in
full
view
of
her
passionate
lovers
And
no
man
will
rescue
her
out
of
my
hand
11
I
will
put
an
end
to
all
her
joy
Her
festivals
her
new
moons
her
sabbaths
and
all
her
festive
seasons
12
And
I
will
ruin
her
vines
and
her
fig
trees
of
which
she
has
said
These
are
my
wages
which
my
passionate
lovers
gave
to
me
I
will
turn
them
into
a
forest
And
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
will
devour
them
13
I
will
hold
an
accounting
against
her
for
the
days
when
she
offered
sacrifices
to
the
Baal
images
When
she
would
adorn
herself
with
her
rings
and
ornaments
and
would
chase
after
her
passionate
lovers
And
I
was
the
one
she
forgot

declares
Jehovah
14
So
I
will
persuade
her
I
will
lead
her
into
the
wilderness
And
I
will
speak
to
win
her
heart
15
I
will
give
her
vineyards
back
to
her
from
that
time
onward
And
the
Valley
of
Achor
as
a
gateway
to
hope
She
will
answer
there
as
in
the
days
of
her
youth
As
in
the
day
when
she
came
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
16
And
in
that
day

declares
Jehovah
You
will
call
me
My
husband
and
you
will
no
longer
call
me
My
master
17
I
will
remove
the
names
of
the
Baal
images
from
her
mouth
And
they
will
no
longer
be
remembered
by
their
name
18
In
that
day
I
will
make
a
covenant
for
them
with
the
wild
animals
of
the
field
And
with
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
the
creeping
things
of
the
ground
I
will
rid
the
land
of
the
bow
and
the
sword
and
war
And
I
will
make
them
lie
down
in
security
19
I
will
engage
myself
to
you
forever
And
I
will
engage
myself
to
you
in
righteousness
and
in
justice
In
loyal
love
and
in
mercy
20
I
will
engage
myself
to
you
in
faithfulness
And
you
will
certainly
know
Jehovah
21
In
that
day
I
will
answer

declares
Jehovah
I
will
answer
the
heavens
And
they
will
answer
the
earth
22
And
the
earth
will
answer
the
grain
and
the
new
wine
and
the
oil
And
they
will
answer
Jezreel
23
I
will
sow
her
like
seed
for
myself
in
the
earth
And
I
will
show
mercy
to
her
who
was
not
shown
mercy
I
will
say
to
those
not
my
people
You
are
my
people

And
they
will
say
You
are
my
God
1
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
Go
once
again
love
the
woman
who
is
loved
by
another
man
and
is
committing
adultery
just
as
Jehovah
loves
the
people
of
Israel
while
they
turn
to
other
gods
and
love
raisin
cakes
2
So
I
purchased
her
for
myself
for
15
silver
pieces
and
a
homer
measure
and
a
half
of
barley
3
Then
I
said
to
her
You
will
remain
mine
for
many
days
You
must
not
commit
prostitution
and
you
must
not
have
relations
with
another
man
and
I
will
behave
the
same
way
toward
you
4
It
is
because
for
a
long
time
the
people
of
Israel
will
dwell
without
a
king
without
a
prince
without
a
sacrifice
without
a
pillar
and
without
an
ephod
and
teraphim

Afterward
the
people
of
Israel
will
come
back
and
look
for
Jehovah
their
God
and
for
David
their
king
and
they
will
come
trembling
to
Jehovah
and
to
his
goodness
in
the
final
part
of
the
days
1
Hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
O
people
of
Israel
For
Jehovah
has
a
legal
case
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
Because
there
is
no
truth
nor
loyal
love
nor
knowledge
of
God
in
the
land

2
False
oaths
and
lying
and
murderAnd
stealing
and
adultery
are
widespread
And
one
act
of
bloodshed
follows
another
act
of
bloodshed

3
That
is
why
the
land
will
mournAnd
every
inhabitant
in
it
will
waste
away
The
wild
animals
of
the
field
and
the
birds
of
the
heavens
Even
the
fish
of
the
sea
will
perish

4
However
let
no
man
contend
or
reprove
For
your
people
are
like
those
who
contend
against
a
priest

5
So
you
will
stumble
in
broad
daylight
And
the
prophet
will
stumble
with
you
as
if
it
were
night
And
I
will
silence
your
mother

6
My
people
will
be
silenced
because
there
is
no
knowledge
Because
you
have
rejected
knowledge
I
will
also
reject
you
from
serving
as
my
priest
And
because
you
have
forgotten
the
law
of
your
God
I
myself
will
forget
your
sons

7
The
more
they
increased
the
more
they
sinned
against
me
I
will
change
their
glory
into
disgrace

8
They
feed
on
the
sin
of
my
people
And
they
are
greedy
for
their
error

9
It
will
be
the
same
for
the
people
as
for
the
priest
I
will
call
them
to
account
for
their
ways
And
I
will
bring
on
them
the
consequences
of
their
actions
10
They
will
eat
but
not
be
satisfied
They
will
be
promiscuous
but
they
will
not
increase
Because
they
have
shown
no
regard
for
Jehovah
11
Prostitution
and
wine
and
new
wineTake
away
the
motivation
to
do
what
is
right
12
My
people
consult
their
wooden
idols
Doing
what
their
staff
tells
them
Because
the
spirit
of
prostitution
causes
them
to
go
astray
And
by
their
prostitution
they
refuse
to
submit
to
their
God
13
On
the
tops
of
the
mountains
they
sacrifice
And
on
the
hills
they
make
sacrifices
smoke
Under
oak
trees
and
storax
trees
and
every
big
tree
Because
their
shade
is
good
That
is
why
your
daughters
commit
prostitutionAnd
your
daughters-in-law
commit
adultery
14
I
will
not
hold
an
accounting
against
your
daughters
because
of
their
prostitution
And
against
your
daughters-in-law
because
of
their
adultery
For
the
men
go
off
with
the
harlotsAnd
sacrifice
with
the
temple
prostitutes
Such
a
people
without
understanding
will
come
to
ruin
15
Although
you
are
committing
prostitution
O
Israel
Let
not
Judah
become
guilty
Do
not
come
to
Gilgal
or
to
Beth-aven
And
do
not
swear
As
surely
as
Jehovah
is
alive
16
For
like
a
stubborn
cow
Israel
has
become
stubborn
Will
Jehovah
now
shepherd
them
like
a
young
ram
in
an
open
pasture
17
Ephraim
is
joined
to
idols
Let
him
alone
18
When
their
beer
is
finished
They
become
promiscuous
And
her
rulers
dearly
love
dishonor
19
The
wind
will
wrap
her
in
its
wings
And
they
will
be
ashamed
of
their
sacrifices
1
Hear
this
you
priests
Pay
attention
O
house
of
Israel
Listen
O
house
of
the
king
For
the
judgment
involves
you
Because
you
are
a
trap
to
MizpahAnd
a
net
spread
over
Tabor

2
And
those
falling
away
have
sunk
deep
in
slaughter
And
I
am
warning
all
of
them

3
I
know
Ephraim
And
Israel
is
not
hidden
from
me
For
now
O
Ephraim
you
have
acted
promiscuously
Israel
has
defiled
itself

4
Their
dealings
do
not
permit
them
to
return
to
their
God
Because
there
is
a
spirit
of
prostitution
among
them
And
Jehovah
they
do
not
acknowledge

5
The
pride
of
Israel
has
testified
against
him
Both
Israel
and
Ephraim
have
stumbled
in
their
error
And
Judah
has
stumbled
with
them

6
With
their
flock
and
their
herd
they
went
to
look
for
Jehovah
But
they
could
not
find
him
He
had
drawn
away
from
them

7
They
have
betrayed
Jehovah
For
they
have
fathered
foreign
sons
Now
a
month
will
devour
them
and
their
portions

8
Blow
a
horn
in
Gibeah
a
trumpet
in
Ramah
Shout
a
war
cry
at
Beth-aven—after
you
O
Benjamin

9
O
Ephraim
you
will
become
an
object
of
horror
in
the
day
of
punishment
I
have
made
known
what
will
surely
happen
among
the
tribes
of
Israel
10
The
princes
of
Judah
are
like
those
moving
a
boundary
I
will
pour
out
my
fury
on
them
like
water
11
Ephraim
is
oppressed
crushed
by
judgment
For
he
was
determined
to
follow
after
his
adversary
12
So
I
was
like
a
moth
to
EphraimAnd
like
rottenness
to
the
house
of
Judah
13
When
Ephraim
saw
his
sickness
and
Judah
his
ulcer
Ephraim
went
to
Assyria
and
sent
to
a
great
king
But
he
was
unable
to
heal
you
And
he
could
not
cure
your
ulcer
14
For
I
will
be
like
a
young
lion
to
Ephraim
And
like
a
strong
lion
to
the
house
of
Judah
I
myself
will
tear
to
pieces
and
go
away
I
will
carry
them
off
and
no
one
will
rescue
them
15
I
will
go
away
and
return
to
my
place
until
they
bear
the
consequences
of
their
guilt
And
then
they
will
seek
my
favor
When
they
are
in
distress
they
will
seek
me
1
Come
and
let
us
return
to
Jehovah
For
he
has
torn
us
to
pieces
but
he
will
heal
us
He
struck
us
but
he
will
bind
our
wounds

2
He
will
revive
us
after
two
days
On
the
third
day
he
will
raise
us
up
And
we
will
live
before
him

3
We
will
know
we
will
earnestly
seek
to
know
Jehovah
His
going
out
is
as
certain
as
the
dawn
He
will
come
to
us
like
a
pouring
rain
Like
a
spring
rain
that
saturates
the
earth

4
What
should
I
do
with
you
Ephraim
What
should
I
do
with
you
Judah
For
your
loyal
love
is
like
the
morning
clouds
Like
the
dew
that
quickly
vanishes

5
That
is
why
I
will
cut
them
down
by
means
of
the
prophets
I
will
kill
them
with
the
words
of
my
mouth
And
the
judgments
on
you
will
shine
as
the
light

6
For
in
loyal
love
I
delight
not
in
sacrifice
And
in
the
knowledge
of
God
rather
than
in
whole
burnt
offerings

7
But
they
like
mere
men
have
violated
the
covenant
There
they
have
betrayed
me

8
Gilead
is
a
town
of
evildoers
Covered
with
footprints
of
blood

9
The
company
of
priests
are
like
marauder
bands
lying
in
ambush
for
a
man
They
murder
on
the
road
at
Shechem
For
their
conduct
is
shameful
10
I
have
seen
a
horrible
thing
in
the
house
of
Israel
There
Ephraim
practices
prostitution
Israel
has
defiled
itself
11
Furthermore
O
Judah
a
harvest
is
set
for
you
When
I
gather
back
the
captives
of
my
people
1
At
the
time
when
I
would
heal
Israel
The
error
of
Ephraim
is
also
exposed
And
the
wickedness
of
Samaria
For
they
practice
deception
Thieves
break
in
and
marauder
bands
raid
outside

2
But
they
do
not
say
in
their
heart
that
I
will
remember
all
their
wickedness
Now
their
dealings
are
all
around
them
They
are
right
in
front
of
my
face

3
They
make
the
king
rejoice
by
their
wickedness
And
princes
by
their
deceit

4
All
of
them
are
adulterers
Burning
like
an
oven
fired
by
a
baker
Who
stops
stirring
the
fire
after
kneading
the
dough
until
it
is
leavened

5
On
the
day
of
our
king
princes
have
become
sick—They
are
enraged
because
of
wine
He
has
reached
out
his
hand
to
ridiculers

6
For
they
approach
with
hearts
burning
like
an
oven
All
night
long
the
baker
sleeps
In
the
morning
the
oven
blazes
like
a
flaming
fire

7
All
of
them
are
hot
like
an
oven
And
they
devour
their
rulers
All
their
kings
have
fallen
No
one
among
them
calls
out
to
me

8
Ephraim
mixes
with
the
nations
Ephraim
is
like
a
round
cake
left
unturned

9
Strangers
have
consumed
his
strength
but
he
does
not
know
it
And
his
gray
hairs
have
turned
white
but
he
does
not
notice
it
10
The
pride
of
Israel
has
testified
against
him
But
they
have
not
returned
to
Jehovah
their
God
Nor
have
they
looked
for
him
despite
all
of
this
11
Ephraim
is
like
a
simpleminded
dove
lacking
good
sense
They
have
called
out
to
Egypt
they
have
gone
to
Assyria
12
Wherever
they
go
I
will
spread
my
net
over
them
I
will
bring
them
down
like
the
birds
of
the
heavens
I
will
discipline
them
according
to
the
warning
given
to
their
assembly
13
Woe
to
them
for
they
have
fled
from
me
Devastation
to
them
for
they
have
transgressed
against
me
I
was
ready
to
redeem
them
but
they
have
spoken
lies
against
me
14
From
their
heart
they
did
not
call
to
me
for
help
Although
they
kept
wailing
on
their
beds
For
their
grain
and
new
wine
they
would
slash
themselves
They
turn
against
me
15
Although
I
disciplined
them
and
strengthened
their
arms
They
are
against
me
scheming
what
is
bad
16
They
changed
course
but
not
to
anything
loftier
They
were
as
unreliable
as
a
loose
bow
Their
princes
will
fall
by
the
sword
because
of
their
defiant
tongues
For
this
they
will
be
an
object
of
ridicule
in
the
land
of
Egypt
1
Put
a
horn
to
your
mouth
One
comes
like
an
eagle
against
the
house
of
Jehovah
For
they
have
violated
my
covenant
and
transgressed
against
my
law

2
To
me
they
cry
out
My
God
we
Israel
know
you

3
Israel
has
rejected
what
is
good
Let
an
enemy
pursue
him

4
They
have
appointed
kings
but
not
through
me
They
have
appointed
princes
but
I
did
not
recognize
them
With
their
silver
and
their
gold
they
have
made
idols
To
their
own
destruction

5
Your
calf
has
been
rejected
O
Samaria
My
anger
flares
up
against
them
How
long
will
they
be
incapable
of
innocence

6
For
this
is
from
Israel
A
craftsman
made
it
and
it
is
not
God
The
calf
of
Samaria
will
be
reduced
to
splinters

7
For
it
is
wind
that
they
are
sowing
And
they
will
reap
a
storm
wind
No
stalk
produces
ripe
grain
Whatever
sprouts
produces
no
flour
If
any
is
produced
foreigners
will
swallow
it
down

8
Israel
will
be
swallowed
down
Now
they
will
be
among
the
nations
Like
an
unwanted
vessel

9
For
they
have
gone
up
to
Assyria
like
a
lone
wild
donkey
Ephraim
has
hired
lovers
10
Although
they
hire
them
from
among
the
nations
I
will
now
round
them
up
They
will
begin
to
suffer
because
of
the
burden
imposed
by
king
and
princes
11
For
Ephraim
has
multiplied
altars
to
sin
They
became
his
altars
for
sinning
12
I
wrote
for
him
the
many
things
of
my
law
But
they
were
regarded
as
something
strange
13
They
offer
sacrificial
gifts
to
me
and
they
eat
the
meat
But
Jehovah
takes
no
pleasure
in
them
Now
he
will
remember
their
error
and
punish
them
for
their
sins
They
have
turned
back
to
Egypt
14
Israel
has
forgotten
his
Maker
and
has
built
temples
And
Judah
has
multiplied
fortified
cities
But
I
will
send
fire
into
his
cities
And
it
will
consume
the
towers
of
each
one
1
Do
not
rejoice
O
Israel
Do
not
act
joyfully
like
the
peoples
For
by
prostitution
you
have
strayed
from
your
God
You
have
loved
the
wages
of
a
prostitute
on
every
threshing
floor
of
grain

2
But
the
threshing
floor
and
winepress
will
not
feed
them
And
new
wine
will
fail
her

3
They
will
not
continue
dwelling
in
the
land
of
Jehovah
Instead
Ephraim
will
return
to
Egypt
And
in
Assyria
they
will
eat
what
is
unclean

4
They
will
no
longer
pour
out
wine
offerings
to
Jehovah
Their
sacrifices
will
not
please
him
They
are
like
the
bread
of
mourning
All
those
eating
it
will
defile
themselves
For
their
bread
is
for
themselves
alone
It
will
not
come
into
the
house
of
Jehovah

5
What
will
you
do
in
the
day
of
meeting
In
the
day
of
Jehovahs
festival

6
For
look
they
will
have
to
flee
because
of
destruction
Egypt
will
gather
them
together
and
Memphis
will
bury
them
Nettles
will
take
possession
of
their
precious
things
of
silver
And
thornbushes
will
be
in
their
tents

7
The
days
of
reckoning
will
come
The
days
of
retribution
will
come
And
Israel
will
know
it
Their
prophet
will
be
a
fool
and
the
man
of
inspiration
will
go
mad
Because
your
error
is
abundant
the
animosity
against
you
is
abundant

8
The
watchman
of
Ephraim
was
with
my
God
But
now
all
the
ways
of
his
prophets
are
as
the
traps
of
a
birdcatcher
There
is
animosity
in
the
house
of
his
God

9
They
have
sunk
deep
into
ruin
as
in
the
days
of
Gibeah
He
will
remember
their
error
and
punish
their
sins
10
Like
grapes
in
the
wilderness
I
found
Israel
Like
the
first
of
the
early
figs
on
a
fig
tree
I
saw
your
forefathers
But
they
went
to
Baal
of
Peor
They
dedicated
themselves
to
the
shameful
thing
And
they
became
disgusting
like
the
object
of
their
love
11
Ephraims
glory
flies
away
like
a
bird
There
is
no
giving
birth
no
pregnancy
and
no
conception
12
Even
if
they
raise
children
I
will
bereave
them
until
no
man
is
left
Yes
woe
to
them
when
I
turn
away
from
them
13
Ephraim
planted
in
a
pasture
was
to
me
like
Tyre
Now
Ephraim
must
bring
his
sons
out
to
the
slaughter
14
Give
them
O
Jehovah
what
you
should
give
them
A
womb
that
miscarries
and
dry
breasts
15
All
their
wickedness
was
in
Gilgal
for
there
I
came
to
hate
them
I
will
drive
them
away
from
my
house
because
of
their
evil
deeds
I
will
no
longer
love
them
All
their
princes
are
stubborn
16
Ephraim
will
be
struck
down
Their
root
will
dry
up
and
they
will
produce
no
fruit
Even
if
they
give
birth
I
will
put
to
death
their
cherished
offspring
17
My
God
will
reject
them
For
they
have
not
listened
to
him
And
they
will
become
fugitives
among
the
nations
1
Israel
is
a
degenerate
vine
yielding
its
fruit
The
more
his
fruit
increases
the
more
he
multiplies
his
altars
The
better
his
land
produces
the
more
splendid
his
sacred
pillars

2
Their
heart
is
hypocritical
Now
they
will
be
found
guilty
There
is
one
who
will
break
their
altars
and
destroy
their
pillars

3
Now
they
will
say
We
have
no
king
for
we
have
not
feared
Jehovah
And
what
could
a
king
do
for
us

4
They
speak
empty
words
make
false
oaths
and
make
covenants
So
the
judgment
that
springs
up
is
like
poisonous
weeds
in
the
furrows
of
the
field

5
The
residents
of
Samaria
will
fear
for
the
calf
idol
of
Beth-aven
Its
people
will
mourn
over
it
As
will
its
foreign-god
priests
who
rejoiced
over
it
and
its
glory
For
it
will
go
away
from
them
into
exile

6
It
will
be
brought
to
Assyria
as
a
gift
to
a
great
king
Ephraim
will
be
put
to
shame
And
Israel
will
be
ashamed
because
of
the
advice
it
followed

7
Samaria
and
her
king
will
certainly
be
done
away
with
Like
a
snapped-off
twig
on
the
surface
of
waters

8
The
high
places
of
Beth-aven
the
sin
of
Israel
will
be
annihilated
Thorns
and
thistles
will
grow
on
their
altars
People
will
say
to
the
mountains
Cover
us
And
to
the
hills
Fall
over
us

9
From
the
days
of
Gibeah
you
have
sinned
O
Israel
There
they
have
persisted
War
did
not
overtake
the
sons
of
unrighteousness
in
Gibeah
10
I
will
also
discipline
them
when
I
please
And
peoples
will
be
gathered
against
them
When
their
two
errors
are
harnessed
on
them
11
Ephraim
was
a
trained
heifer
that
loved
to
thresh
So
I
spared
her
fair
neck
Now
I
will
make
someone
ride
Ephraim
Judah
will
plow
Jacob
will
harrow
for
him
12
Sow
seed
for
yourselves
in
righteousness
and
reap
loyal
love
Plow
for
yourselves
arable
landWhile
there
is
time
to
search
for
Jehovah
Until
he
comes
and
instructs
you
in
righteousness
13
But
you
have
plowed
wickedness
You
have
reaped
unrighteousness
And
you
have
eaten
the
fruitage
of
deception
For
you
have
trusted
in
your
own
way
In
the
multitude
of
your
warriors
14
An
uproar
will
rise
against
your
people
And
your
fortified
cities
will
all
be
devastated
Like
the
devastation
by
Shalman
of
the
house
of
Arbel
In
the
day
of
battle
when
mothers
were
dashed
to
pieces
alongside
their
children
15
This
is
what
will
be
done
to
you
O
Bethel
because
of
your
utter
wickedness
At
dawn
the
king
of
Israel
will
surely
be
done
away
with
1
When
Israel
was
a
boy
I
loved
him
And
out
of
Egypt
I
called
my
son

2
The
more
they
called
them
The
more
they
went
away
from
them
They
kept
sacrificing
to
the
Baal
imagesAnd
offering
sacrifices
to
the
graven
images

3
But
it
was
I
who
taught
Ephraim
to
walk
taking
them
in
my
arms
And
they
did
not
acknowledge
that
I
had
healed
them

4
With
the
ropes
of
men
I
kept
drawing
them
with
the
cords
of
love
And
I
was
to
them
like
one
lifting
a
yoke
from
their
jaws
And
I
gently
brought
food
to
each
one

5
They
will
not
return
to
the
land
of
Egypt
but
Assyria
will
be
their
king
Because
they
refused
to
return
to
me

6
And
a
sword
will
whirl
against
his
citiesAnd
destroy
his
bars
and
devour
them
because
of
their
schemes

7
My
people
are
bent
on
unfaithfulness
to
me
Though
they
called
them
upward
no
one
rises
up

8
How
can
I
give
you
up
O
Ephraim
How
can
I
hand
you
over
O
Israel
How
can
I
treat
you
like
Admah
How
can
I
make
you
like
Zeboiim
I
have
had
a
change
of
heart
At
the
same
time
my
compassions
are
stirred

9
I
will
not
vent
my
burning
anger
I
will
not
destroy
Ephraim
again
For
I
am
God
and
not
man
The
Holy
One
in
your
midst
And
I
will
not
come
against
you
in
fury
10
They
will
walk
after
Jehovah
and
he
will
roar
like
a
lion
When
he
roars
his
sons
will
come
trembling
from
the
west
11
They
will
tremble
like
a
bird
when
they
come
out
of
Egypt
Like
a
dove
out
of
the
land
of
Assyria
And
I
will
settle
them
in
their
houses

declares
Jehovah
12
Ephraim
has
surrounded
me
with
lies
And
the
house
of
Israel
with
deceit
But
Judah
still
roams
with
God
And
he
is
faithful
to
the
Most
Holy
One
1
Ephraim
is
feeding
on
wind
He
chases
after
the
east
wind
all
day
long
He
multiplies
lies
and
violence
They
make
a
covenant
with
Assyria
and
take
oil
to
Egypt

2
Jehovah
has
a
legal
case
against
Judah
He
will
call
for
an
accounting
against
Jacob
according
to
his
ways
And
he
will
repay
him
according
to
his
deeds

3
In
the
womb
he
seized
his
brother
by
the
heel
And
with
his
vigor
he
contended
with
God

4
He
kept
contending
with
an
angel
and
prevailed
He
wept
and
begged
for
his
favor
He
found
him
at
Bethel
and
there
He
spoke
with
us
5
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
Jehovah
is
his
memorial
name

6
So
return
to
your
God
Maintain
loyal
love
and
justice
And
always
hope
in
your
God

7
But
in
the
hand
of
the
tradesman
are
deceptive
scales
He
loves
to
defraud

8
Ephraim
keeps
saying
Indeed
I
have
become
rich
I
have
found
wealth
And
in
all
my
toil
they
will
not
find
anything
wrong
or
sinful

9
But
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
from
the
land
of
Egypt
I
will
again
make
you
dwell
in
tentsAs
in
the
days
of
an
appointed
time
10
I
spoke
to
the
prophets
I
multiplied
their
visions
And
I
spoke
parables
through
the
prophets
11
With
Gilead
there
has
been
deception
and
untruth
In
Gilgal
they
have
sacrificed
bulls
And
their
altars
are
like
piles
of
stones
in
the
furrows
of
the
field
12
Jacob
ran
away
to
the
territory
of
Aram
Israel
served
there
for
a
wife
And
for
a
wife
he
guarded
sheep
13
By
a
prophet
Jehovah
brought
Israel
up
from
Egypt
And
by
a
prophet
he
was
guarded
14
Ephraim
has
caused
bitter
offense
His
bloodguilt
remains
on
him
His
Lord
will
repay
him
for
his
reproach
1
When
Ephraim
spoke
there
was
trembling
He
was
prominent
in
Israel
But
he
became
guilty
with
regard
to
Baal
and
died

2
Now
they
add
to
their
sinAnd
make
metal
statues
from
their
silver
They
skillfully
make
idols
all
the
work
of
craftsmen
To
them
they
say
Let
the
men
who
sacrifice
kiss
the
calves

3
So
they
will
become
like
the
morning
clouds
Like
the
dew
that
vanishes
early
Like
chaff
blown
from
the
threshing
floor
by
a
storm
And
like
smoke
out
of
the
hole
in
the
roof

4
But
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
from
the
land
of
Egypt
You
knew
no
God
except
me
And
besides
me
there
is
no
savior

5
I
knew
you
in
the
wilderness
in
the
land
of
drought

6
They
were
satisfied
with
their
pastures
They
were
satisfied
and
their
heart
became
proud
And
so
they
forgot
me

7
I
will
become
like
a
young
lion
to
them
Like
a
leopard
lurking
along
the
path

8
I
will
come
upon
them
like
a
bear
that
has
lost
its
cubs
And
I
will
rip
open
their
chest
I
will
devour
them
there
like
a
lion
A
wild
beast
of
the
field
will
tear
them
to
pieces

9
It
will
destroy
you
O
Israel
Because
you
turned
against
me
against
your
helper
10
Where
then
is
your
king
that
he
may
save
you
in
all
your
cities
And
your
rulers
of
whom
you
said
Give
me
a
king
and
princes
11
I
gave
you
a
king
in
my
anger
And
I
will
take
him
away
in
my
fury
12
The
error
of
Ephraim
is
wrapped
up
His
sin
is
stored
up
13
The
pangs
of
childbirth
will
come
for
him
But
he
is
an
unwise
child
He
does
not
present
himself
when
it
is
time
to
be
born
14
From
the
power
of
the
Grave
I
will
redeem
them
From
death
I
will
recover
them
Where
are
your
stings
O
Death
Where
is
your
destructiveness
O
Grave
Compassion
will
be
concealed
from
my
eyes
15
Even
if
he
should
flourish
among
the
reeds
An
east
wind
will
come
the
wind
of
Jehovah
From
the
desert
it
comes
to
dry
up
his
well
and
drain
his
spring
That
one
will
pillage
the
treasury
of
all
his
precious
things
16
Samaria
will
be
held
guilty
for
she
has
rebelled
against
her
God
By
the
sword
they
will
fall
Their
children
will
be
dashed
to
pieces
And
their
pregnant
women
will
be
ripped
open
1
Come
back
O
Israel
to
Jehovah
your
God
For
you
have
stumbled
because
of
your
error

2
Come
back
to
Jehovah
with
these
words
Say
to
him
May
you
pardon
our
error
and
accept
what
is
good
And
we
will
offer
the
praise
of
our
lips
as
we
would
young
bulls

3
Assyria
will
not
save
us
We
will
not
ride
on
horses
And
we
will
no
longer
say
O
our
God
to
the
work
of
our
hands
For
it
is
by
you
that
the
fatherless
child
is
shown
mercy

4
I
will
heal
their
unfaithfulness
I
will
love
them
of
my
own
free
will
Because
my
anger
has
turned
away
from
him

5
I
will
become
like
the
dew
to
Israel
He
will
blossom
like
the
lilyAnd
will
send
down
his
roots
like
the
trees
of
Lebanon

6
His
twigs
will
spread
His
splendor
will
be
like
that
of
the
olive
tree
And
his
fragrance
like
that
of
Lebanon

7
They
will
again
dwell
in
his
shadow
They
will
grow
grain
and
will
bud
like
the
vine
His
fame
will
be
like
the
wine
of
Lebanon

8
Ephraim
will
say
What
more
do
I
have
to
do
with
idols
I
will
answer
and
watch
over
him
I
will
be
like
a
thriving
juniper
tree
From
me
your
fruit
will
be
found

9
Who
is
wise
Let
him
understand
these
things
Who
is
discreet
Let
him
know
them
For
the
ways
of
Jehovah
are
upright
And
the
righteous
will
walk
in
them
But
the
transgressors
will
stumble
in
them
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
that
came
to
Joel
the
son
of
Pethuel

2
Hear
this
you
elders
And
pay
attention
all
you
inhabitants
of
the
land
Has
anything
like
this
happened
in
your
daysOr
in
the
days
of
your
forefathers

3
Tell
about
it
to
your
sons
And
let
your
sons
tell
about
it
to
their
sons
And
their
sons
to
the
next
generation

4
What
was
left
by
the
devouring
locust
the
swarming
locust
has
eaten
And
what
was
left
by
the
swarming
locust
the
unwinged
locust
has
eaten
And
what
the
unwinged
locust
has
left
the
voracious
locust
has
eaten

5
Wake
up
you
drunkards
and
weep
Wail
all
you
wine
drinkers
Because
the
sweet
wine
has
been
taken
from
your
mouths

6
For
a
nation
has
come
up
into
my
land
mighty
and
without
number
Its
teeth
are
the
teeth
of
a
lion
and
its
jaws
are
those
of
a
lion

7
It
has
devastated
my
vine
and
turned
my
fig
tree
into
a
stump
Stripping
them
completely
bare
and
tossing
them
aside
Leaving
their
twigs
white

8
Wail
as
a
virgin
wearing
sackcloth
doesFor
the
bridegroom
of
her
youth

9
Grain
offering
and
drink
offering
have
ceased
from
the
house
of
Jehovah
The
priests
the
ministers
of
Jehovah
are
in
mourning
10
The
field
has
been
devastated
the
ground
mourns
For
the
grain
has
been
devastated
the
new
wine
has
dried
up
the
oil
has
failed
11
Farmers
are
dismayed
vinedressers
wail
Because
of
the
wheat
and
the
barley
For
the
harvest
of
the
field
has
perished
12
The
vine
has
dried
up
The
fig
tree
has
withered
The
pomegranate
the
palm
and
the
apple
All
the
trees
of
the
field
have
dried
up
For
joy
has
turned
to
shame
among
the
people
13
Put
on
sackcloth
and
mourn
you
priests
Wail
you
ministers
of
the
altar
Come
in
and
spend
the
night
in
sackcloth
you
ministers
of
my
God
For
grain
offering
and
drink
offering
have
been
withheld
from
the
house
of
your
God
14
Proclaim
a
fast
call
for
a
solemn
assembly
Gather
the
elders
together
with
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
To
the
house
of
Jehovah
your
God
and
cry
to
Jehovah
for
help
15
Woe
because
of
the
day
For
the
day
of
Jehovah
is
near
And
it
will
come
like
a
destruction
from
the
Almighty
16
Has
not
food
been
taken
from
before
our
very
eyes
And
rejoicing
and
joy
from
the
house
of
our
God
17
The
seeds
have
shriveled
under
their
shovels
Storehouses
are
desolate
Granaries
have
been
torn
down
for
the
grain
has
dried
up
18
Even
the
livestock
groan
The
herds
of
cattle
wander
in
confusion
for
they
have
no
pasture
And
the
flocks
of
sheep
bear
the
punishment
19
To
you
O
Jehovah
I
will
call
For
fire
has
devoured
the
pastures
of
the
wilderness
And
a
flame
has
consumed
all
the
trees
of
the
field
20
Even
the
wild
beasts
long
for
you
Because
the
streams
of
water
have
dried
upAnd
fire
has
devoured
the
pastures
of
the
wilderness
1
Blow
a
horn
in
Zion
Shout
a
war
cry
in
my
holy
mountain
Let
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
tremble
For
the
day
of
Jehovah
is
coming
It
is
near

2
It
is
a
day
of
darkness
and
gloom
A
day
of
clouds
and
thick
gloom
Like
light
of
dawn
spreading
out
on
the
mountains
There
is
a
people
numerous
and
mighty
Never
before
has
there
been
one
like
it
And
never
again
will
there
be
anotherThrough
the
years
of
all
generations

3
Ahead
of
it
a
fire
devours
And
behind
it
a
flame
consumes
The
land
ahead
of
it
is
like
the
garden
of
Eden
But
behind
it
is
a
desolate
wilderness
And
nothing
can
escape

4
Its
appearance
is
like
the
appearance
of
horses
And
they
run
like
warhorses

5
The
sound
is
like
that
of
chariots
as
they
leap
on
the
mountaintops
Like
the
crackling
of
a
blazing
fire
that
consumes
stubble
It
is
like
a
mighty
people
drawn
up
in
battle
formation

6
Because
of
them
peoples
will
be
in
anguish
Every
face
will
grow
flushed

7
They
charge
like
warriors
They
scale
a
wall
like
soldiers
Each
keeps
to
his
own
course
And
they
do
not
swerve
from
their
paths

8
They
do
not
shove
one
another
Each
man
advances
in
his
course
If
the
weapons
cause
some
to
fall
The
others
do
not
break
ranks

9
Into
the
city
they
rush
on
the
wall
they
run
Onto
the
houses
they
climb
through
the
windows
they
enter
like
a
thief
10
Before
them
the
land
trembles
and
the
heavens
rock
Sun
and
moon
have
become
dark
And
the
stars
have
lost
their
brightness
11
Jehovah
will
raise
his
voice
before
his
army
for
his
camp
is
very
numerous
For
the
one
carrying
out
His
word
is
mighty
For
the
day
of
Jehovah
is
great
and
very
awe-inspiring
Who
can
endure
it
12
Yet
even
now

declares
Jehovah
return
to
me
with
all
your
hearts
With
fasting
and
weeping
and
wailing
13
Rip
apart
your
hearts
and
not
your
garments
And
return
to
Jehovah
your
God
For
he
is
compassionate
and
merciful
slow
to
anger
and
abundant
in
loyal
love
And
he
will
reconsider
the
calamity
14
Who
knows
whether
he
will
turn
back
and
reconsiderAnd
leave
behind
a
blessing
A
grain
offering
and
a
drink
offering
for
Jehovah
your
God
15
Blow
a
horn
in
Zion
Proclaim
a
fast
call
for
a
solemn
assembly
16
Gather
the
people
sanctify
the
congregation
Collect
the
old
men
gather
the
children
and
nursing
infants
Let
the
bridegroom
go
out
from
his
inner
chamber
and
the
bride
from
her
bridal
chamber
17
Between
the
porch
and
the
altarLet
the
priests
the
ministers
of
Jehovah
weep
and
say
Do
feel
pity
O
Jehovah
for
your
people
Do
not
make
your
inheritance
an
object
of
scorn
Letting
the
nations
rule
over
them
Why
should
the
peoples
say
Where
is
their
God
18
Then
Jehovah
will
be
zealous
for
his
landAnd
show
compassion
on
his
people
19
Jehovah
will
answer
his
people
Here
I
am
sending
to
you
grain
and
new
wine
and
oil
And
you
will
be
fully
satisfied
I
will
no
longer
make
you
a
reproach
among
the
nations
20
I
will
drive
the
northerner
far
away
from
you
I
will
disperse
him
to
a
dry
and
desolate
wasteland
With
his
vanguard
toward
the
eastern
seaAnd
his
rear
guard
toward
the
western
sea
The
foul
smell
from
him
will
ascend
The
stench
from
him
will
keep
ascending
For
He
will
do
great
things
21
Do
not
be
afraid
O
land
Be
joyful
and
rejoice
for
Jehovah
will
do
great
things
22
Do
not
be
afraid
you
beasts
of
the
field
For
the
pastures
of
the
wilderness
will
become
green
And
the
trees
will
bear
fruit
The
fig
tree
and
the
vine
must
give
their
full
yield
23
You
sons
of
Zion
be
joyful
and
rejoice
in
Jehovah
your
God
For
he
will
give
you
the
autumn
rain
in
the
right
amount
And
he
will
send
upon
you
a
downpour
The
autumn
rain
and
the
spring
rain
as
before
24
The
threshing
floors
will
be
full
of
pure
grain
And
the
presses
will
overflow
with
new
wine
and
oil
25
And
I
will
make
compensation
to
you
for
the
yearsThat
the
swarming
locust
the
unwinged
locust
the
voracious
locust
and
the
devouring
locust
have
eaten
My
great
army
that
I
sent
among
you
26
You
will
surely
eat
to
satisfaction
And
you
will
praise
the
name
of
Jehovah
your
God
Who
has
done
wonders
in
your
behalf
My
people
will
never
again
be
put
to
shame
27
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
in
the
midst
of
IsraelAnd
that
I
am
Jehovah
your
God—there
is
no
other
My
people
will
never
again
be
put
to
shame
28
After
that
I
will
pour
out
my
spirit
on
every
sort
of
flesh
And
your
sons
and
your
daughters
will
prophesy
Your
old
men
will
dream
dreams
And
your
young
men
will
see
visions
29
And
even
on
my
male
slaves
and
female
slavesI
will
pour
out
my
spirit
in
those
days
30
And
I
will
give
wonders
in
the
heavens
and
on
the
earth
Blood
and
fire
and
columns
of
smoke
31
The
sun
will
be
turned
into
darkness
and
the
moon
into
bloodBefore
the
coming
of
the
great
and
awe-inspiring
day
of
Jehovah
32
And
everyone
who
calls
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
will
be
saved
For
on
Mount
Zion
and
in
Jerusalem
there
will
be
those
who
escape
just
as
Jehovah
has
said
The
survivors
whom
Jehovah
calls
1
For
look
in
those
days
and
in
that
time
When
I
bring
back
the
captives
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
2
I
will
also
gather
together
all
the
nationsAnd
bring
them
down
to
the
Valley
of
Jehoshaphat
I
will
enter
into
judgment
with
them
thereIn
behalf
of
my
people
and
my
inheritance
Israel
For
they
scattered
them
among
the
nations
And
they
divided
up
my
land
among
themselves

3
For
my
people
they
cast
lots
They
would
trade
a
boy
to
hire
a
prostituteAnd
sell
a
girl
for
wine
to
drink

4
Also
what
do
you
have
against
me
O
Tyre
and
Sidon
and
all
the
regions
of
Philistia
Are
you
repaying
me
for
something
If
you
are
repaying
me
I
will
swiftly
speedily
bring
your
repayment
on
your
heads

5
Because
you
have
taken
my
silver
and
gold
And
you
have
brought
my
finest
treasures
into
your
temples
6
And
the
people
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
you
have
sold
to
the
Greeks
In
order
to
remove
them
far
from
their
territory
7
Here
I
am
rousing
them
to
come
from
the
place
where
you
sold
them
And
I
will
bring
your
repayment
on
your
heads

8
I
will
sell
your
sons
and
daughters
into
the
hand
of
the
people
of
Judah
And
they
will
sell
them
to
the
men
of
Sheba
to
a
nation
far
away
For
Jehovah
himself
has
spoken
it

9
Proclaim
this
among
the
nations
Prepare
for
war
Stir
up
the
mighty
men
Let
all
the
soldiers
draw
near
let
them
advance
10
Beat
your
plowshares
into
swords
and
your
pruning
shears
into
spears
Let
the
weak
one
say
I
am
powerful
11
Come
and
help
all
you
surrounding
nations
assemble
together
To
that
place
O
Jehovah
bring
down
your
powerful
ones
12
Let
the
nations
be
roused
and
come
up
to
the
Valley
of
Jehoshaphat
For
there
I
will
sit
in
order
to
judge
all
the
surrounding
nations
13
Thrust
in
a
sickle
for
the
harvest
is
ripe
Come
down
and
tread
for
the
winepress
is
full
The
vats
overflow
for
their
badness
is
abundant
14
Crowds
crowds
are
in
the
valley
of
the
decision
For
the
day
of
Jehovah
is
near
in
the
valley
of
the
decision
15
Sun
and
moon
will
become
dark
And
the
stars
will
lose
their
brightness
16
And
Jehovah
will
roar
out
of
Zion
Out
of
Jerusalem
he
will
raise
his
voice
And
heaven
and
earth
will
rock
But
Jehovah
will
be
a
refuge
for
his
people
A
fortress
for
the
people
of
Israel
17
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
I
am
Jehovah
your
God
residing
in
Zion
my
holy
mountain
Jerusalem
will
become
a
holy
place
And
strangers
will
pass
through
her
no
more
18
In
that
day
the
mountains
will
drip
with
sweet
wine
The
hills
will
flow
with
milk
And
the
streams
of
Judah
will
all
flow
with
water
Out
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
a
spring
will
flow
And
it
will
irrigate
the
Valley
of
the
Acacia
Trees
19
But
Egypt
will
become
desolate
And
Edom
will
be
a
desolate
wilderness
Because
of
the
violence
done
to
the
people
of
Judah
In
whose
land
they
shed
innocent
blood
20
But
Judah
will
always
be
inhabited
And
Jerusalem
to
generation
after
generation
21
I
will
consider
innocent
their
blood
that
I
had
not
considered
innocent
And
Jehovah
will
reside
in
Zion
1
The
words
of
Amos
who
was
among
the
sheep
raisers
from
Tekoa
which
he
received
in
vision
concerning
Israel
in
the
days
of
King
Uzziah
of
Judah
and
in
the
days
of
Jeroboam
son
of
Joash
the
king
of
Israel
two
years
before
the
earthquake
2
He
said
Jehovah
will
roar
out
of
Zion
And
he
will
raise
his
voice
out
of
Jerusalem
The
pastures
of
the
shepherds
will
mourn
And
the
summit
of
Carmel
will
dry
up

3
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
For
three
revolts
of
Damascus
and
for
four
I
will
not
reverse
it
Because
they
threshed
Gilead
with
iron
threshing
sledges

4
So
I
will
send
a
fire
upon
the
house
of
Hazael
And
it
will
consume
the
fortified
towers
of
Ben-hadad

5
I
will
break
the
bars
of
Damascus
I
will
destroy
the
inhabitants
from
Bikath-avenAnd
the
one
ruling
from
Beth-eden
And
the
people
of
Syria
will
go
as
exiles
to
Kir

says
Jehovah

6
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
For
three
revolts
of
Gaza
and
for
four
I
will
not
reverse
it
Because
they
took
a
whole
group
of
exiles
to
hand
them
over
to
Edom

7
So
I
will
send
a
fire
onto
the
wall
of
Gaza
And
it
will
consume
her
fortified
towers

8
I
will
destroy
the
inhabitants
from
Ashdod
And
the
one
ruling
from
Ashkelon
I
will
turn
my
hand
against
Ekron
And
the
remaining
Philistines
will
perish

says
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah

9
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
For
three
revolts
of
Tyre
and
for
four
I
will
not
reverse
it
Because
they
handed
over
a
whole
group
of
exiles
to
Edom
And
because
they
did
not
remember
the
covenant
of
brothers
10
So
I
will
send
a
fire
onto
the
wall
of
Tyre
And
it
will
consume
her
fortified
towers
11
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
For
three
revolts
of
Edom
and
for
four
I
will
not
reverse
it
Because
he
pursued
his
own
brother
with
the
sword
And
because
he
refused
to
show
mercy
In
his
anger
he
keeps
tearing
them
apart
relentlessly
And
he
remains
furious
with
them
continually
12
So
I
will
send
a
fire
into
Teman
And
it
will
consume
the
fortified
towers
of
Bozrah
13
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
For
three
revolts
of
the
Ammonites
and
for
four
I
will
not
reverse
it
Because
they
ripped
open
the
pregnant
women
of
Gilead
to
widen
out
their
own
territory
14
So
I
will
set
fire
to
the
wall
of
Rabbah
And
it
will
consume
her
fortified
towers
With
a
war
cry
in
the
day
of
battle
With
a
tempest
in
the
day
of
storm
wind
15
And
their
king
will
go
into
exile
together
with
his
princes

says
Jehovah
1
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
For
three
revolts
of
Moab
and
for
four
I
will
not
reverse
it
Because
he
burned
the
bones
of
the
king
of
Edom
for
lime

2
So
I
will
send
a
fire
into
Moab
And
it
will
consume
the
fortified
towers
of
Kerioth
Moab
will
die
amid
an
uproar
With
a
war
cry
with
the
sound
of
a
horn

3
I
will
remove
the
ruler
from
her
midstAnd
kill
all
her
princes
along
with
him

says
Jehovah

4
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
For
three
revolts
of
Judah
and
for
four
I
will
not
reverse
it
Because
they
rejected
the
law
of
Jehovah
And
because
they
did
not
keep
his
regulations
But
the
same
lies
their
forefathers
followed
have
led
them
astray

5
So
I
will
send
a
fire
into
Judah
And
it
will
consume
the
fortified
towers
of
Jerusalem

6
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
For
three
revolts
of
Israel
and
for
four
I
will
not
reverse
it
Because
they
sell
the
righteous
for
silver
And
the
poor
for
a
pair
of
sandals

7
They
trample
the
heads
of
the
lowly
into
the
dust
of
the
earth
And
they
block
the
path
of
the
meek
A
man
and
his
father
have
relations
with
the
same
girl
Profaning
my
holy
name

8
They
stretch
out
next
to
every
altar
on
garments
they
seized
as
security
for
a
loan
And
the
wine
they
drink
at
the
house
of
their
gods
was
obtained
from
those
they
fined

9
But
it
was
I
who
annihilated
the
Amorite
before
them
Who
was
as
tall
as
the
cedars
and
as
strong
as
the
oaks
I
destroyed
his
fruit
above
and
his
roots
below
10
I
brought
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
And
I
made
you
walk
through
the
wilderness
40
years
To
take
possession
of
the
land
of
the
Amorite
11
I
raised
up
some
of
your
sons
as
prophetsAnd
some
of
your
young
men
as
Nazirites
Is
this
not
so
O
people
of
Israel
declares
Jehovah
12
But
you
kept
giving
the
Nazirites
wine
to
drink
And
you
commanded
the
prophets
You
must
not
prophesy
13
So
I
will
crush
you
in
your
place
Just
as
a
wagon
loaded
with
cut
grain
crushes
what
is
under
it
14
The
swift
one
will
have
no
place
to
flee
The
strong
one
will
not
retain
his
power
And
no
warrior
will
escape
with
his
life
15
The
bowman
will
not
stand
his
ground
The
swift
of
foot
will
not
escape
And
the
horseman
will
not
escape
with
his
life
16
Even
the
most
courageous
among
the
warriorsWill
flee
naked
in
that
day

declares
Jehovah
1
Hear
this
word
that
Jehovah
has
spoken
concerning
you
O
people
of
Israel
concerning
the
whole
family
that
I
brought
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt

2
You
alone
I
have
known
out
of
all
the
families
of
the
earth
That
is
why
I
will
call
you
to
account
for
all
your
errors

3
Will
two
walk
together
unless
they
have
agreed
to
meet

4
Will
a
lion
roar
in
the
forest
when
it
has
no
prey
Will
a
young
lion
growl
from
its
lair
when
it
has
caught
nothing

5
Will
a
bird
fall
into
a
trap
on
the
ground
when
there
is
no
snare
for
it
Does
a
trap
spring
up
from
the
ground
when
it
has
caught
nothing

6
If
a
horn
is
blown
in
a
city
do
the
people
not
tremble
If
a
calamity
occurs
in
the
city
is
it
not
Jehovah
who
has
acted

7
For
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
will
not
do
a
thingUnless
he
has
revealed
his
confidential
matter
to
his
servants
the
prophets

8
The
lion
has
roared
Who
will
not
be
afraid
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
has
spoken
Who
will
not
prophesy

9
Proclaim
it
on
the
fortified
towers
of
AshdodAnd
on
the
fortified
towers
in
the
land
of
Egypt
Say
Gather
together
against
the
mountains
of
Samaria
See
the
turmoil
in
her
midstAnd
the
defrauding
within
her
10
For
they
do
not
know
how
to
do
what
is
right

declares
Jehovah
Those
who
are
storing
up
violence
and
destruction
in
their
fortified
towers
11
Therefore
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
An
adversary
will
surround
the
land
He
will
strip
you
of
your
strength
And
your
fortified
towers
will
be
plundered
12
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Just
as
the
shepherd
snatches
away
two
legs
or
a
piece
of
an
ear
from
the
mouth
of
the
lion
That
is
how
the
people
of
Israel
will
be
snatched
away
Those
now
sitting
in
Samaria
on
splendid
beds
and
on
fine
couches
13
Hear
and
warn
the
house
of
Jacob

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
14
For
in
the
day
I
call
Israel
to
account
for
all
his
revolts
I
will
also
call
for
an
accounting
against
the
altars
of
Bethel
The
horns
of
the
altar
will
be
cut
off
and
fall
to
the
earth
15
I
will
strike
down
the
winter
house
along
with
the
summer
house
The
houses
of
ivory
will
perish
And
the
great
houses
will
come
to
their
end

declares
Jehovah
1
Hear
this
word
you
cows
of
Bashan
Who
are
on
the
mountain
of
Samaria
You
women
who
are
defrauding
the
lowly
and
crushing
the
poor
Who
say
to
their
husbands
Bring
us
something
to
drink

2
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
has
sworn
by
his
holiness
Look
The
days
are
coming
upon
you
when
he
will
lift
you
up
with
butcher
hooksAnd
the
rest
of
you
with
fishhooks

3
You
will
go
out
through
the
breaches
in
the
wall
each
one
straight
ahead
And
you
will
be
cast
out
to
Harmon

declares
Jehovah

4
Come
to
Bethel
and
commit
transgression
To
Gilgal
and
transgress
even
more
Bring
your
sacrifices
in
the
morning
And
your
tithes
on
the
third
day

5
Burn
a
thanksgiving
sacrifice
of
leavened
bread
Loudly
proclaim
your
voluntary
offerings
For
that
is
what
you
love
to
do
O
people
of
Israel

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah

6
And
for
my
part
I
made
your
teeth
clean
of
food
in
all
your
citiesAnd
caused
a
lack
of
bread
in
all
your
houses
But
you
did
not
come
back
to
me

declares
Jehovah

7
I
also
withheld
rain
from
you
three
months
before
the
harvest
I
made
it
rain
on
one
city
but
not
on
another
city
One
plot
of
land
would
have
rain
But
another
plot
of
land
where
there
was
no
rain
would
dry
up

8
People
of
two
or
three
cities
staggered
to
one
city
to
drink
water
And
they
would
not
get
satisfied
But
you
did
not
come
back
to
me

declares
Jehovah

9
I
struck
you
with
scorching
heat
and
mildew
You
multiplied
your
gardens
and
vineyards
But
the
locust
would
devour
your
fig
trees
and
olive
trees
And
you
still
did
not
come
back
to
me

declares
Jehovah
10
I
sent
among
you
a
pestilence
like
that
of
Egypt
With
the
sword
I
killed
your
young
men
and
captured
your
horses
I
made
the
stench
of
your
camps
rise
up
into
your
nostrils
But
you
did
not
come
back
to
me

declares
Jehovah
11
I
caused
an
overthrow
among
youLike
Gods
overthrow
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
And
you
were
like
a
log
snatched
out
of
the
fire
But
you
did
not
come
back
to
me

declares
Jehovah
12
So
that
is
what
I
will
do
to
you
O
Israel
Because
this
is
what
I
will
do
to
you
Get
ready
to
meet
your
God
O
Israel
13
For
look
he
is
the
One
who
formed
the
mountains
and
created
the
wind
He
tells
man
what
His
thoughts
are
He
turns
the
dawn
into
darkness
And
he
treads
on
earths
high
places
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
is
his
name
1
Hear
this
word
that
I
am
taking
up
against
you
as
a
dirge
O
house
of
Israel

2
The
virgin
Israel
has
fallen
She
cannot
get
up
again
She
has
been
abandoned
on
her
own
ground
There
is
no
one
to
raise
her
up
3
For
this
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
The
city
that
marches
out
with
a
thousand
will
have
a
hundred
left
And
the
one
that
goes
out
with
a
hundred
will
have
ten
left
for
the
house
of
Israel
4
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
to
the
house
of
Israel
Search
for
me
and
keep
living

5
Do
not
search
for
Bethel
Do
not
go
to
Gilgal
or
pass
over
to
Beer-sheba
For
Gilgal
will
certainly
go
into
exile
And
Bethel
will
come
to
nothing

6
Search
for
Jehovah
and
keep
living
So
that
he
does
not
burst
out
like
a
fire
on
the
house
of
Joseph
Consuming
Bethel
with
no
one
to
extinguish
it

7
You
turn
justice
into
wormwood
And
you
cast
righteousness
to
the
earth

8
The
One
who
made
the
Kimah
constellation
and
the
Kesil
constellation
The
One
who
turns
deep
shadow
into
morning
The
One
who
makes
day
as
dark
as
night
The
One
who
summons
the
waters
of
the
seaTo
pour
them
out
on
the
surface
of
the
earth—Jehovah
is
his
name

9
He
will
cause
destruction
to
burst
out
against
the
strong
Bringing
destruction
on
fortified
places
10
They
hate
those
who
give
reproof
in
the
city
gate
And
they
detest
those
who
speak
truthfully
11
Because
you
demand
farm
rent
from
the
poorAnd
you
take
his
grain
as
tribute
You
will
not
keep
dwelling
in
the
houses
of
hewn
stone
that
you
have
builtNor
drink
the
wine
from
the
choice
vineyards
that
you
have
planted
12
For
I
know
how
many
your
revolts
areAnd
how
great
your
sins
are—You
harass
the
righteous
You
take
bribes
And
you
deny
the
rights
of
the
poor
in
the
city
gate
13
Therefore
those
with
insight
will
keep
silent
at
that
time
For
it
will
be
a
time
of
calamity
14
Search
for
what
is
good
and
not
what
is
bad
So
that
you
may
keep
living
Then
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
may
be
with
you
Just
as
you
say
he
is
15
Hate
what
is
bad
and
love
what
is
good
Let
justice
prevail
in
the
city
gate
It
may
be
that
Jehovah
the
God
of
armiesWill
show
favor
to
the
remaining
ones
of
Joseph
16
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
Jehovah
says
In
all
the
public
squares
there
will
be
wailing
And
in
all
the
streets
they
will
say
Alas
alas
They
will
call
on
the
farmers
to
mournAnd
the
professional
mourners
to
wail
17
In
every
vineyard
there
will
be
wailing
For
I
will
pass
through
your
midst

says
Jehovah
18
Woe
to
those
who
yearn
for
the
day
of
Jehovah
What
then
will
the
day
of
Jehovah
mean
for
you
It
will
be
darkness
and
not
light
19
It
will
be
like
a
man
who
flees
from
a
lion
and
is
confronted
by
a
bear
And
when
he
enters
his
house
and
leans
his
hand
against
the
wall
a
snake
bites
him
20
Will
not
the
day
of
Jehovah
be
darkness
and
not
light
Will
it
not
have
gloom
and
not
brightness
21
I
hate
I
despise
your
festivals
And
I
take
no
pleasure
in
the
aroma
of
your
solemn
assemblies
22
Even
if
you
offer
me
whole
burnt
offerings
and
gift
offerings
I
will
find
no
pleasure
in
them
And
I
will
not
look
with
favor
on
your
communion
sacrifices
of
fattened
animals
23
Spare
me
the
din
of
your
songs
And
let
me
not
hear
the
melodies
of
your
stringed
instruments
24
Let
justice
flow
down
like
waters
And
righteousness
like
an
ever-flowing
stream
25
Did
you
bring
me
sacrifices
and
gift
offeringsFor
those
40
years
in
the
wilderness
O
house
of
Israel
26
Now
you
will
have
to
carry
away
Sakkuth
your
king
and
Kaiwan
Your
images
the
star
of
your
god
whom
you
made
for
yourselves
27
And
I
will
send
you
into
exile
beyond
Damascus

says
he
whose
name
is
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
1
Woe
to
the
self-assured
ones
in
Zion
To
those
feeling
secure
in
the
mountain
of
Samaria
The
prominent
men
of
the
foremost
of
nations
Those
to
whom
the
house
of
Israel
comes

2
Cross
over
to
Calneh
and
see
Go
from
there
to
Great
Hamath
And
go
down
to
Gath
of
the
Philistines
Are
they
better
than
these
kingdoms
Or
is
their
territory
larger
than
yours

3
Are
you
putting
out
of
your
mind
the
day
of
calamityAnd
bringing
in
a
reign
of
violence

4
They
lie
on
beds
of
ivory
and
sprawl
out
on
couches
Eating
the
rams
of
the
flock
and
the
fattened
calves
5
They
improvise
songs
to
the
sound
of
the
harp
And
like
David
they
invent
musical
instruments
6
They
drink
wine
by
the
bowlfulAnd
anoint
themselves
with
the
choicest
oils
But
they
are
unconcerned
about
the
catastrophe
of
Joseph

7
So
they
will
go
into
exile
at
the
head
of
the
exiles
And
the
revelry
of
those
sprawled
out
will
come
to
an
end

8
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
has
sworn
by
himself

declares
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
I
detest
the
pride
of
Jacob
I
hate
his
fortified
towers
And
I
will
hand
over
the
city
and
what
fills
it
9
And
if
ten
men
are
left
in
one
house
they
will
also
die
10
A
relative
will
come
to
carry
them
out
and
burn
them
one
by
one
He
will
bring
their
bones
out
from
the
house
then
he
will
say
to
whoever
is
in
the
inner
rooms
of
the
house
Are
there
any
more
with
you
And
he
will
say
Nobody
Then
he
will
say
Keep
silent
For
it
is
not
the
time
to
make
any
mention
of
the
name
of
Jehovah
11
For
it
is
Jehovah
giving
the
command
And
he
will
strike
down
the
great
house
into
rubble
And
the
small
house
into
debris
12
Do
horses
run
on
a
crag
Or
will
one
plow
there
with
cattle
For
you
have
turned
justice
into
a
poisonous
plant
And
the
fruit
of
righteousness
into
wormwood
13
You
rejoice
over
what
is
worthless
And
you
say
Have
we
not
become
powerful
in
our
own
strength
14
Therefore
O
house
of
Israel
I
will
bring
against
you
a
nation

declares
Jehovah
the
God
of
armies
And
they
will
oppress
you
from
Lebo-hamath
down
to
the
Wadi
of
the
Arabah
1
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
showed
me
Look
He
formed
a
locust
swarm
when
the
late
crop
was
beginning
to
come
up
This
was
the
later
crop
after
the
kings
hay
had
been
cut
2
When
the
swarm
finished
eating
up
the
vegetation
of
the
land
I
said
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
please
forgive
How
can
Jacob
survive
For
he
is
weak
3
So
Jehovah
reconsidered
this
It
will
not
happen

Jehovah
said
4
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
showed
me
Look
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
called
for
a
punishment
by
fire
It
consumed
the
vast
deep
waters
and
it
consumed
a
portion
of
the
land
5
Then
I
said
O
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
please
hold
this
back
How
can
Jacob
survive
For
he
is
weak
6
So
Jehovah
reconsidered
this
That
too
will
not
happen

the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
said
7
This
is
what
he
showed
me
Look
Jehovah
was
standing
on
a
wall
made
with
a
plumb
line
and
there
was
a
plumb
line
in
his
hand
8
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
What
do
you
see
Amos
So
I
said
A
plumb
line
Jehovah
then
said
Here
I
am
putting
a
plumb
line
among
my
people
Israel
I
will
no
longer
pardon
them
9
The
high
places
of
Isaac
will
be
desolated
and
the
sanctuaries
of
Israel
will
be
devastated
and
I
will
come
against
the
house
of
Jeroboam
with
a
sword
10
Amaziah
the
priest
of
Bethel
sent
this
message
to
King
Jeroboam
of
Israel
Amos
is
conspiring
against
you
right
in
the
midst
of
the
house
of
Israel
The
land
cannot
put
up
with
all
his
words
11
For
this
is
what
Amos
says
Jeroboam
will
die
by
the
sword
and
Israel
will
surely
go
into
exile
from
its
land
12
Amaziah
then
said
to
Amos
O
visionary
go
run
away
to
the
land
of
Judah
earn
your
bread
there
and
there
you
may
prophesy
13
But
you
must
no
longer
prophesy
at
Bethel
for
it
is
the
sanctuary
of
a
king
and
the
house
of
a
kingdom
14
Then
Amos
answered
Amaziah
I
was
not
a
prophet
nor
the
son
of
a
prophet
but
I
was
a
herdsman
and
I
took
care
of
sycamore
fig
trees
15
But
Jehovah
took
me
away
from
following
the
flock
and
Jehovah
said
to
me
Go
prophesy
to
my
people
Israel
16
So
now
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
You
are
saying
Do
not
prophesy
against
Israel
and
do
not
preach
against
the
house
of
Isaac
17
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Your
wife
will
become
a
prostitute
in
the
city
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
will
fall
by
the
sword
Your
land
will
be
apportioned
out
with
a
measuring
line
and
you
yourself
will
die
in
an
unclean
land
and
Israel
will
surely
go
into
exile
from
its
land
1
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
showed
me
Look
There
was
a
basket
of
summer
fruit
2
Then
he
said
What
do
you
see
Amos
I
replied
A
basket
of
summer
fruit
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
The
end
has
come
for
my
people
Israel
I
will
no
longer
pardon
them
3
The
songs
of
the
temple
will
turn
into
wailing
in
that
day

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
There
will
be
many
carcasses
thrown
everywhere—hush

4
Hear
this
you
who
trample
on
the
poorAnd
who
bring
the
meek
of
the
land
to
an
end
5
Who
say
When
will
the
new
moon
festival
be
over
that
we
may
sell
our
grain
And
the
Sabbath
that
we
may
offer
grain
for
sale
So
that
we
may
make
the
ephah
measure
smallerAnd
the
shekel
weight
greater
To
falsify
our
scales
of
deception
6
So
that
we
may
buy
the
needy
for
silverAnd
the
poor
for
a
pair
of
sandals
And
sell
the
worthless
part
of
the
grain

7
Jehovah
has
sworn
by
the
Pride
of
Jacob
Never
will
I
forget
all
their
deeds

8
On
this
account
the
land
will
tremble
And
every
inhabitant
in
it
will
mourn
Will
it
not
all
rise
like
the
Nile
And
surge
and
sink
down
like
the
Nile
of
Egypt

9
In
that
day

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
I
will
make
the
sun
go
down
at
high
noon
And
I
will
darken
the
land
on
a
bright
day
10
I
will
turn
your
festivals
into
mourningAnd
all
your
songs
into
dirges
I
will
put
sackcloth
on
all
hips
and
make
every
head
bald
I
will
make
it
like
the
mourning
for
an
only
son
And
the
end
of
it
like
a
bitter
day
11
Look
The
days
are
coming

declares
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
When
I
will
send
a
famine
into
the
land
Not
a
famine
for
bread
or
a
thirst
for
water
But
for
hearing
the
words
of
Jehovah
12
They
will
stagger
from
sea
to
seaAnd
from
the
north
to
the
east
They
will
rove
about
searching
for
the
word
of
Jehovah
but
they
will
not
find
it
13
In
that
day
beautiful
virgins
will
faint
Also
young
men
because
of
the
thirst
14
Those
who
swear
by
the
guilt
of
Samaria
and
who
say
As
surely
as
your
god
lives
O
Dan
And
As
surely
as
the
way
of
Beer-sheba
lives
They
will
fall
and
they
will
not
rise
up
again
1
I
saw
Jehovah
stationed
above
the
altar
and
he
said
Strike
the
head
of
the
pillar
and
the
thresholds
will
shake
Cut
them
off
at
the
head
and
I
will
kill
the
last
of
them
with
the
sword
No
one
who
flees
will
get
away
and
no
one
trying
to
escape
will
succeed

2
If
they
dig
down
into
the
Grave
From
there
my
hand
will
take
them
And
if
they
go
up
to
the
heavens
From
there
I
will
bring
them
down

3
And
if
they
hide
themselves
on
the
top
of
Carmel
From
there
I
will
search
them
out
and
take
them
If
they
conceal
themselves
from
my
eyes
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
There
I
will
command
the
serpent
to
bite
them

4
If
they
go
into
captivity
before
their
enemies
From
there
I
will
command
the
sword
and
it
will
kill
them
I
will
fix
my
eyes
on
them
for
bad
and
not
for
good

5
For
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
of
the
armies
is
the
One
who
touches
the
land
So
that
it
melts
and
all
its
inhabitants
will
mourn
And
all
of
it
will
rise
like
the
Nile
And
sink
down
like
the
Nile
of
Egypt

6
The
one
who
builds
his
stairs
in
the
heavensAnd
establishes
his
structure
over
the
earth
The
one
who
summons
the
waters
of
the
sea
To
pour
them
out
on
the
surface
of
the
earth—Jehovah
is
his
name

7
Are
you
not
like
the
sons
of
the
Cushites
to
me
O
people
of
Israel
declares
Jehovah
Did
I
not
bring
Israel
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
The
Philistines
out
of
Crete
and
Syria
out
of
Kir

8
Look
The
eyes
of
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
are
on
the
sinful
kingdom
And
he
will
annihilate
it
from
the
surface
of
the
land
But
I
will
not
completely
annihilate
the
house
of
Jacob

declares
Jehovah

9
For
look
I
am
giving
the
command
And
I
will
shake
the
house
of
Israel
among
all
the
nations
Just
as
one
shakes
a
sieve
And
not
a
pebble
falls
to
the
ground
10
They
will
die
by
the
sword
all
the
sinners
of
my
people
Those
who
are
saying
The
calamity
will
not
come
near
us
or
reach
us
11
In
that
day
I
will
raise
up
the
booth
of
David
that
is
fallen
I
will
repair
the
breaches
And
I
will
restore
its
ruins
I
will
rebuild
it
as
in
the
days
of
long
ago
12
So
that
they
may
take
possession
of
what
is
remaining
of
Edom
And
all
the
nations
on
whom
my
name
has
been
called

declares
Jehovah
who
is
doing
this
13
Look
The
days
are
coming

declares
Jehovah
When
the
plowman
will
overtake
the
harvester
And
the
treader
of
grapes
the
one
carrying
seed
And
the
mountains
will
drip
with
sweet
wine
And
all
the
hills
will
flow
with
it
14
I
will
gather
back
the
captives
of
my
people
Israel
And
they
will
rebuild
the
desolated
cities
and
inhabit
them
They
will
plant
vineyards
and
drink
their
wine
And
make
gardens
and
eat
their
fruit
15
I
will
plant
them
on
their
land
And
they
will
never
again
be
uprootedFrom
their
land
that
I
have
given
them

says
Jehovah
your
God
1
The
vision
of
Obadiah
This
is
what
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
says
regarding
Edom
We
have
heard
a
report
from
Jehovah
An
envoy
has
been
sent
among
the
nations
Rise
up
let
us
prepare
for
battle
against
her

2
Look
I
have
made
you
insignificant
among
the
nations
You
are
utterly
despised

3
The
presumptuousness
of
your
heart
has
deceived
you
You
who
reside
in
the
retreats
of
the
crag
Dwelling
in
the
height
saying
in
your
heart
Who
will
bring
me
down
to
the
earth

4
Even
if
you
make
your
dwelling
high
like
the
eagle
Or
if
you
place
your
nest
among
the
stars
I
would
bring
you
down
from
there

declares
Jehovah

5
If
thieves
would
come
to
you
robbers
by
night
How
utterly
you
will
be
destroyed
Would
they
not
steal
only
what
they
wanted
Or
if
it
were
grape
gatherers
who
would
come
to
you
Would
they
not
leave
some
gleanings
behind

6
O
how
Esau
has
been
searched
out
How
his
hidden
treasures
have
been
sought
after

7
They
have
driven
you
to
the
border
All
your
allies
have
deceived
you
The
men
at
peace
with
you
have
prevailed
against
you
Those
eating
bread
with
you
will
place
a
net
under
you
But
you
will
not
discern
it

8
In
that
day

declares
Jehovah
Will
I
not
destroy
the
wise
ones
out
of
EdomAnd
discernment
out
of
the
mountainous
region
of
Esau

9
And
your
warriors
will
become
terrified
O
Teman
Because
each
one
in
the
mountainous
region
of
Esau
will
be
destroyed
in
the
slaughter
10
Because
of
the
violence
done
to
your
brother
Jacob
Shame
will
cover
you
And
you
will
perish
forever
11
On
the
day
when
you
stood
off
to
the
side
On
the
day
when
strangers
took
his
army
into
captivity
When
foreigners
entered
his
gate
and
cast
lots
over
Jerusalem
You
acted
like
one
of
them
12
You
should
not
gloat
over
your
brothers
day
on
the
day
of
his
misfortune
You
should
not
rejoice
over
the
people
of
Judah
on
the
day
of
their
perishing
And
you
should
not
speak
so
arrogantly
on
the
day
of
their
distress
13
You
should
not
come
into
the
gate
of
my
people
in
the
day
of
their
disaster
You
should
not
gloat
over
his
calamity
in
the
day
of
his
disaster
And
you
should
not
lay
your
hands
on
his
wealth
in
the
day
of
his
disaster
14
You
should
not
stand
at
the
crossroads
to
slaughter
his
escapees
And
you
should
not
hand
over
his
survivors
in
the
day
of
distress
15
For
the
day
of
Jehovah
against
all
the
nations
is
near
As
you
have
done
so
it
will
be
done
to
you
The
way
you
treated
others
will
come
back
on
your
own
head
16
For
in
the
way
that
you
have
drunk
on
my
holy
mountain
All
the
nations
will
keep
drinking
constantly
They
will
drink
and
gulp
down
And
they
will
be
as
though
they
had
never
existed
17
But
on
Mount
Zion
will
be
those
who
escape
And
it
will
be
holy
And
the
house
of
Jacob
will
take
possession
of
the
things
belonging
to
them
18
The
house
of
Jacob
will
become
a
fire
The
house
of
Joseph
a
flame
And
the
house
of
Esau
like
stubble
They
will
set
them
ablaze
and
consume
them
And
there
will
be
no
survivor
of
the
house
of
Esau
For
Jehovah
himself
has
spoken
19
They
will
take
possession
of
the
Negeb
and
the
mountainous
region
of
Esau
Of
the
Shephelah
and
the
land
of
the
Philistines
They
will
take
possession
of
the
field
of
Ephraim
and
the
field
of
Samaria
And
Benjamin
will
take
possession
of
Gilead
20
To
the
exiles
of
this
rampart
To
the
people
of
Israel
will
belong
the
land
of
the
Canaanites
as
far
as
Zarephath
And
the
exiles
of
Jerusalem
who
were
in
Sepharad
will
possess
the
cities
of
the
Negeb
21
And
saviors
will
go
up
on
Mount
ZionTo
judge
the
mountainous
region
of
Esau
And
the
kingship
will
become
Jehovahs
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jonah
the
son
of
Amittai
saying
2
Get
up
go
to
Nineveh
the
great
city
and
proclaim
judgment
against
her
for
their
wickedness
has
come
to
my
attention
3
But
Jonah
got
up
to
run
away
from
Jehovah
to
Tarshish
he
went
down
to
Joppa
and
found
a
ship
going
to
Tarshish
So
he
paid
the
fare
and
went
aboard
to
go
with
them
to
Tarshish
away
from
Jehovah
4
Then
Jehovah
hurled
a
strong
wind
at
the
sea
and
there
was
such
a
violent
storm
on
the
sea
that
the
ship
was
about
to
be
wrecked
5
The
mariners
were
so
frightened
that
each
of
them
began
to
call
on
his
god
for
help
And
they
began
throwing
the
articles
of
the
ship
into
the
sea
to
make
it
lighter
But
Jonah
had
gone
down
into
the
inner
part
of
the
ship
where
he
lay
down
and
fell
fast
asleep
6
The
ship
captain
approached
and
said
to
him
Why
are
you
sleeping
Get
up
call
out
to
your
god
Perhaps
the
true
God
will
show
his
concern
for
us
and
we
will
not
perish
7
Then
they
said
to
one
another
Come
let
us
cast
lots
to
find
out
who
is
to
blame
for
this
calamity
So
they
cast
lots
and
the
lot
fell
to
Jonah
8
They
said
to
him
Please
tell
us
who
is
to
blame
for
this
calamity
that
has
come
upon
us
What
is
your
work
and
where
do
you
come
from
What
is
your
country
and
from
what
people
are
you
9
He
replied
I
am
a
Hebrew
and
I
fear
Jehovah
the
God
of
the
heavens
the
One
who
made
the
sea
and
the
dry
land
10
At
this
the
men
became
even
more
afraid
and
they
asked
him
What
have
you
done
The
men
learned
that
he
was
running
away
from
Jehovah
because
he
had
told
them
11
So
they
said
to
him
What
should
we
do
to
you
to
make
the
sea
calm
down
for
us
For
the
sea
was
growing
more
and
more
stormy
12
He
replied
Lift
me
up
and
throw
me
into
the
sea
and
the
sea
will
calm
down
for
you
for
I
know
that
it
is
because
of
me
that
this
violent
storm
has
come
upon
you
13
However
the
men
rowed
hard
to
bring
the
ship
back
to
dry
land
but
they
could
not
because
the
sea
grew
more
and
more
stormy
around
them
14
Then
they
called
out
to
Jehovah
and
said
Ah
now
O
Jehovah
please
may
we
not
perish
because
of
this
man
Do
not
hold
us
responsible
for
innocent
blood
since
you
have
done
as
you
pleased
O
Jehovah
15
Then
they
lifted
Jonah
up
and
threw
him
into
the
sea
and
the
sea
ceased
its
raging
16
Then
the
men
were
struck
with
great
fear
of
Jehovah
and
they
offered
a
sacrifice
to
Jehovah
and
made
vows
17
Jehovah
now
sent
a
huge
fish
to
swallow
Jonah
so
that
Jonah
came
to
be
in
the
belly
of
the
fish
for
three
days
and
three
nights
1
Then
Jonah
prayed
to
Jehovah
his
God
from
the
belly
of
the
fish
2
and
he
said
Out
of
my
distress
I
called
out
to
Jehovah
and
he
answered
me
Out
of
the
depths
of
the
Grave
I
cried
for
help
You
heard
my
voice

3
When
you
threw
me
to
the
depths
into
the
heart
of
the
open
sea
Then
the
currents
engulfed
me
All
your
breakers
and
waves
swept
over
me

4
And
I
said
I
have
been
driven
away
from
your
sight
How
will
I
gaze
again
upon
your
holy
temple

5
Waters
engulfed
me
and
threatened
my
life
The
watery
deep
closed
in
on
me
Weeds
were
wrapped
around
my
head

6
To
the
bottoms
of
the
mountains
I
sank
down
The
bars
of
the
earth
were
closing
upon
me
forever
But
out
of
the
pit
you
brought
up
my
life
O
Jehovah
my
God

7
When
my
life
was
ebbing
away
Jehovah
was
the
One
whom
I
remembered
Then
my
prayer
came
in
to
you
into
your
holy
temple

8
Those
who
are
devoted
to
the
worthless
idols
forsake
their
source
of
loyal
love

9
But
as
for
me
with
the
voice
of
thanksgiving
I
will
sacrifice
to
you
What
I
have
vowed
I
will
pay
Salvation
is
from
Jehovah
10
In
time
Jehovah
commanded
the
fish
and
it
vomited
Jonah
out
onto
the
dry
land
1
Then
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Jonah
a
second
time
saying
2
Get
up
go
to
Nineveh
the
great
city
and
proclaim
to
her
the
message
that
I
tell
you
3
So
Jonah
got
up
and
went
to
Nineveh
in
obedience
to
the
word
of
Jehovah
Now
Nineveh
was
a
very
large
city—a
walking
distance
of
three
days
4
Then
Jonah
entered
the
city
and
walking
a
days
journey
he
was
proclaiming
In
just
40
days
more
Nineveh
will
be
overthrown
5
And
the
men
of
Nineveh
put
faith
in
God
and
they
proclaimed
a
fast
and
put
on
sackcloth
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
of
them
6
When
the
message
reached
the
king
of
Nineveh
he
rose
up
from
his
throne
and
took
off
his
royal
garment
and
covered
himself
with
sackcloth
and
sat
down
in
the
ashes
7
Furthermore
he
issued
a
proclamation
throughout
Nineveh
By
the
decree
of
the
king
and
his
nobles
No
man
or
beast
herd
or
flock
should
eat
anything
at
all
They
should
not
take
food
nor
should
they
drink
any
water
8
Let
them
be
covered
with
sackcloth
both
man
and
beast
and
let
them
call
out
earnestly
to
God
and
turn
from
their
evil
ways
and
from
the
violence
they
practice
9
Who
knows
whether
the
true
God
may
reconsider
what
he
intends
to
do
and
turn
from
his
burning
anger
so
that
we
may
not
perish
10
When
the
true
God
saw
what
they
did
how
they
had
turned
back
from
their
evil
ways
he
reconsidered
the
calamity
that
he
said
he
would
bring
on
them
and
he
did
not
bring
it
1
But
this
was
highly
displeasing
to
Jonah
and
he
became
hot
with
anger
2
So
he
prayed
to
Jehovah
Ah
now
Jehovah
was
this
not
my
concern
when
I
was
in
my
own
land
That
is
why
I
tried
to
flee
to
Tarshish
in
the
first
place
for
I
knew
that
you
are
a
compassionate
and
merciful
God
slow
to
anger
and
abundant
in
loyal
love
one
who
feels
grieved
over
calamity
3
Now
O
Jehovah
please
take
away
my
life
for
it
is
better
for
me
to
die
than
to
live
4
Jehovah
asked
Is
it
right
for
you
to
be
so
angry
5
Jonah
then
went
out
of
the
city
and
sat
down
east
of
the
city
He
made
a
shelter
for
himself
there
and
sat
in
its
shade
to
see
what
would
happen
to
the
city
6
Jehovah
God
then
provided
a
bottle-gourd
plant
to
grow
up
over
Jonah
to
give
him
shade
for
his
head
and
to
relieve
his
misery
And
Jonah
was
very
pleased
with
the
bottle-gourd
plant
7
But
the
true
God
sent
a
worm
at
the
break
of
dawn
on
the
next
day
and
it
attacked
the
bottle-gourd
plant
and
it
withered
8
When
the
sun
began
to
shine
God
also
sent
a
scorching
east
wind
and
the
sun
beat
down
on
Jonahs
head
and
he
grew
faint
He
kept
asking
to
die
and
he
kept
saying
It
is
better
for
me
to
die
than
to
live
9
God
asked
Jonah
Is
it
right
for
you
to
be
so
angry
over
the
bottle-gourd
plant
At
that
he
said
I
have
a
right
to
be
angry
so
angry
that
I
want
to
die
10
But
Jehovah
said
You
felt
sorry
for
the
bottle-gourd
plant
which
you
did
not
work
for
nor
did
you
make
it
grow
it
grew
in
one
night
and
perished
in
one
night
11
Should
I
not
also
feel
sorry
for
Nineveh
the
great
city
in
which
there
are
more
than
120000
men
who
do
not
even
know
right
from
wrong
as
well
as
their
many
animals
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
that
came
to
Micah
of
Moresheth
in
the
days
of
Jotham
Ahaz
and
Hezekiah
kings
of
Judah
and
that
he
received
in
a
vision
concerning
Samaria
and
Jerusalem

2
Hear
all
you
peoples
Pay
attention
O
earth
and
what
fills
you
And
let
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
serve
as
a
witness
against
you—Jehovah
from
his
holy
temple

3
For
look
Jehovah
is
going
out
from
his
place
He
will
come
down
and
tread
on
earths
high
places

4
The
mountains
will
melt
under
him
And
the
valleys
will
split
apartLike
wax
before
the
fire
Like
waters
poured
down
a
steep
slope

5
All
of
this
is
because
of
the
revolt
of
Jacob
Because
of
the
sins
of
the
house
of
Israel
What
is
the
revolt
of
Jacob
Is
it
not
Samaria
And
what
are
the
high
places
of
Judah
Are
they
not
Jerusalem

6
I
will
make
Samaria
a
heap
of
ruins
of
the
field
A
place
for
planting
vineyards
I
will
hurl
her
stones
down
into
the
valley
And
I
will
lay
bare
her
foundations

7
All
her
graven
images
will
be
crushed
to
pieces
And
all
the
gifts
for
which
she
hired
herself
out
will
be
burned
in
the
fire
I
will
devastate
all
her
idols
For
she
collected
them
from
the
wages
of
prostitution
And
they
will
again
become
the
wages
of
prostitutes

8
Because
of
this
I
will
wail
and
howl
I
will
walk
barefoot
and
naked
My
wailing
will
be
like
that
of
jackals
And
my
mourning
like
that
of
ostriches

9
For
her
wound
cannot
be
healed
It
has
come
as
far
as
Judah
The
plague
has
spread
to
the
gate
of
my
people
to
Jerusalem
10
Do
not
announce
it
in
Gath
You
must
not
weep
at
all
In
Beth-aphrah
roll
in
the
dust
11
Cross
over
in
nakedness
and
shame
O
inhabitants
of
Shaphir
The
inhabitants
of
Zaanan
have
not
come
out
There
will
be
wailing
in
Beth-ezel
and
it
will
take
its
support
away
from
you
12
For
the
inhabitants
of
Maroth
have
waited
for
good
But
what
is
bad
has
come
down
from
Jehovah
to
the
gate
of
Jerusalem
13
Harness
the
chariot
to
the
team
of
horses
O
inhabitants
of
Lachish
You
were
the
beginning
of
sin
to
the
daughter
of
Zion
For
in
you
were
found
the
revolts
of
Israel
14
So
you
will
give
parting
gifts
to
Moresheth-gath
The
houses
of
Achzib
were
something
deceitful
to
the
kings
of
Israel
15
The
conqueror
I
will
yet
bring
in
to
you
O
inhabitants
of
Mareshah
As
far
as
Adullam
the
glory
of
Israel
will
come
16
Make
yourselves
bald
and
shear
off
your
hair
for
your
cherished
children
Make
yourselves
as
bald
as
an
eagle
For
they
have
been
taken
away
from
you
into
exile
1
Woe
to
those
who
scheme
what
is
harmful
Who
work
out
evil
on
their
beds
When
morning
light
comes
they
carry
it
out
Because
it
is
in
the
power
of
their
hand

2
They
desire
fields
and
seize
them
Also
houses
and
they
take
them
They
defraud
a
man
of
his
house
A
man
of
his
inheritance

3
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
Here
I
am
devising
against
this
family
a
calamity
from
which
you
will
not
escape
You
will
no
longer
walk
haughtily
for
it
is
a
time
of
calamity

4
In
that
day
people
will
recite
a
proverb
concerning
you
And
they
will
bitterly
lament
over
you
They
will
say
We
are
completely
devastated
He
caused
the
portion
of
my
people
to
change
hands—how
he
removes
it
from
me
To
the
unfaithful
one
he
assigns
our
fields

5
So
you
will
have
no
one
to
stretch
the
measuring
cord
To
allot
the
land
in
the
congregation
of
Jehovah

6
Stop
preaching
they
preach
They
should
not
preach
these
things
Humiliation
will
not
overtake
us

7
Is
it
being
said
O
house
of
Jacob
Has
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
become
impatient
Are
these
his
deeds
Do
not
my
own
words
bring
good
to
those
walking
uprightly

8
But
lately
my
own
people
have
risen
up
as
an
enemy
You
openly
strip
off
the
majestic
ornament
with
the
garmentFrom
those
passing
by
confidently
like
those
returning
from
war

9
You
drive
the
women
of
my
people
out
from
their
delightful
houses
From
their
children
you
take
away
my
splendor
forever
10
Get
up
and
go
for
this
is
no
place
of
rest
Because
of
uncleanness
there
is
destruction
grievous
destruction
11
If
a
man
walks
after
wind
and
deception
and
tells
this
lie
I
will
preach
to
you
about
wine
and
alcoholic
drink

Then
he
would
be
just
the
preacher
for
this
people
12
I
will
certainly
gather
all
of
you
O
Jacob
I
will
surely
collect
the
remaining
ones
of
Israel
together
In
unity
I
will
place
them
like
sheep
in
the
pen
Like
a
flock
in
its
pasture
It
will
be
noisy
with
people
13
The
one
breaking
out
will
go
before
them
They
will
break
out
and
pass
through
the
gate
and
go
out
by
it
Their
king
will
pass
through
before
them
With
Jehovah
at
their
head
1
I
said
Hear
please
you
heads
of
JacobAnd
you
commanders
of
the
house
of
Israel
Should
you
not
know
what
is
just

2
But
you
hate
what
is
good
and
love
what
is
bad
You
tear
off
the
skin
from
my
people
and
the
flesh
from
their
bones

3
You
also
eat
the
flesh
of
my
peopleAnd
strip
off
their
skin
Smashing
their
bones
crushing
them
to
pieces
Like
what
is
cooked
in
a
pot
like
meat
in
a
cooking
pot

4
At
that
time
they
will
call
to
Jehovah
for
help
But
he
will
not
answer
them
He
will
hide
his
face
from
them
at
that
time
Because
of
their
wicked
deeds

5
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
against
the
prophets
who
are
leading
my
people
astray
Who
proclaim
Peace
while
they
bite
with
their
teethBut
who
declare
war
against
him
who
puts
nothing
into
their
mouths

6
You
will
have
night
there
will
be
no
vision
There
will
only
be
darkness
for
you
no
divination
The
sun
will
set
on
the
prophets
And
the
day
will
turn
dark
for
them

7
The
visionaries
will
be
put
to
shame
And
the
diviners
will
be
disappointed
All
of
them
will
have
to
cover
over
the
mustache
For
there
is
no
answer
from
God

8
As
for
me
I
am
filled
with
power
by
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
And
with
justice
and
might
To
tell
to
Jacob
his
revolt
and
to
Israel
his
sin

9
Hear
this
please
you
heads
of
the
house
of
JacobAnd
you
commanders
of
the
house
of
Israel
Who
detest
justice
and
who
make
crooked
all
that
is
straight
10
Who
build
Zion
with
bloodshed
and
Jerusalem
with
unrighteousness
11
Her
leaders
judge
for
a
bribe
Her
priests
instruct
for
a
price
And
her
prophets
practice
divination
for
money
And
yet
they
lean
on
Jehovah
saying
Is
not
Jehovah
with
us
No
calamity
will
come
upon
us
12
So
because
of
you
Zion
will
be
plowed
up
as
a
field
Jerusalem
will
become
heaps
of
ruins
And
the
mountain
of
the
House
will
become
like
high
places
in
a
forest
1
In
the
final
part
of
the
days
The
mountain
of
the
house
of
JehovahWill
become
firmly
established
above
the
top
of
the
mountains
And
it
will
be
raised
up
above
the
hills
And
to
it
peoples
will
stream

2
And
many
nations
will
go
and
say
Come
let
us
go
up
to
the
mountain
of
JehovahAnd
to
the
house
of
the
God
of
Jacob
He
will
instruct
us
about
his
ways
And
we
will
walk
in
his
paths
For
law
will
go
out
of
Zion
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
out
of
Jerusalem

3
He
will
render
judgment
among
many
peoplesAnd
set
matters
straight
respecting
mighty
nations
far
away
They
will
beat
their
swords
into
plowsharesAnd
their
spears
into
pruning
shears
Nation
will
not
lift
up
sword
against
nation
Nor
will
they
learn
war
anymore

4
They
will
sit
each
one
under
his
vine
and
under
his
fig
tree
And
no
one
will
make
them
afraid
For
the
mouth
of
Jehovah
of
armies
has
spoken

5
For
all
the
peoples
will
walk
each
in
the
name
of
its
god
But
we
will
walk
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
our
God
forever
and
ever

6
In
that
day

declares
Jehovah
I
will
gather
the
one
who
was
limping
And
collect
together
the
dispersed
one
Along
with
those
I
treated
harshly

7
I
will
make
the
one
who
was
limping
a
remnant
And
the
one
far
removed
a
mighty
nation
And
Jehovah
will
rule
as
king
over
them
in
Mount
Zion
From
now
on
and
forever

8
As
for
you
O
tower
of
the
flock
The
mound
of
the
daughter
of
Zion
To
you
it
will
come
yes
the
first
dominion
will
come
The
kingdom
belonging
to
the
daughter
of
Jerusalem

9
Now
why
are
you
shouting
loudly
Have
you
no
king
Or
has
your
adviser
perished
So
that
pain
has
seized
you
like
a
woman
giving
birth
10
Writhe
and
groan
O
daughter
of
Zion
Like
a
woman
giving
birth
For
now
you
will
go
from
the
city
and
reside
in
the
field
You
will
go
as
far
as
to
Babylon
And
there
you
will
be
rescued
There
Jehovah
will
buy
you
back
from
the
hand
of
your
enemies
11
Now
many
nations
will
be
gathered
against
you
They
will
say
Let
her
be
defiled
And
let
our
eyes
see
this
happen
to
Zion
12
But
they
do
not
know
the
thoughts
of
Jehovah
They
do
not
understand
his
purpose
For
he
will
gather
them
like
a
row
of
newly
cut
grain
to
the
threshing
floor
13
Get
up
and
thresh
O
daughter
of
Zion
For
I
will
change
your
horns
into
iron
And
I
will
change
your
hooves
into
copper
And
you
will
pulverize
many
peoples
You
will
devote
their
dishonest
profit
to
Jehovah
And
their
resources
to
the
true
Lord
of
the
whole
earth
1
Now
you
are
slashing
yourself
O
daughter
under
attack
A
siege
is
laid
against
us
With
a
rod
they
strike
the
judge
of
Israel
on
the
cheek

2
And
you
O
Bethlehem
Ephrathah
The
one
too
little
to
be
among
the
thousands
of
Judah
From
you
will
come
out
for
me
the
one
to
be
ruler
in
Israel
Whose
origin
is
from
ancient
times
from
the
days
of
long
ago

3
So
he
will
give
them
upUntil
the
time
that
she
who
is
to
give
birth
has
given
birth
And
the
rest
of
his
brothers
will
return
to
the
people
of
Israel

4
He
will
stand
up
and
shepherd
in
the
strength
of
Jehovah
In
the
superiority
of
the
name
of
Jehovah
his
God
And
they
will
dwell
in
security
For
now
his
greatness
will
reach
the
ends
of
the
earth

5
And
he
will
bring
peace
Should
the
Assyrian
invade
our
land
and
tread
on
our
fortified
towers
We
will
raise
up
against
him
seven
shepherds
yes
eight
princes
of
mankind

6
They
will
shepherd
the
land
of
Assyria
with
the
sword
And
the
land
of
Nimrod
at
its
entrances
And
he
will
rescue
us
from
the
Assyrian
When
he
invades
our
land
and
treads
on
our
territory

7
The
remaining
ones
of
Jacob
will
be
in
the
midst
of
many
peoplesLike
dew
from
Jehovah
Like
showers
of
rain
on
vegetationThat
do
not
put
hope
in
manOr
wait
for
the
sons
of
men

8
The
remaining
ones
of
Jacob
will
be
among
the
nations
In
the
midst
of
many
peoples
Like
a
lion
among
the
beasts
of
a
forest
Like
a
young
lion
among
flocks
of
sheep
That
passes
through
and
pounces
and
tears
in
pieces
And
there
is
no
one
to
rescue
them

9
Your
hand
will
be
raised
over
your
adversaries
And
all
your
enemies
will
be
destroyed
10
In
that
day

declares
Jehovah
I
will
do
away
with
your
horses
from
your
midst
and
destroy
your
chariots
11
I
will
destroy
the
cities
of
your
landAnd
tear
down
all
your
fortified
places
12
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
sorcery
you
practice
And
no
one
practicing
magic
will
remain
among
you
13
I
will
destroy
your
graven
images
and
your
pillars
from
your
midst
And
you
will
no
longer
bow
down
to
the
work
of
your
hands
14
I
will
uproot
your
sacred
poles
from
your
midstAnd
annihilate
your
cities
15
In
anger
and
wrath
I
will
execute
vengeanceOn
the
nations
that
have
not
obeyed
1
Hear
please
what
Jehovah
is
saying
Get
up
present
a
legal
case
before
the
mountains
And
may
the
hills
hear
your
voice

2
Hear
O
mountains
the
legal
case
of
Jehovah
You
firm
foundations
of
the
earth
For
Jehovah
has
a
legal
case
with
his
people
It
is
against
Israel
that
he
will
argue

3
My
people
what
have
I
done
to
you
How
have
I
tired
you
out
Testify
against
me

4
For
I
brought
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
From
the
house
of
slavery
I
redeemed
you
I
sent
before
you
Moses
Aaron
and
Miriam

5
My
people
remember
please
what
King
Balak
of
Moab
proposed
And
what
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
answered
him—What
took
place
from
Shittim
to
Gilgal—So
that
you
may
know
the
righteous
acts
of
Jehovah

6
With
what
will
I
come
before
Jehovah
With
what
will
I
bow
before
God
on
high
Will
I
come
before
him
with
whole
burnt
offerings
With
year-old
calves

7
Will
Jehovah
be
pleased
with
thousands
of
rams
With
tens
of
thousands
of
torrents
of
oil
Will
I
give
my
firstborn
son
for
my
revolt
The
fruit
of
my
body
for
my
sin

8
He
has
told
you
O
man
what
is
good
And
what
is
Jehovah
requiring
of
you
Only
to
exercise
justice
to
cherish
loyalty
And
to
walk
in
modesty
with
your
God

9
The
voice
of
Jehovah
calls
out
to
the
city
Those
with
practical
wisdom
will
fear
your
name
Pay
attention
to
the
rod
and
to
the
one
who
appointed
it
10
Are
there
still
the
treasures
of
wickedness
in
the
house
of
the
wickedAnd
the
incomplete
ephah
measure
that
is
detestable
11
Can
I
be
morally
clean
with
wicked
scales
With
a
bag
of
fraudulent
stone
weights
12
For
her
rich
men
are
full
of
violence
And
her
inhabitants
speak
lies
Their
tongue
is
deceitful
in
their
mouth
13
Therefore
I
will
wound
you
by
striking
you
Making
you
desolate
because
of
your
sins
14
You
will
eat
but
not
be
satisfied
You
will
be
empty
inside
What
you
remove
you
will
not
carry
off
safely
And
what
you
do
carry
off
I
will
give
to
the
sword
15
You
will
sow
seed
but
you
will
not
reap
You
will
tread
olives
but
you
will
not
use
the
oil
And
you
will
make
new
wine
but
you
will
drink
no
wine
16
For
you
observe
the
statutes
of
Omri
and
all
the
work
of
the
house
of
Ahab
And
you
walk
in
accord
with
their
advice
That
is
why
I
will
make
you
an
object
of
horrorAnd
her
inhabitants
something
to
be
whistled
at
And
you
will
bear
the
scorn
of
the
peoples
1
Woe
to
me
I
am
like
one
who
After
the
gathering
of
summer
fruitAnd
the
gleaning
following
a
grape
harvest
Finds
no
cluster
of
grapes
to
eat
No
early
fig
that
I
crave

2
The
loyal
one
has
perished
from
the
earth
Among
men
there
is
no
one
upright
All
of
them
lie
in
ambush
for
bloodshed
Each
hunts
his
own
brother
with
a
dragnet

3
Their
hands
are
expert
at
doing
what
is
bad
The
prince
is
making
demands
The
judge
asks
for
a
reward
The
prominent
one
makes
known
his
desires
And
they
work
it
out
together

4
Their
best
one
is
like
thorns
Their
most
upright
one
is
worse
than
a
thorn
hedge
The
day
of
your
watchmen
and
of
your
reckoning
will
come
Now
they
will
panic

5
Do
not
put
faith
in
your
companionOr
trust
a
close
friend
Guard
what
you
say
to
the
one
who
lies
in
your
embrace

6
For
a
son
despises
his
father
A
daughter
rises
up
against
her
mother
And
a
daughter-in-law
is
against
her
mother-in-law
A
mans
enemies
are
the
men
of
his
household

7
But
as
for
me
I
will
keep
on
the
lookout
for
Jehovah
I
will
show
a
waiting
attitude
for
the
God
of
my
salvation
My
God
will
hear
me

8
Do
not
rejoice
over
me
O
my
enemy
Although
I
have
fallen
I
will
rise
up
Although
I
dwell
in
the
darkness
Jehovah
will
be
my
light

9
The
wrath
of
Jehovah
I
will
bear—For
I
have
sinned
against
him—Until
he
pleads
my
legal
case
and
brings
about
justice
for
me
He
will
bring
me
out
to
the
light
I
will
look
upon
his
righteousness
10
My
enemy
will
also
see
And
shame
will
cover
her
who
said
to
me
Where
is
Jehovah
your
God
My
eyes
will
look
upon
her
Now
she
will
be
trampled
like
mud
in
the
streets
11
It
will
be
a
day
for
building
your
stone
walls
On
that
day
the
boundary
will
be
extended
12
On
that
day
they
will
come
to
youAll
the
way
from
Assyria
and
the
cities
of
Egypt
From
Egypt
all
the
way
to
the
River
From
sea
to
sea
and
from
mountain
to
mountain
13
And
the
land
will
become
desolate
because
of
its
inhabitants
As
a
result
of
what
they
have
done
14
Shepherd
your
people
with
your
staff
the
flock
of
your
inheritance
The
one
who
was
living
alone
in
a
forest—in
the
midst
of
an
orchard
Let
them
feed
on
Bashan
and
Gilead
as
in
the
days
of
old
15
As
in
the
days
when
you
came
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
I
will
show
him
wonderful
things
16
Nations
will
see
and
be
ashamed
despite
all
their
might
They
will
put
their
hand
over
their
mouth
Their
ears
will
become
deaf
17
They
will
lick
the
dust
like
serpents
Like
the
reptiles
of
the
earth
they
will
come
trembling
out
of
their
strongholds
To
Jehovah
our
God
they
will
come
in
dread
And
they
will
be
in
fear
of
you
18
Who
is
a
God
like
you
Pardoning
error
and
passing
over
the
transgression
of
the
remnant
of
his
inheritance
He
will
not
hold
onto
his
anger
forever
For
he
delights
in
loyal
love
19
He
will
again
show
us
mercy
he
will
conquer
our
errors
You
will
throw
all
their
sins
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
20
You
will
show
faithfulness
to
Jacob
Loyal
love
to
Abraham
As
you
swore
to
our
forefathers
from
the
days
of
old
1
A
pronouncement
against
Nineveh
The
book
of
the
vision
of
Nahum
the
Elkoshite

2
Jehovah
is
a
God
who
requires
exclusive
devotion
and
takes
vengeance
Jehovah
takes
vengeance
and
is
ready
to
express
his
wrath
Jehovah
takes
vengeance
against
his
foes
And
he
stores
up
wrath
for
his
enemies

3
Jehovah
is
slow
to
anger
and
great
in
power
But
by
no
means
will
Jehovah
hold
back
due
punishment
His
path
is
in
destructive
wind
and
storm
And
the
clouds
are
the
dust
of
his
feet

4
He
rebukes
the
sea
and
he
dries
it
up
And
he
makes
all
the
rivers
run
dry
Bashan
and
Carmel
wither
And
the
blossoms
of
Lebanon
wither

5
Mountains
quake
because
of
him
And
the
hills
melt
The
earth
will
be
in
an
upheaval
because
of
his
face
Along
with
the
land
and
all
those
dwelling
in
it

6
Who
can
stand
before
his
indignation
And
who
can
withstand
the
heat
of
his
anger
His
wrath
will
be
poured
out
like
fire
And
the
rocks
will
be
shattered
because
of
him

7
Jehovah
is
good
a
stronghold
in
the
day
of
distress
He
is
mindful
of
those
seeking
refuge
in
him

8
With
a
sweeping
flood
he
will
make
a
complete
extermination
of
her
place
And
darkness
will
pursue
his
enemies

9
What
will
you
plot
against
Jehovah
He
is
causing
a
complete
extermination
Distress
will
not
arise
a
second
time
10
For
they
are
interwoven
like
thorns
And
they
are
like
those
drunk
with
beer
But
they
will
be
consumed
like
dry
stubble
11
From
you
will
come
one
who
plots
evil
against
Jehovah
Giving
worthless
advice
12
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
Though
they
were
at
full
strength
and
numerous
Even
so
they
will
be
cut
down
and
will
pass
away
I
have
afflicted
you
but
I
will
afflict
you
no
more
13
And
now
I
will
break
his
yoke
bar
from
off
you
And
I
will
tear
your
bonds
in
two
14
Jehovah
has
commanded
concerning
you
Your
name
will
not
be
perpetuated
further
I
will
do
away
with
the
carved
images
and
metal
statues
from
the
house
of
your
gods
I
will
make
a
grave
for
you
because
you
are
contemptible
15
Look
On
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
one
bringing
good
news
The
one
proclaiming
peace
Celebrate
your
festivals
O
Judah
pay
your
vows
For
the
worthless
one
will
never
pass
through
you
again
He
will
be
utterly
destroyed
1
One
who
scatters
has
come
up
against
you
Guard
the
fortifications
Keep
watch
over
the
road
Brace
yourselves
and
muster
all
your
strength

2
For
Jehovah
will
restore
the
pride
of
Jacob
Along
with
the
pride
of
Israel
For
the
devastators
have
devastated
them
And
they
have
ruined
their
shoots

3
The
shields
of
his
mighty
men
are
dyed
red
His
warriors
are
dressed
in
crimson
The
iron
fittings
of
his
war
chariots
flash
like
fireIn
the
day
he
prepares
for
battle
And
the
juniper
spears
are
brandished

4
The
war
chariots
race
madly
through
the
streets
They
rush
up
and
down
the
public
squares
They
shine
like
burning
torches
and
flash
like
lightning

5
He
will
summon
his
officers
They
will
stumble
as
they
advance
They
rush
to
her
wall
They
set
up
the
barricade

6
The
gates
of
the
rivers
will
be
opened
And
the
palace
will
be
dissolved

7
It
has
been
decreed
She
is
exposed
She
is
carried
away
and
her
slave
girls
moan
They
sound
like
doves
as
they
beat
their
breasts

8
Throughout
her
days
Nineveh
was
like
a
pool
of
waters
But
now
they
are
fleeing
Stand
still
Stand
still
But
no
one
is
turning
back

9
Plunder
silver
plunder
gold
There
is
no
end
to
the
treasures
It
is
stocked
with
all
sorts
of
precious
things
10
The
city
is
empty
desolate
devastated
Their
hearts
melt
in
fear
their
knees
buckle
their
hips
tremble
All
their
faces
are
flushed
11
Where
is
the
lair
of
lions
where
the
young
lions
feed
Where
the
lion
goes
out
leading
its
cub
With
no
one
to
make
them
afraid
12
The
lion
tore
apart
enough
prey
for
his
cubsAnd
strangled
for
his
lionesses
He
kept
his
dens
filled
with
prey
His
lairs
with
torn
animals
13
Look
I
am
against
you

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
I
will
burn
up
her
war
chariots
in
smoke
And
the
sword
will
devour
your
young
lions
I
will
cut
off
your
prey
from
the
earth
And
the
sound
of
your
messengers
will
be
heard
no
more
1
Woe
to
the
city
of
bloodshed
She
is
completely
full
of
deception
and
robbery
She
is
never
without
prey

2
There
is
the
crack
of
the
whip
and
the
rattle
of
wheels
The
dashing
horse
and
the
bounding
chariot

3
The
mounted
horseman
the
flashing
sword
and
the
glittering
spear
The
multitude
of
the
slain
and
the
heaps
of
carcasses—There
is
no
end
to
the
dead
bodies
They
keep
stumbling
over
the
dead
bodies

4
This
is
because
of
the
many
acts
of
prostitution
of
the
prostitute
She
who
is
attractive
and
charming
a
mistress
of
sorceries
Who
ensnares
nations
by
her
prostitution
and
families
by
her
sorceries

5
Look
I
am
against
you

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
I
will
lift
your
skirts
up
over
your
face
I
will
cause
nations
to
see
your
nakedness
And
kingdoms
your
disgrace

6
And
I
will
throw
filth
on
youAnd
make
you
despicable
I
will
make
a
spectacle
of
you

7
Everyone
who
sees
you
will
flee
from
you
and
say
Nineveh
has
been
devastated
Who
will
sympathize
with
her
Where
will
I
find
comforters
for
you

8
Are
you
better
than
No-amon
which
sat
by
the
Nile
canals
Waters
surrounded
her
Her
wealth
was
the
sea
and
her
wall
was
the
sea

9
Ethiopia
was
her
source
of
boundless
strength
also
Egypt
Put
and
the
Libyans
were
your
helpers
10
But
even
she
became
an
exile
She
went
into
captivity
Her
children
also
were
dashed
to
pieces
on
every
street
corner
They
cast
lots
over
her
honored
men
And
all
her
great
men
have
been
bound
with
fetters
11
You
will
also
become
drunk
You
will
go
into
hiding
You
will
seek
refuge
from
the
enemy
12
All
your
fortifications
are
like
fig
trees
with
the
first
ripe
fruits
If
they
are
shaken
they
will
fall
into
the
mouth
of
devourers
13
Look
Your
troops
are
like
women
in
your
midst
The
gates
of
your
land
will
be
wide
open
for
your
enemies
Fire
will
consume
the
bars
of
your
gates
14
Draw
water
for
the
siege
Strengthen
your
fortifications
Go
down
into
the
mire
and
tread
the
clay
Grab
hold
of
the
brick
mold
15
Even
there
fire
will
consume
you
A
sword
will
cut
you
down
It
will
devour
you
as
the
young
locusts
do
Make
yourself
as
numerous
as
the
young
locusts
Yes
make
yourself
as
numerous
as
the
locusts
16
You
have
multiplied
your
merchants
more
than
the
stars
of
the
heavens
The
young
locust
strips
off
its
skin
and
flies
away
17
Your
guards
are
like
the
locust
And
your
officers
like
a
locust
swarm
They
camp
in
the
stone
pens
on
a
cold
day
But
when
the
sun
shines
they
fly
away
And
no
one
knows
where
they
are
18
Your
shepherds
are
drowsy
O
king
of
Assyria
Your
nobles
stay
in
their
residences
Your
people
are
scattered
on
the
mountains
And
no
one
is
gathering
them
together
19
There
is
no
relief
for
your
catastrophe
Your
wound
is
beyond
healing
All
those
hearing
the
report
about
you
will
clap
their
hands
For
who
has
not
suffered
from
your
relentless
cruelty
1
A
pronouncement
that
Habakkuk
the
prophet
received
in
a
vision

2
How
long
O
Jehovah
must
I
cry
for
help
but
you
do
not
hear
How
long
must
I
ask
for
help
from
violence
but
you
do
not
intervene

3
Why
do
you
make
me
witness
wrongdoing
And
why
do
you
tolerate
oppression
Why
are
destruction
and
violence
before
me
And
why
do
quarreling
and
conflict
abound

4
So
law
is
paralyzed
And
justice
is
never
carried
out
For
the
wicked
surround
the
righteous
That
is
why
justice
is
perverted

5
Look
among
the
nations
and
pay
attention
Stare
in
amazement
and
be
astounded
For
something
will
happen
in
your
daysThat
you
will
not
believe
even
if
it
is
told
to
you

6
For
here
I
am
raising
up
the
Chaldeans
The
ruthless
and
impetuous
nation
They
sweep
through
vast
stretches
of
the
earthTo
seize
homes
not
theirs

7
They
are
frightening
and
fearsome
They
establish
their
own
justice
and
authority

8
Their
horses
are
swifter
than
leopards
And
they
are
fiercer
than
wolves
in
the
night
Their
warhorses
gallop
forward
Their
horses
come
from
far
away
They
swoop
down
like
the
eagle
rushing
to
feed

9
All
of
them
come
bent
on
violence
The
assembling
of
their
faces
is
like
the
east
wind
And
they
scoop
up
captives
like
sand
10
They
scoff
at
kingsAnd
laugh
at
high
officials
They
laugh
at
every
fortified
place
They
pile
up
a
dirt
ramp
and
capture
it
11
Then
they
move
forward
like
the
wind
and
pass
through
But
they
will
become
guilty
Because
they
credit
their
power
to
their
god
12
Are
you
not
from
everlasting
O
Jehovah
O
my
God
my
Holy
One
you
do
not
die
O
Jehovah
you
appointed
them
to
execute
judgment
My
Rock
you
established
them
for
punishment
13
Your
eyes
are
too
pure
to
look
on
what
is
evil
And
you
cannot
tolerate
wickedness
Why
then
do
you
tolerate
the
treacherousAnd
keep
silent
when
a
wicked
man
swallows
up
someone
more
righteous
than
he
is
14
Why
do
you
make
man
like
the
fish
of
the
sea
Like
creeping
things
that
have
no
ruler
15
All
of
these
he
hauls
up
with
a
fishhook
He
catches
them
in
his
dragnet
And
he
gathers
them
in
his
fishing
net
That
is
why
he
rejoices
greatly
16
That
is
why
he
offers
sacrifices
to
his
dragnetAnd
makes
sacrifices
to
his
fishing
net
For
by
them
his
portion
is
rich
And
his
food
is
choice
17
Will
he
then
keep
emptying
out
his
dragnet
Will
he
go
on
slaughtering
nations
without
compassion
1
At
my
guardpost
I
will
keep
standing
And
I
will
station
myself
on
the
rampart
I
will
keep
watch
to
see
what
he
will
speak
by
means
of
meAnd
what
I
will
reply
when
I
am
reproved

2
Jehovah
then
answered
me
Write
down
the
vision
and
inscribe
it
clearly
on
tablets
So
that
the
one
reading
aloud
from
it
may
do
so
easily

3
For
the
vision
is
yet
for
its
appointed
time
And
it
is
rushing
toward
its
end
and
it
will
not
lie
Even
if
it
should
delay
keep
in
expectation
of
it
For
it
will
without
fail
come
true
It
will
not
be
late

4
Look
at
the
one
who
is
proud
He
is
not
upright
within
himself
But
the
righteous
one
will
live
by
his
faithfulness

5
Indeed
because
the
wine
is
treacherous
The
arrogant
man
will
not
reach
his
goal
He
makes
his
appetite
as
large
as
the
Grave
He
is
like
death
and
cannot
be
satisfied
He
keeps
gathering
all
the
nationsAnd
collecting
for
himself
all
the
peoples

6
Will
not
all
of
these
speak
a
proverb
an
allusion
and
riddles
against
him
They
will
say
Woe
to
him
who
accumulates
what
is
not
his—For
how
long—And
who
makes
even
greater
his
own
debt

7
Will
not
your
creditors
rise
up
suddenly
They
will
wake
up
and
violently
shake
you
And
you
will
become
something
for
them
to
plunder

8
Because
you
plundered
many
nations
All
the
rest
of
the
peoples
will
plunder
you
Because
of
your
shedding
mens
bloodAnd
your
violence
to
the
earth
To
the
cities
and
those
living
in
them

9
Woe
to
the
one
who
makes
evil
gain
for
his
house
So
as
to
set
his
nest
on
the
height
To
escape
the
grasp
of
calamity
10
You
have
plotted
shame
against
your
house
By
wiping
out
many
peoples
you
sin
against
yourself
11
For
a
stone
will
cry
out
from
the
wall
And
from
the
woodwork
a
rafter
will
answer
it
12
Woe
to
the
one
who
builds
a
city
by
bloodshed
And
who
establishes
a
town
by
unrighteousness
13
Look
Is
it
not
from
Jehovah
of
armies
that
peoples
will
work
hard
to
feed
the
fire
And
that
nations
tire
themselves
out
for
nothing
14
For
the
earth
will
be
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
JehovahAs
the
waters
cover
the
sea
15
Woe
to
the
one
who
gives
his
companions
something
to
drink
Adding
to
it
rage
and
anger
to
make
them
drunk
In
order
to
look
on
their
nakedness
16
You
will
be
glutted
with
dishonor
rather
than
glory
You
too—drink
and
expose
your
uncircumcised
condition
The
cup
in
the
right
hand
of
Jehovah
will
come
around
to
you
And
disgrace
will
cover
over
your
glory
17
For
the
violence
done
to
Lebanon
will
cover
you
And
the
destruction
that
terrified
the
beasts
will
come
upon
you
Because
of
your
shedding
mens
bloodAnd
your
violence
to
the
earth
To
the
cities
and
those
living
in
them
18
Of
what
benefit
is
a
carved
imageWhen
its
maker
has
carved
it
Of
what
benefit
is
a
metal
statue
and
a
teacher
of
lies
Even
though
its
maker
trusts
in
it
Making
worthless
gods
that
are
speechless
19
Woe
to
the
one
who
says
to
a
piece
of
wood
Awake
Or
to
a
speechless
stone
Wake
up
Instruct
us
Look
It
is
overlaid
in
gold
and
silver
And
there
is
no
breath
at
all
within
it
20
But
Jehovah
is
in
his
holy
temple
Be
silent
before
him
all
the
earth
1
The
prayer
of
Habakkuk
the
prophet
in
dirges

2
O
Jehovah
I
have
heard
the
report
about
you
I
am
in
awe
O
Jehovah
of
your
activity
In
the
midst
of
the
years
bring
it
to
life
In
the
midst
of
the
years
make
it
known
May
you
remember
to
show
mercy
during
the
turmoil

3
God
came
from
Teman
The
Holy
One
from
Mount
Paran
Selah
His
majesty
covered
the
heavens
With
his
praise
the
earth
was
filled

4
His
brightness
was
like
the
light
Two
rays
flashed
from
his
hand
Where
his
strength
was
hidden

5
Before
him
went
pestilence
And
burning
fever
followed
at
his
feet

6
He
stood
still
and
shook
the
earth
With
a
look
he
made
nations
leap
The
eternal
mountains
were
smashed
And
the
ancient
hills
bowed
down
The
paths
of
long
ago
are
his

7
I
saw
trouble
in
the
tents
of
Cushan
The
tent
cloths
of
the
land
of
Midian
trembled

8
Is
it
against
the
rivers
O
Jehovah
Is
it
against
the
rivers
that
your
anger
is
burning
Or
is
your
fury
against
the
sea
For
you
rode
on
your
horses
Your
chariots
were
victorious

9
Your
bow
is
uncovered
and
ready
The
rods
are
assigned
with
an
oath
Selah
You
split
the
earth
with
rivers
10
Mountains
writhed
in
pain
at
the
sight
of
you
A
downpour
of
waters
swept
through
The
deep
roared
with
its
voice
It
lifted
its
hands
high
11
Sun
and
moon
stood
still
in
their
lofty
abode
Your
arrows
went
out
like
the
light
The
lightning
of
your
spear
was
brilliant
12
You
marched
through
the
earth
with
indignation
You
trampled
the
nations
in
anger
13
You
went
out
for
the
salvation
of
your
people
to
save
your
anointed
one
You
crushed
the
leader
of
the
house
of
the
wicked
It
was
exposed
from
the
foundation
to
the
top
Selah
14
You
pierced
the
head
of
his
warriors
with
his
own
weaponsWhen
they
stormed
out
to
scatter
me
They
were
overjoyed
to
devour
an
afflicted
one
in
secret
15
Through
the
sea
you
trod
with
your
horses
Through
the
surging
of
vast
waters
16
I
heard
and
I
trembled
within
At
the
sound
my
lips
quivered
Rottenness
entered
my
bones
My
legs
beneath
me
were
shaking
But
I
quietly
wait
for
the
day
of
distress
For
it
is
coming
upon
the
people
who
attack
us
17
Although
the
fig
tree
may
not
blossom
And
there
may
be
no
fruit
on
the
vines
Although
the
olive
crop
may
fail
And
the
fields
may
produce
no
food
Although
the
flock
may
disappear
from
the
pen
And
there
may
be
no
cattle
in
the
stalls
18
Yet
as
for
me
I
will
exult
in
Jehovah
I
will
be
joyful
in
the
God
of
my
salvation
19
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
is
my
strength
He
will
make
my
feet
like
those
of
a
deerAnd
cause
me
to
tread
on
high
places
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
that
came
to
Zephaniah
son
of
Cushi
son
of
Gedaliah
son
of
Amariah
son
of
Hezekiah
in
the
days
of
Josiah
son
of
Amon
the
king
of
Judah

2
I
will
completely
sweep
away
everything
from
the
surface
of
the
ground

declares
Jehovah

3
I
will
sweep
away
man
and
beast
I
will
sweep
away
the
birds
of
the
heavens
and
the
fish
of
the
sea
And
the
stumbling
blocks
along
with
the
wicked
ones
And
I
will
remove
mankind
from
the
surface
of
the
ground

declares
Jehovah

4
I
will
stretch
out
my
hand
against
JudahAnd
against
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
And
I
will
wipe
out
from
this
place
every
vestige
of
Baal
The
name
of
the
foreign-god
priests
along
with
the
priests
5
And
those
who
bow
down
on
the
rooftops
to
the
army
of
the
heavens
And
those
who
bow
down
and
pledge
loyalty
to
JehovahWhile
pledging
loyalty
to
Malcam
6
And
those
who
turn
away
from
following
JehovahAnd
who
do
not
seek
Jehovah
or
inquire
of
him

7
Be
silent
before
the
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
for
the
day
of
Jehovah
is
near
Jehovah
has
prepared
a
sacrifice
he
has
sanctified
those
he
invited

8
On
the
day
of
Jehovahs
sacrifice
I
will
call
to
account
the
princes
The
sons
of
the
king
and
all
those
wearing
foreign
clothing

9
I
will
call
to
account
everyone
who
climbs
onto
the
platform
on
that
day
Those
who
fill
their
masters
house
with
violence
and
deception
10
On
that
day

declares
Jehovah
There
will
be
the
sound
of
an
outcry
from
the
Fish
Gate
A
wailing
from
the
second
quarter
of
the
city
And
a
loud
crash
from
the
hills
11
Wail
you
inhabitants
of
Maktesh
For
all
the
tradesmen
have
been
done
away
with
All
those
weighing
out
silver
have
been
destroyed
12
At
that
time
I
will
carefully
search
Jerusalem
with
lamps
And
I
will
call
to
account
the
complacent
ones
who
say
in
their
heart
Jehovah
will
not
do
good
and
he
will
not
do
bad
13
Their
wealth
will
be
plundered
and
their
houses
will
be
devastated
They
will
build
houses
but
they
will
not
occupy
them
And
they
will
plant
vineyards
but
they
will
not
drink
wine
from
them
14
The
great
day
of
Jehovah
is
near
It
is
near
and
it
is
approaching
very
quickly
The
sound
of
the
day
of
Jehovah
is
bitter
There
a
warrior
cries
out
15
That
day
is
a
day
of
fury
A
day
of
distress
and
anguish
A
day
of
storm
and
desolation
A
day
of
darkness
and
gloom
A
day
of
clouds
and
thick
gloom
16
A
day
of
the
horn
and
of
the
battle
cry
Against
the
fortified
cities
and
against
the
high
corner
towers
17
I
will
cause
distress
to
mankind
And
they
will
walk
like
blind
men
Because
it
is
against
Jehovah
they
have
sinned
Their
blood
will
be
poured
out
like
dust
And
their
flesh
like
the
dung
18
Neither
their
silver
nor
their
gold
will
be
able
to
save
them
in
the
day
of
Jehovahs
fury
For
by
the
fire
of
his
zeal
the
whole
earth
will
be
consumed
Because
he
will
make
an
extermination
indeed
a
terrible
one
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
1
Gather
together
yes
gather
yourselves
O
nation
that
feels
no
shame

2
Before
the
decree
takes
effect
Before
the
day
passes
by
like
chaff
Before
the
burning
anger
of
Jehovah
comes
upon
you
Before
the
day
of
Jehovahs
anger
comes
upon
you
3
Seek
Jehovah
all
you
meek
ones
of
the
earth
Who
observe
his
righteous
decrees
Seek
righteousness
seek
meekness
Probably
you
will
be
concealed
on
the
day
of
Jehovahs
anger

4
For
Gaza
will
be
an
abandoned
city
And
Ashkelon
will
be
desolated
Ashdod
will
be
driven
away
in
broad
daylight
And
Ekron
will
be
uprooted

5
Woe
to
those
who
inhabit
the
seacoast
the
nation
of
Cherethites
The
word
of
Jehovah
is
against
you
O
Canaan
land
of
the
Philistines
I
will
destroy
you
So
that
there
will
be
no
inhabitant
left

6
And
the
seacoast
will
become
pasture
grounds
With
wells
for
shepherds
and
stone
pens
for
sheep

7
It
will
become
a
region
for
the
remaining
ones
of
the
house
of
Judah
There
they
will
feed
In
the
houses
of
Ashkelon
they
will
lie
down
in
the
evening
For
Jehovah
their
God
will
turn
his
attention
to
them
And
he
will
gather
back
their
captives

8
I
have
heard
the
reproach
by
Moab
and
the
insults
of
the
Ammonites
Who
have
taunted
my
people
and
made
boasts
against
their
territory

9
Therefore
as
surely
as
I
am
alive

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
the
God
of
Israel
Moab
will
become
just
like
Sodom
And
the
Ammonites
like
Gomorrah
A
place
of
nettles
a
salt
pit
and
a
permanent
wasteland
The
remaining
ones
of
my
people
will
plunder
them
And
the
remnant
of
my
nation
will
dispossess
them
10
This
is
what
they
will
have
instead
of
their
pride
Because
they
taunted
and
exalted
themselves
against
the
people
of
Jehovah
of
armies
11
Jehovah
will
be
awe-inspiring
against
them
For
he
will
bring
to
nothing
all
the
gods
of
the
earth
And
all
the
islands
of
the
nations
will
bow
down
to
him
Each
one
from
its
place
12
You
Ethiopians
will
also
be
slain
by
my
sword
13
He
will
stretch
out
his
hand
toward
the
north
and
destroy
Assyria
And
he
will
make
Nineveh
desolate
as
dry
as
a
desert
14
Herds
will
lie
down
within
her
all
sorts
of
wild
animals
Both
pelican
and
porcupine
will
spend
the
night
among
her
pillar
capitals
A
voice
will
sing
in
the
window
There
will
be
devastation
at
the
threshold
For
he
will
expose
the
cedar
panels
15
This
is
the
proud
city
that
was
sitting
in
security
That
was
saying
in
her
heart
I
am
the
one
and
there
is
nobody
else
How
she
has
become
an
object
of
horror
A
place
for
the
wild
animals
to
lie
down
Everyone
passing
by
her
will
whistle
and
shake
his
fist
1
Woe
to
the
rebellious
the
polluted
the
oppressive
city

2
She
has
obeyed
no
voice
she
has
accepted
no
discipline
In
Jehovah
she
has
not
trusted
she
has
not
drawn
near
to
her
God

3
Her
princes
within
her
are
roaring
lions
Her
judges
are
wolves
in
the
night
They
do
not
leave
even
a
bone
to
gnaw
until
morning

4
Her
prophets
are
insolent
treacherous
men
Her
priests
defile
what
is
holy
They
do
violence
to
the
law

5
Jehovah
is
righteous
in
her
midst
he
does
no
wrong
Morning
by
morning
he
makes
known
his
judgments
As
unfailing
as
the
daylight
But
the
unrighteous
one
knows
no
shame

6
I
destroyed
nations
their
corner
towers
were
left
desolate
I
devastated
their
streets
so
that
no
one
was
passing
through
Their
cities
were
left
in
ruins
without
a
man
without
an
inhabitant

7
I
said
Surely
you
will
fear
me
and
accept
discipline

So
that
her
dwelling
place
might
not
be
destroyed—I
must
call
her
to
account
for
all
these
things
But
they
were
all
the
more
eager
to
act
corruptly

8
So
keep
yourselves
in
expectation
of
me

declares
Jehovah
Until
the
day
when
I
rise
up
to
take
plunder
For
my
judicial
decision
is
to
gather
nations
to
assemble
kingdoms
To
pour
out
on
them
my
indignation
all
my
burning
anger
For
by
the
fire
of
my
zeal
the
whole
earth
will
be
consumed

9
For
then
I
will
change
the
language
of
the
peoples
to
a
pure
language
So
that
all
of
them
may
call
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
To
serve
him
shoulder
to
shoulder
10
From
the
region
of
the
rivers
of
Ethiopia
Those
entreating
me
the
daughter
of
my
scattered
ones
will
bring
a
gift
to
me
11
On
that
day
you
will
not
be
put
to
shameBecause
of
all
your
deeds
with
which
you
rebelled
against
me
For
then
I
will
remove
the
haughty
boasters
from
among
you
And
you
will
never
again
be
haughty
in
my
holy
mountain
12
I
will
allow
a
humble
and
lowly
people
to
remain
in
your
midst
And
they
will
take
refuge
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
13
Those
remaining
of
Israel
will
practice
no
unrighteousness
They
will
not
speak
a
lie
nor
will
a
deceitful
tongue
be
found
in
their
mouths
They
will
feed
and
lie
down
and
no
one
will
make
them
afraid
14
Shout
joyfully
O
daughter
of
Zion
Shout
in
triumph
O
Israel
Be
joyful
and
rejoice
with
all
your
heart
O
daughter
of
Jerusalem
15
Jehovah
has
removed
the
judgments
against
you
He
has
turned
away
your
enemy
The
King
of
Israel
Jehovah
is
in
your
midst
You
will
fear
calamity
no
more
16
On
that
day
it
will
be
said
to
Jerusalem
Do
not
be
afraid
O
Zion
Do
not
let
your
hands
drop
down
17
Jehovah
your
God
is
in
your
midst
As
a
mighty
One
he
will
save
He
will
exult
over
you
with
great
joy
He
will
become
silent
in
his
love
He
will
rejoice
over
you
with
shouts
of
joy
18
I
will
gather
together
those
grieving
over
their
absence
from
your
festivals
They
were
absent
from
you
because
of
bearing
reproach
for
her
19
Look
At
that
time
I
will
act
against
all
those
oppressing
you
And
I
will
save
the
one
limping
And
I
will
gather
together
the
dispersed
I
will
make
them
an
object
of
praise
and
fameIn
all
the
land
of
their
shame
20
At
that
time
I
will
bring
you
in
At
the
time
I
gather
you
together
For
I
will
make
you
an
object
of
fame
and
praise
among
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
When
I
gather
back
your
captives
before
your
eyes

says
Jehovah
1
In
the
second
year
of
King
Darius
in
the
sixth
month
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
through
Haggai
the
prophet
to
Zerubbabel
son
of
Shealtiel
the
governor
of
Judah
and
to
Joshua
son
of
Jehozadak
the
high
priest
saying
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
These
people
say
The
time
has
not
yet
come
for
the
house
of
Jehovah
to
be
built
3
And
the
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
through
Haggai
the
prophet
saying
4
Is
it
the
time
for
you
to
dwell
in
your
paneled
houses
while
this
house
lies
in
ruins
5
Now
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Set
your
heart
on
your
ways
6
You
have
sown
much
seed
but
you
harvest
little
You
eat
but
it
is
not
to
satisfaction
You
drink
but
you
do
not
drink
your
fill
You
put
on
clothing
but
no
one
gets
warm
The
one
who
hires
himself
out
puts
his
wages
in
a
bag
full
of
holes
7
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Set
your
heart
on
your
ways
8
Go
up
to
the
mountain
and
bring
in
lumber
And
build
the
house
so
that
I
may
take
pleasure
in
it
and
I
may
be
glorified

Jehovah
says
9
You
were
expecting
much
and
receiving
little
and
when
you
brought
it
into
the
house
I
blew
it
away
For
what
reason
declares
Jehovah
of
armies
Because
my
house
is
in
ruins
while
each
of
you
runs
around
taking
care
of
his
own
house
10
So
the
heavens
above
you
withheld
their
dew
and
the
earth
withheld
its
produce
11
And
I
kept
calling
for
a
drought
on
the
earth
on
the
mountains
on
the
grain
on
the
new
wine
on
the
oil
on
what
grows
from
the
ground
on
humans
and
livestock
and
on
all
the
labor
of
your
hands
12
Zerubbabel
son
of
Shealtiel
and
Joshua
son
of
Jehozadak
the
high
priest
and
all
the
rest
of
the
people
listened
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
their
God
and
to
the
words
of
Haggai
the
prophet
because
Jehovah
their
God
had
sent
him
and
the
people
began
to
show
fear
because
of
Jehovah
13
Then
Haggai
the
messenger
of
Jehovah
gave
this
message
to
the
people
in
harmony
with
his
commission
from
Jehovah
I
am
with
you
people

declares
Jehovah
14
So
Jehovah
stirred
up
the
spirit
of
Zerubbabel
the
son
of
Shealtiel
the
governor
of
Judah
and
the
spirit
of
Joshua
the
son
of
Jehozadak
the
high
priest
and
the
spirit
of
all
the
rest
of
the
people
and
they
came
and
began
to
work
on
the
house
of
Jehovah
of
armies
their
God
15
This
was
on
the
24th
day
of
the
sixth
month
in
the
second
year
of
King
Darius
1
In
the
seventh
month
on
the
21st
day
of
the
month
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
through
Haggai
the
prophet
saying
2
Please
ask
Zerubbabel
son
of
Shealtiel
the
governor
of
Judah
and
Joshua
son
of
Jehozadak
the
high
priest
and
the
rest
of
the
people
3
Who
is
left
among
you
who
saw
this
house
in
its
former
glory
How
does
it
look
to
you
now
Does
it
not
seem
like
nothing
in
comparison
4
But
now
be
strong
Zerubbabel

declares
Jehovah
and
be
strong
Joshua
son
of
Jehozadak
the
high
priest
And
be
strong
all
you
people
of
the
land

declares
Jehovah
and
work
For
I
am
with
you

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
5
Remember
what
I
promised
you
when
you
came
out
of
Egypt
and
my
spirit
remains
among
you
Do
not
be
afraid
6
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Yet
once
more—in
a
little
while—and
I
will
shake
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
dry
land
7
And
I
will
shake
all
the
nations
and
the
precious
things
of
all
the
nations
will
come
in
and
I
will
fill
this
house
with
glory

says
Jehovah
of
armies
8
The
silver
is
mine
and
the
gold
is
mine

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
9
The
future
glory
of
this
house
will
be
greater
than
the
former

says
Jehovah
of
armies
And
in
this
place
I
will
grant
peace

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
10
On
the
24th
day
of
the
ninth
month
in
the
second
year
of
Darius
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Haggai
the
prophet
saying
11
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Ask
please
the
priests
about
the
law
12
If
a
man
carries
holy
flesh
in
the
fold
of
his
clothing
and
his
clothing
touches
bread
or
stew
or
wine
or
oil
or
any
sort
of
food
will
it
become
holy
The
priests
answered
No
13
Haggai
then
asked
If
someone
who
is
unclean
from
contact
with
a
dead
body
touches
any
of
these
things
will
it
become
unclean
The
priests
answered
It
will
become
unclean
14
So
Haggai
said
That
is
how
this
people
is
and
that
is
how
this
nation
is
before
me

declares
Jehovah
and
that
is
how
all
the
work
of
their
hands
is
whatever
they
present
there
is
unclean
15
But
now
please
set
your
heart
on
this
from
this
day
forward
Before
a
stone
was
placed
on
a
stone
in
the
temple
of
Jehovah
16
how
was
it
then
When
someone
came
to
a
heap
of
grain
expecting
20
measures
there
were
only
10
and
when
someone
came
to
the
vat
to
draw
50
measures
from
the
wine
trough
there
were
only
20
17
I
struck
you—all
the
works
of
your
hands—with
scorching
blight
and
mildew
and
hail
but
not
one
of
you
turned
to
me

declares
Jehovah
18
Please
set
your
heart
on
this
from
this
day
forward
from
the
24th
day
of
the
ninth
month
from
the
day
that
the
foundation
of
the
temple
of
Jehovah
was
laid
set
your
heart
on
this
19
Is
there
seed
yet
in
the
storehouse
The
vine
the
fig
the
pomegranate
and
the
olive
tree—they
have
not
yet
borne
fruit
have
they
From
this
day
I
will
send
a
blessing
20
The
word
of
Jehovah
came
a
second
time
to
Haggai
on
the
24th
day
of
the
month
saying
21
Say
to
Zerubbabel
the
governor
of
Judah
I
am
going
to
shake
the
heavens
and
the
earth
22
I
will
overthrow
the
throne
of
kingdoms
and
annihilate
the
strength
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
nations
and
I
will
overthrow
the
chariot
and
its
riders
and
the
horses
and
their
riders
will
fall
each
one
by
the
sword
of
his
brother
23
In
that
day

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
I
will
take
you
my
servant
Zerubbabel
son
of
Shealtiel

declares
Jehovah
and
I
will
make
you
like
a
seal
ring
because
you
are
the
one
whom
I
have
chosen

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
1
In
the
eighth
month
in
the
second
year
of
Darius
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
the
prophet
Zechariah
son
of
Berechiah
son
of
Iddo
saying
2
Jehovah
grew
greatly
indignant
at
your
fathers
3
Say
to
them
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Return
to
me

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
and
I
will
return
to
you

says
Jehovah
of
armies
4
Do
not
become
like
your
fathers
to
whom
the
former
prophets
proclaimed
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Turn
away
please
from
your
evil
ways
and
your
evil
deeds
But
they
did
not
listen
and
they
paid
no
attention
to
me

declares
Jehovah
5
Where
are
your
fathers
now
And
did
the
prophets
live
forever
6
However
my
words
and
my
decrees
that
I
commanded
my
servants
the
prophets
caught
up
with
your
fathers
did
they
not
So
they
returned
to
me
and
said
Jehovah
of
armies
has
dealt
with
us
according
to
our
ways
and
our
deeds
just
as
he
had
determined
to
do
7
On
the
24th
day
of
the
11th
month
that
is
the
month
of
Shebat
in
the
second
year
of
Darius
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
the
prophet
Zechariah
son
of
Berechiah
son
of
Iddo
saying
8
I
saw
a
vision
in
the
night
There
was
a
man
riding
on
a
red
horse
and
he
stood
still
among
the
myrtle
trees
in
the
ravine
and
behind
him
there
were
red
reddish-brown
and
white
horses
9
So
I
said
Who
are
these
my
lord
The
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
replied
I
will
show
you
who
these
are
10
Then
the
man
who
was
standing
still
among
the
myrtle
trees
said
These
are
the
ones
whom
Jehovah
has
sent
out
to
walk
about
in
the
earth
11
And
they
said
to
the
angel
of
Jehovah
who
was
standing
among
the
myrtle
trees
We
have
walked
about
in
the
earth
and
look
the
whole
earth
is
quiet
and
undisturbed
12
So
the
angel
of
Jehovah
said
O
Jehovah
of
armies
how
long
will
you
withhold
your
mercy
from
Jerusalem
and
the
cities
of
Judah
with
whom
you
have
been
indignant
these
70
years
13
Jehovah
answered
the
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
with
kind
and
comforting
words
14
Then
the
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
told
me
Call
out
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
I
am
zealous
for
Jerusalem
and
for
Zion
with
a
great
zeal
15
With
great
indignation
I
am
indignant
with
the
nations
that
are
at
ease
because
I
felt
indignant
to
a
small
extent
but
they
added
to
the
calamity
16
Therefore
this
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
will
return
to
Jerusalem
with
mercy
and
my
own
house
will
be
built
in
her

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
and
a
measuring
line
will
be
stretched
out
over
Jerusalem
17
Call
out
once
more
and
say
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
My
cities
will
again
overflow
with
goodness
and
Jehovah
will
again
comfort
Zion
and
again
choose
Jerusalem
18
Then
I
looked
up
and
saw
four
horns
19
So
I
asked
the
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
What
are
these
He
replied
These
are
the
horns
that
dispersed
Judah
Israel
and
Jerusalem
20
Jehovah
then
showed
me
four
craftsmen
21
I
asked
What
are
these
coming
to
do
He
said
These
are
the
horns
that
dispersed
Judah
to
such
an
extent
that
no
one
was
able
to
raise
his
head
These
others
will
come
to
terrify
them
to
cast
down
the
horns
of
the
nations
that
lifted
up
their
horns
against
the
land
of
Judah
in
order
to
disperse
her
1
And
I
looked
up
and
saw
a
man
with
a
measuring
line
in
his
hand
2
So
I
asked
Where
are
you
going
He
replied
To
measure
Jerusalem
to
see
what
is
her
width
and
what
is
her
length
3
And
look
the
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
went
out
and
another
angel
came
to
meet
him
4
Then
he
said
to
him
Run
over
there
and
tell
that
young
man
Jerusalem
will
be
inhabited
as
open
rural
country
because
of
all
the
men
and
livestock
within
her
5
And
I
will
become
to
her

declares
Jehovah
a
wall
of
fire
all
around
and
I
will
become
the
glory
in
her
midst
6
Come
Come
Flee
from
the
land
of
the
north

declares
Jehovah
For
I
have
scattered
you
to
the
four
winds
of
the
heavens

declares
Jehovah
7
Come
Zion
Make
your
escape
you
who
are
dwelling
with
the
daughter
of
Babylon
8
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
who
after
being
glorified
has
sent
me
to
the
nations
that
were
plundering
you
Whoever
touches
you
touches
the
pupil
of
my
eye
9
For
now
I
will
wave
my
hand
against
them
and
they
will
become
plunder
for
their
own
slaves
And
you
will
certainly
know
that
Jehovah
of
armies
has
sent
me
10
Shout
for
joy
O
daughter
of
Zion
for
I
am
coming
and
I
will
reside
in
your
midst

declares
Jehovah
11
Many
nations
will
join
themselves
to
Jehovah
in
that
day
and
they
will
become
my
people
and
I
will
reside
in
your
midst
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
Jehovah
of
armies
has
sent
me
to
you
12
Jehovah
will
take
possession
of
Judah
as
his
portion
on
the
holy
ground
and
he
will
again
choose
Jerusalem
13
Be
silent
all
flesh
before
Jehovah
for
he
is
taking
action
from
his
holy
dwelling
1
And
he
showed
me
Joshua
the
high
priest
standing
before
the
angel
of
Jehovah
and
Satan
was
standing
at
his
right
hand
to
resist
him
2
Then
the
angel
of
Jehovah
said
to
Satan
May
Jehovah
rebuke
you
O
Satan
yes
may
Jehovah
who
has
chosen
Jerusalem
rebuke
you
Is
not
this
one
a
burning
log
snatched
out
of
the
fire
3
Now
Joshua
was
clothed
in
filthy
garments
and
standing
before
the
angel
4
The
angel
said
to
those
standing
before
him
Remove
his
filthy
garments
Then
he
said
to
him
See
I
have
caused
your
error
to
pass
away
from
you
and
you
will
be
clothed
with
fine
garments
5
So
I
said
Let
a
clean
turban
be
put
on
his
head
And
they
put
the
clean
turban
on
his
head
and
clothed
him
with
garments
and
the
angel
of
Jehovah
was
standing
nearby
6
The
angel
of
Jehovah
then
declared
to
Joshua
7
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
If
you
will
walk
in
my
ways
and
carry
out
your
responsibilities
before
me
then
you
will
serve
as
a
judge
in
my
house
and
take
care
of
my
courtyards
and
I
will
give
you
free
access
among
these
who
are
standing
here
8
Hear
please
O
High
Priest
Joshua
you
and
your
companions
who
sit
before
you
for
these
men
serve
as
a
sign
look
I
am
bringing
in
my
servant
Sprout
9
See
the
stone
that
I
have
set
before
Joshua
On
the
one
stone
are
seven
eyes
and
I
am
engraving
an
inscription
on
it

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
and
I
will
take
away
the
guilt
of
that
land
in
one
day
10
In
that
day

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
Each
of
you
will
invite
your
neighbor
to
come
under
your
vine
and
under
your
fig
tree
1
The
angel
who
had
been
speaking
with
me
came
back
and
woke
me
up
as
when
waking
someone
from
sleep
2
Then
he
said
to
me
What
do
you
see
So
I
said
I
see
and
look
a
lampstand
entirely
of
gold
with
a
bowl
on
top
of
it
There
are
seven
lamps
on
it
yes
seven
and
the
lamps
which
are
at
the
top
of
it
have
seven
pipes
3
And
next
to
it
are
two
olive
trees
one
on
the
right
of
the
bowl
and
one
on
the
left
4
Then
I
asked
the
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
What
do
these
things
mean
my
lord
5
So
the
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
asked
Do
you
not
know
what
these
things
mean
I
replied
No
my
lord
6
He
then
said
to
me
This
is
the
word
of
Jehovah
to
Zerubbabel
Not
by
a
military
force
nor
by
power
but
by
my
spirit

says
Jehovah
of
armies
7
Who
are
you
O
great
mountain
Before
Zerubbabel
you
will
become
a
level
land
And
he
will
bring
out
the
top
stone
amid
shouts
of
How
wonderful
How
wonderful
8
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
9
The
hands
of
Zerubbabel
have
laid
the
foundation
of
this
house
and
his
own
hands
will
finish
it
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
Jehovah
of
armies
has
sent
me
to
you
10
For
who
has
despised
the
day
of
small
beginnings
For
they
will
rejoice
and
see
the
plumb
line
in
the
hand
of
Zerubbabel
These
seven
are
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
which
are
roving
about
in
all
the
earth
11
Then
I
asked
him
What
is
the
meaning
of
these
two
olive
trees
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
of
the
lampstand
12
I
asked
him
a
second
time
What
is
the
meaning
of
the
two
bunches
of
twigs
of
the
olive
trees
that
are
pouring
out
the
golden
liquid
through
the
two
golden
tubes
13
So
he
asked
me
Do
you
not
know
what
these
things
mean
I
replied
No
my
lord
14
He
said
These
are
the
two
anointed
ones
who
are
standing
alongside
the
Lord
of
the
whole
earth
1
Again
I
looked
up
and
I
saw
a
flying
scroll
2
He
asked
me
What
do
you
see
I
replied
I
see
a
flying
scroll
which
is
20
cubits
long
and
10
cubits
wide
3
Then
he
said
to
me
This
is
the
curse
that
is
going
out
over
the
face
of
all
the
earth
because
everyone
who
steals
as
written
on
its
one
side
has
gone
unpunished
and
everyone
who
makes
a
sworn
oath
as
written
on
its
other
side
has
gone
unpunished
4
I
have
sent
it
out

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
and
it
will
enter
into
the
house
of
the
thief
and
into
the
house
of
the
one
who
makes
a
false
oath
in
my
name
and
it
will
remain
inside
that
house
and
consume
it
and
its
timbers
and
its
stones
5
Then
the
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
came
forward
and
said
to
me
Look
up
please
and
see
what
is
going
out
6
So
I
asked
What
is
it
He
replied
This
is
the
ephah
container
that
is
going
out
He
continued
This
is
their
appearance
in
all
the
earth
7
And
I
saw
that
the
round
lid
of
lead
was
lifted
up
and
there
was
a
woman
sitting
inside
the
container
8
So
he
said
This
is
Wickedness
Then
he
threw
her
back
into
the
ephah
container
after
which
he
thrust
the
lead
weight
over
its
mouth
9
Then
I
looked
up
and
saw
two
women
coming
forward
and
they
were
soaring
in
the
wind
They
had
wings
like
the
wings
of
a
stork
And
they
lifted
up
the
container
between
the
earth
and
heaven
10
So
I
asked
the
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
Where
are
they
taking
the
ephah
container
11
He
replied
To
the
land
of
Shinar
to
build
her
a
house
and
when
it
is
prepared
she
will
be
deposited
there
in
her
proper
place
1
Then
I
looked
up
again
and
saw
four
chariots
coming
from
between
two
mountains
and
the
mountains
were
of
copper
2
The
first
chariot
had
red
horses
and
the
second
chariot
black
horses
3
The
third
chariot
had
white
horses
and
the
fourth
chariot
speckled
and
dappled
horses
4
I
asked
the
angel
who
was
speaking
with
me
What
are
these
my
lord
5
The
angel
answered
me
These
are
the
four
spirits
of
the
heavens
that
are
going
out
after
having
taken
their
station
before
the
Lord
of
the
whole
earth
6
The
one
with
the
black
horses
is
going
out
to
the
land
of
the
north
the
white
ones
are
going
out
beyond
the
sea
and
the
speckled
ones
are
going
out
to
the
land
of
the
south
7
And
the
dappled
ones
were
eager
to
go
out
to
walk
about
through
the
earth
Then
he
said
Go
walk
about
through
the
earth
And
they
began
walking
about
through
the
earth
8
He
then
called
out
to
me
and
said
See
those
going
out
to
the
land
of
the
north
have
caused
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
to
rest
in
the
land
of
the
north
9
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
me
saying
10
Take
from
Heldai
Tobijah
and
Jedaiah
what
they
brought
from
the
people
in
exile
and
on
that
day
you
must
go
to
the
house
of
Josiah
the
son
of
Zephaniah
along
with
these
who
have
come
from
Babylon
11
You
should
take
silver
and
gold
and
make
a
crown
and
put
it
on
the
head
of
Joshua
son
of
Jehozadak
the
high
priest
12
And
say
to
him
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Here
is
the
man
whose
name
is
Sprout
He
will
sprout
from
his
own
place
and
he
will
build
the
temple
of
Jehovah
13
He
is
the
one
who
will
build
the
temple
of
Jehovah
and
he
is
the
one
who
will
assume
the
majesty
He
will
sit
down
on
his
throne
and
rule
and
he
will
also
be
a
priest
on
his
throne
and
there
will
be
a
peaceable
agreement
between
the
two
14
And
the
crown
will
serve
as
a
memorial
for
Helem
Tobijah
Jedaiah
and
Hen
the
son
of
Zephaniah
in
the
temple
of
Jehovah
15
And
those
who
are
far
away
will
come
and
take
part
in
building
the
temple
of
Jehovah
And
you
will
have
to
know
that
Jehovah
of
armies
has
sent
me
to
you
And
it
will
occur—if
you
do
not
fail
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
Jehovah
your
God
1
And
in
the
fourth
year
of
King
Darius
the
word
of
Jehovah
came
to
Zechariah
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
ninth
month
that
is
the
month
of
Chislev
2
The
people
of
Bethel
sent
Sharezer
and
Regem-melech
and
his
men
to
beg
for
the
favor
of
Jehovah
3
saying
to
the
priests
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
of
armies
and
to
the
prophets
Should
I
weep
in
the
fifth
month
and
abstain
from
food
as
I
have
done
for
so
many
years
4
The
word
of
Jehovah
of
armies
again
came
to
me
saying
5
Say
to
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
to
the
priests
When
you
fasted
and
wailed
in
the
fifth
month
and
in
the
seventh
month
for
70
years
did
you
really
fast
for
me
6
And
when
you
would
eat
and
drink
were
you
not
eating
for
yourselves
and
drinking
for
yourselves
7
Should
you
not
obey
the
words
that
Jehovah
proclaimed
through
the
former
prophets
while
Jerusalem
and
her
surrounding
cities
were
inhabited
and
at
peace
and
while
the
Negeb
and
the
Shephelah
were
inhabited
8
The
word
of
Jehovah
again
came
to
Zechariah
saying
9
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Judge
with
true
justice
and
deal
with
one
another
in
loyal
love
and
mercy
10
Do
not
defraud
the
widow
or
the
fatherless
child
the
foreigner
or
the
poor
and
do
not
scheme
evil
against
one
another
in
your
hearts
11
But
they
kept
refusing
to
pay
attention
and
they
stubbornly
turned
their
backs
and
they
stopped
up
their
ears
so
as
not
to
hear
12
They
made
their
heart
like
a
diamond
and
would
not
obey
the
law
and
the
words
that
Jehovah
of
armies
sent
by
his
spirit
through
the
former
prophets
So
there
came
great
indignation
from
Jehovah
of
armies
13
Just
as
they
did
not
listen
when
I
called
so
I
would
not
listen
when
they
called

says
Jehovah
of
armies
14
And
I
scattered
them
with
a
storm
wind
throughout
all
the
nations
that
they
had
not
known
and
the
land
was
left
desolate
behind
them
with
no
one
passing
through
or
returning
for
they
turned
the
desirable
land
into
an
object
of
horror
1
The
word
of
Jehovah
of
armies
again
came
saying
2
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
I
will
be
zealous
for
Zion
with
a
great
zeal
and
with
great
wrath
I
will
be
zealous
for
her
3
This
is
what
Jehovah
says
I
will
return
to
Zion
and
reside
in
Jerusalem
and
Jerusalem
will
be
called
the
city
of
truth
and
the
mountain
of
Jehovah
of
armies
the
holy
mountain
4
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Old
men
and
women
will
again
sit
in
the
public
squares
of
Jerusalem
each
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
because
of
his
great
age
5
And
the
public
squares
of
the
city
will
be
filled
with
boys
and
girls
playing
there
6
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Although
it
may
seem
too
difficult
to
the
remaining
ones
of
this
people
in
those
days
should
it
seem
too
difficult
also
to
me
declares
Jehovah
of
armies
7
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Here
I
am
saving
my
people
from
the
lands
of
the
east
and
the
west
8
And
I
will
bring
them
in
and
they
will
reside
in
Jerusalem
and
they
will
become
my
people
and
I
will
become
their
God
in
truth
and
in
righteousness
9
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Let
your
hands
be
strong
you
who
now
hear
these
words
from
the
mouth
of
the
prophets
the
same
words
that
were
spoken
on
the
day
the
foundation
of
the
house
of
Jehovah
of
armies
was
laid
for
the
temple
to
be
built
10
For
before
that
time
there
were
no
wages
being
paid
either
for
man
or
for
beast
and
it
was
not
safe
to
come
and
go
because
of
the
adversary
for
I
turned
all
men
one
against
another
11
But
now
I
will
not
deal
with
the
remaining
ones
of
this
people
as
in
the
former
days

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
12
For
the
seed
of
peace
will
be
sown
the
vine
will
produce
its
fruit
and
the
earth
its
yield
and
the
heavens
will
give
their
dew
and
I
will
cause
the
remaining
ones
of
this
people
to
inherit
all
these
things
13
And
just
as
you
became
an
object
of
cursing
among
the
nations
O
house
of
Judah
and
house
of
Israel
so
I
will
save
you
and
you
will
become
a
blessing
Do
not
be
afraid
Let
your
hands
be
strong
14
For
this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
Just
as
I
had
determined
to
bring
calamity
on
you
because
your
forefathers
made
me
indignant

says
Jehovah
of
armies
and
I
felt
no
regret
15
so
at
this
time
I
have
determined
to
do
good
to
Jerusalem
and
to
the
house
of
Judah
Do
not
be
afraid
16
These
are
the
things
you
should
do
Speak
the
truth
with
one
another
and
the
judgments
in
your
gates
must
promote
truth
and
peace
17
Do
not
scheme
calamity
against
one
another
in
your
hearts
and
do
not
love
any
false
oath
for
these
are
all
things
that
I
hate

declares
Jehovah
18
The
word
of
Jehovah
of
armies
again
came
to
me
saying
19
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
The
fast
of
the
fourth
month
the
fast
of
the
fifth
month
the
fast
of
the
seventh
month
and
the
fast
of
the
tenth
month
will
be
occasions
for
exultation
and
joy
for
the
house
of
Judah—festivals
of
rejoicing
So
love
truth
and
peace
20
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
It
will
yet
come
to
pass
that
peoples
and
the
inhabitants
of
many
cities
will
come
21
and
the
inhabitants
of
one
city
will
go
to
those
of
another
and
say
Let
us
earnestly
go
to
beg
for
the
favor
of
Jehovah
and
to
seek
Jehovah
of
armies
I
am
also
going
22
And
many
peoples
and
mighty
nations
will
come
to
seek
Jehovah
of
armies
in
Jerusalem
and
to
beg
for
the
favor
of
Jehovah
23
This
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
In
those
days
ten
men
out
of
all
the
languages
of
the
nations
will
take
hold
yes
they
will
take
firm
hold
of
the
robe
of
a
Jew
saying
We
want
to
go
with
you
for
we
have
heard
that
God
is
with
you
people
1
A
pronouncement
The
word
of
Jehovah
is
against
the
land
of
Hadrach
And
Damascus
is
its
target—For
Jehovahs
eye
is
on
mankindAnd
on
all
the
tribes
of
Israel—
2
And
against
Hamath
which
borders
on
her
And
against
Tyre
and
Sidon
for
they
are
so
wise

3
Tyre
built
herself
a
rampart
She
piled
up
silver
like
dustAnd
gold
like
the
dirt
of
the
streets

4
Look
Jehovah
will
take
away
her
possessions
And
he
will
strike
down
her
army
into
the
sea
And
she
will
be
consumed
in
the
fire

5
Ashkelon
will
see
it
and
be
afraid
Gaza
will
feel
great
anguish
Also
Ekron
because
her
hope
is
put
to
shame
A
king
will
perish
from
Gaza
And
Ashkelon
will
not
be
inhabited

6
An
illegitimate
son
will
settle
in
Ashdod
And
I
will
do
away
with
the
pride
of
the
Philistine

7
I
will
remove
the
bloodstained
things
from
his
mouthAnd
the
disgusting
things
from
between
his
teeth
And
he
will
be
left
remaining
for
our
God
And
he
will
become
like
a
sheikh
in
Judah
And
Ekron
like
the
Jebusite

8
I
will
encamp
as
a
guard
for
my
house
So
that
there
will
be
no
one
passing
through
and
no
one
returning
And
no
taskmaster
will
pass
through
again
For
now
I
have
seen
it
with
my
eyes

9
Rejoice
greatly
O
daughter
of
Zion
Shout
in
triumph
O
daughter
of
Jerusalem
Look
Your
king
is
coming
to
you
He
is
righteous
bringing
salvation
Humble
and
riding
on
a
donkey
On
a
colt
the
foal
of
a
female
donkey
10
I
will
take
away
the
war
chariot
from
EphraimAnd
the
horse
from
Jerusalem
The
battle
bow
will
be
taken
away
And
he
will
proclaim
peace
to
the
nations
His
rulership
will
be
from
sea
to
seaAnd
from
the
River
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
11
As
for
you
O
woman
by
the
blood
of
your
covenant
I
will
send
your
prisoners
out
of
the
waterless
pit
12
Return
to
the
stronghold
you
prisoners
with
hope
Today
I
am
telling
you
I
will
repay
to
you
O
woman
a
double
portion
13
For
I
will
bend
Judah
as
my
bow
The
bow
I
will
fill
with
Ephraim
And
I
will
awaken
your
sons
O
Zion
Against
your
sons
O
Greece
And
I
will
make
you
like
a
warriors
sword
14
Jehovah
will
be
seen
over
them
And
his
arrow
will
go
out
like
lightning
The
Sovereign
Lord
Jehovah
will
sound
the
horn
And
he
will
advance
with
the
windstorms
of
the
south
15
Jehovah
of
armies
will
defend
them
And
they
will
devour
and
subdue
the
slingstones
They
will
drink
and
be
boisterous
as
if
with
wine
And
they
will
be
filled
like
the
bowl
Like
the
corners
of
the
altar
16
Jehovah
their
God
will
save
them
in
that
dayAs
the
flock
of
his
people
For
they
will
be
like
the
gemstones
of
a
crown
glittering
over
his
soil
17
For
how
great
his
goodness
is
And
how
great
his
handsomeness
is
Grain
will
make
the
young
men
thrive
And
new
wine
the
virgins
1
Ask
Jehovah
for
rain
in
the
time
of
the
spring
rain
It
is
Jehovah
who
makes
the
storm
clouds
Who
pours
rain
for
them
And
gives
vegetation
in
the
field
to
everyone

2
For
the
teraphim
statues
have
spoken
deception
And
the
diviners
have
visioned
a
lie
They
speak
about
worthless
dreams
And
in
vain
they
try
to
comfort
That
is
why
they
will
wander
like
sheep
They
will
suffer
for
there
is
no
shepherd

3
Against
the
shepherds
my
anger
burns
And
against
the
oppressive
leaders
I
will
hold
an
accounting
For
Jehovah
of
armies
has
turned
his
attention
to
his
flock
to
the
house
of
Judah
And
he
has
made
them
like
his
majestic
horse
in
the
battle

4
From
him
comes
the
keyman
From
him
comes
the
supporting
ruler
From
him
comes
the
battle
bow
From
him
goes
forth
every
overseer
all
of
them
together

5
And
they
will
become
like
warriors
Trampling
down
the
mud
of
the
streets
in
the
battle
They
will
wage
war
for
Jehovah
is
with
them
And
the
riders
of
horses
will
be
put
to
shame

6
I
will
make
the
house
of
Judah
superior
And
the
house
of
Joseph
I
will
save
I
will
restore
them
For
I
will
show
them
mercy
And
they
will
be
as
though
I
had
never
cast
them
off
For
I
am
Jehovah
their
God
and
I
will
answer
them

7
Those
of
Ephraim
must
become
like
a
mighty
warrior
And
their
heart
will
rejoice
as
though
from
wine
Their
sons
will
see
this
and
rejoice
Their
heart
will
be
joyful
in
Jehovah

8
I
will
whistle
for
them
and
gather
them
together
For
I
will
redeem
them
and
they
will
become
many
And
continue
to
be
many

9
Though
I
scatter
them
like
seed
among
the
peoples
They
will
remember
me
in
the
distant
places
With
their
sons
they
will
revive
and
return
10
I
will
bring
them
back
from
the
land
of
EgyptAnd
gather
them
from
Assyria
I
will
bring
them
to
the
land
of
Gilead
and
Lebanon
And
there
will
be
no
more
room
for
them
11
He
must
pass
through
the
sea
with
distress
And
in
the
sea
he
will
strike
down
the
waves
All
the
depths
of
the
Nile
will
dry
up
The
pride
of
Assyria
will
be
brought
down
And
the
scepter
of
Egypt
will
depart
12
I
will
make
them
superior
in
Jehovah
And
they
will
walk
about
in
his
name

declares
Jehovah
1
Open
your
doors
O
Lebanon
So
that
a
fire
may
consume
your
cedars

2
Wail
you
juniper
for
the
cedar
has
fallen
The
majestic
trees
have
been
destroyed
Wail
you
oaks
of
Bashan
For
the
dense
forest
has
come
down

3
Listen
The
wailing
of
shepherds
For
their
majesty
has
been
devastated
Listen
The
roaring
of
young
lions
For
the
dense
thickets
along
the
Jordan
have
been
destroyed
4
This
is
what
Jehovah
my
God
says
Shepherd
the
flock
meant
for
the
slaughter
5
whose
buyers
slaughtered
them
and
are
not
held
guilty
And
those
who
sell
them
say
May
Jehovah
be
praised
for
I
will
become
rich
And
their
shepherds
have
no
compassion
for
them
6
For
I
will
no
longer
show
compassion
on
the
inhabitants
of
the
land

declares
Jehovah
So
I
will
cause
each
man
to
fall
into
the
hand
of
his
neighbor
and
his
king
and
they
will
crush
the
land
and
I
will
not
rescue
them
out
of
their
hand
7
And
I
began
to
shepherd
the
flock
meant
for
slaughter
in
your
behalf
O
afflicted
ones
of
the
flock
So
I
took
two
staffs
and
I
called
one
Pleasantness
and
the
other
Union
and
I
began
to
shepherd
the
flock
8
And
I
dismissed
three
shepherds
in
one
month
for
I
became
impatient
with
them
and
they
detested
me
as
well
9
And
I
said
I
will
not
keep
shepherding
you
Let
the
one
who
is
dying
die
and
let
the
one
perishing
perish
As
for
those
who
are
left
let
them
devour
one
anothers
flesh
10
So
I
took
my
staff
Pleasantness
and
cut
it
up
breaking
my
covenant
that
I
had
made
with
all
the
peoples
11
So
it
was
broken
in
that
day
and
the
afflicted
ones
of
the
flock
who
were
watching
me
knew
that
it
was
the
word
of
Jehovah
12
Then
I
said
to
them
If
it
seems
good
to
you
give
me
my
wages
but
if
not
withhold
them
And
they
paid
my
wages
30
pieces
of
silver
13
Then
Jehovah
said
to
me
Throw
it
into
the
treasury—the
magnificent
value
with
which
they
valued
me
So
I
took
the
30
pieces
of
silver
and
threw
it
into
the
treasury
at
the
house
of
Jehovah
14
Then
I
cut
up
my
second
staff
the
Union
breaking
the
brotherhood
between
Judah
and
Israel
15
And
Jehovah
said
to
me
Now
take
the
equipment
of
a
useless
shepherd
16
For
I
am
letting
a
shepherd
rise
up
in
the
land
He
will
not
take
care
of
the
sheep
that
are
perishing
he
will
not
seek
out
the
young
or
heal
the
injured
or
feed
those
able
to
stand
Instead
he
devours
the
flesh
of
the
fat
one
and
tears
off
the
hooves
of
the
sheep
17
Woe
to
my
worthless
shepherd
who
is
abandoning
the
flock
A
sword
will
strike
his
arm
and
his
right
eye
His
arm
will
wither
completely
And
his
right
eye
will
go
completely
blind
1
A
pronouncement
The
word
of
Jehovah
concerning
Israel

declares
Jehovah
The
One
who
stretched
out
the
heavens
Who
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
And
who
formed
the
spirit
of
man
within
him
2
Here
I
am
making
Jerusalem
a
cup
that
causes
all
the
surrounding
peoples
to
stagger
and
there
will
be
a
siege
against
Judah
as
well
as
against
Jerusalem
3
In
that
day
I
will
make
Jerusalem
a
heavy
stone
to
all
the
peoples
All
those
who
lift
it
are
sure
to
be
severely
injured
and
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
will
be
gathered
against
her
4
In
that
day

declares
Jehovah
I
will
strike
every
horse
with
panic
and
its
rider
with
madness
I
will
keep
my
eyes
on
the
house
of
Judah
but
I
will
strike
every
horse
of
the
peoples
with
blindness
5
And
the
sheikhs
of
Judah
will
say
in
their
heart
The
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
are
a
strength
to
me
by
means
of
Jehovah
of
armies
their
God
6
In
that
day
I
will
make
the
sheikhs
of
Judah
like
a
fiery
pot
among
wood
and
like
a
fiery
torch
in
a
row
of
cut
grain
and
they
will
consume
all
the
surrounding
peoples
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
and
Jerusalem
will
again
be
inhabited
in
her
place
in
Jerusalem
7
And
Jehovah
will
save
the
tents
of
Judah
first
so
that
the
beauty
of
the
house
of
David
and
the
beauty
of
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
may
not
be
too
great
over
Judah
8
In
that
day
Jehovah
will
be
a
defense
around
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
in
that
day
the
one
who
stumbles
among
them
will
be
like
David
and
the
house
of
David
like
God
like
Jehovahs
angel
who
goes
before
them
9
And
in
that
day
I
will
be
certain
to
annihilate
all
the
nations
that
come
against
Jerusalem
10
I
will
pour
out
on
the
house
of
David
and
on
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
the
spirit
of
favor
and
supplication
and
they
will
look
to
the
one
whom
they
pierced
and
they
will
wail
over
him
as
they
would
wail
over
an
only
son
and
they
will
grieve
bitterly
over
him
as
they
would
grieve
over
a
firstborn
son
11
In
that
day
the
wailing
in
Jerusalem
will
be
great
like
the
wailing
at
Hadadrimmon
in
the
Plain
of
Megiddo
12
And
the
land
will
wail
each
family
by
itself
the
family
of
Davids
house
by
itself
and
their
women
by
themselves
the
family
of
Nathans
house
by
itself
and
their
women
by
themselves
13
the
family
of
Levis
house
by
itself
and
their
women
by
themselves
the
family
of
the
Shimeites
by
itself
and
their
women
by
themselves
14
and
all
the
families
that
are
left
remaining
each
family
by
itself
and
their
women
by
themselves
1
In
that
day
a
well
will
be
opened
to
the
house
of
David
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
for
cleansing
sin
and
impurity
2
In
that
day

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
I
will
erase
the
names
of
the
idols
from
the
land
and
they
will
no
longer
be
remembered
and
I
will
rid
the
land
of
the
prophets
and
the
spirit
of
uncleanness
3
And
if
a
man
should
prophesy
again
his
father
and
his
mother
who
caused
his
birth
will
say
to
him
You
will
not
live
because
you
have
spoken
lies
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
And
his
father
and
his
mother
who
caused
his
birth
will
pierce
him
through
because
of
his
prophesying
4
In
that
day
each
of
the
prophets
will
be
ashamed
of
his
vision
when
he
prophesies
and
they
will
not
wear
an
official
garment
of
hair
in
order
to
deceive
5
And
he
will
say
I
am
no
prophet
I
am
a
man
cultivating
the
soil
because
a
man
bought
me
when
I
was
young
6
And
if
someone
asks
him
What
are
these
wounds
between
your
shoulders
he
will
answer
Wounds
I
received
in
the
house
of
my
friends

7
O
sword
awake
against
my
shepherd
Against
the
man
who
is
my
companion

declares
Jehovah
of
armies
Strike
the
shepherd
and
let
the
flock
be
scattered
And
I
will
turn
my
hand
against
those
who
are
insignificant

8
And
in
all
the
land

declares
Jehovah
Two
parts
in
it
will
be
cut
off
and
perish
And
the
third
part
will
be
left
remaining
in
it

9
And
I
will
bring
the
third
part
through
the
fire
And
I
will
refine
them
as
silver
is
refined
And
test
them
as
gold
is
tested
They
will
call
on
my
name
And
I
will
answer
them
I
will
say
They
are
my
people

And
they
will
say
Jehovah
is
our
God
1
Look
The
day
is
coming
a
day
belonging
to
Jehovah
when
the
spoil
from
you
will
be
divided
in
your
midst
2
I
will
gather
all
the
nations
against
Jerusalem
for
the
war
and
the
city
will
be
captured
and
the
houses
plundered
and
the
women
raped
And
half
of
the
city
will
go
into
exile
but
the
remaining
ones
of
the
people
will
not
be
cut
off
from
the
city
3
Jehovah
will
go
out
and
war
against
those
nations
as
when
he
fights
in
the
day
of
a
battle
4
In
that
day
his
feet
will
stand
on
the
Mount
of
Olives
which
faces
Jerusalem
on
the
east
and
the
Mount
of
Olives
will
be
split
in
half
from
east
to
west
forming
a
very
great
valley
and
half
of
the
mountain
will
move
to
the
north
and
half
of
it
to
the
south
5
You
will
flee
to
the
valley
of
my
mountains
for
the
valley
of
the
mountains
will
extend
all
the
way
to
Azel
You
will
have
to
flee
just
as
you
fled
because
of
the
earthquake
in
the
days
of
King
Uzziah
of
Judah
And
Jehovah
my
God
will
come
and
all
the
holy
ones
will
be
with
him
6
In
that
day
there
will
be
no
precious
light—things
will
be
congealed
7
And
it
will
become
one
day
that
is
known
as
belonging
to
Jehovah
It
will
not
be
day
nor
will
it
be
night
and
at
evening
time
there
will
be
light
8
In
that
day
living
waters
will
flow
out
from
Jerusalem
half
of
them
toward
the
eastern
sea
and
half
of
them
toward
the
western
sea
It
will
happen
in
summer
and
in
winter
9
And
Jehovah
will
be
King
over
all
the
earth
In
that
day
Jehovah
will
be
one
and
his
name
one
10
The
whole
land
will
become
like
the
Arabah
from
Geba
to
Rimmon
south
of
Jerusalem
and
she
will
rise
and
be
inhabited
in
her
place
from
the
Gate
of
Benjamin
all
the
way
to
the
site
of
the
First
Gate
all
the
way
to
the
Corner
Gate
and
from
the
Tower
of
Hananel
all
the
way
to
the
winepresses
of
the
king
11
And
people
will
inhabit
her
and
there
will
never
again
be
a
curse
of
destruction
and
Jerusalem
will
be
inhabited
in
security
12
And
this
is
the
scourge
with
which
Jehovah
will
scourge
all
the
peoples
who
wage
war
against
Jerusalem
Their
flesh
will
rot
away
while
they
stand
on
their
feet
their
eyes
will
rot
away
in
their
sockets
and
their
tongues
will
rot
away
in
their
mouths
13
In
that
day
confusion
from
Jehovah
will
be
widespread
among
them
and
each
one
will
grab
hold
of
the
hand
of
his
companion
and
his
hand
will
come
against
the
hand
of
his
companion
14
Judah
will
also
be
involved
in
the
war
at
Jerusalem
and
the
wealth
of
all
the
surrounding
nations
will
be
gathered
gold
and
silver
and
garments
in
vast
quantity
15
And
a
scourge
like
that
scourge
will
also
come
against
the
horses
the
mules
the
camels
the
donkeys
and
all
the
livestock
that
are
in
those
camps
16
Everyone
who
is
left
remaining
out
of
all
the
nations
that
come
against
Jerusalem
will
go
up
from
year
to
year
to
bow
down
to
the
King
Jehovah
of
armies
and
to
celebrate
the
Festival
of
Booths
17
But
if
anyone
among
the
families
of
the
earth
does
not
go
up
to
Jerusalem
to
bow
down
to
the
King
Jehovah
of
armies
no
rain
will
fall
on
them
18
And
if
the
family
of
Egypt
does
not
come
up
and
does
not
come
in
they
will
have
no
rain
Instead
they
will
have
the
scourge
with
which
Jehovah
scourges
the
nations
that
do
not
come
up
to
celebrate
the
Festival
of
Booths
19
This
will
be
the
punishment
for
the
sin
of
Egypt
and
the
sin
of
all
the
nations
that
do
not
come
up
to
celebrate
the
Festival
of
Booths
20
In
that
day
the
words
Holiness
belongs
to
Jehovah
will
be
written
on
the
bells
of
the
horses
And
the
cooking
pots
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
will
be
like
the
bowls
before
the
altar
21
And
every
cooking
pot
in
Jerusalem
and
in
Judah
will
be
holy
and
will
belong
to
Jehovah
of
armies
and
all
those
who
are
sacrificing
will
come
in
and
use
some
of
them
for
boiling
In
that
day
there
will
no
longer
be
a
Canaanite
in
the
house
of
Jehovah
of
armies
1
A
pronouncement
The
word
of
Jehovah
to
Israel
through
Malachi
2
I
have
shown
love
to
you
people

says
Jehovah
But
you
say
How
have
you
shown
us
love
Was
not
Esau
the
brother
of
Jacob
declares
Jehovah
But
I
loved
Jacob
3
and
Esau
I
hated
and
I
made
his
mountains
desolate
and
left
his
inheritance
for
the
jackals
of
the
wilderness
4
Though
Edom
says
We
have
been
shattered
but
we
will
return
and
rebuild
the
ruins

this
is
what
Jehovah
of
armies
says
They
will
build
but
I
will
tear
down
and
they
will
be
called
the
territory
of
wickedness
and
the
people
whom
Jehovah
has
forever
condemned
5
Your
own
eyes
will
see
it
and
you
will
say
May
Jehovah
be
magnified
over
the
territory
of
Israel
6
A
son
honors
a
father
and
a
servant
his
master
So
if
I
am
a
father
where
is
the
honor
due
me
And
if
I
am
a
master
where
is
the
fear
due
me
Jehovah
of
armies
says
to
you
priests
who
are
despising
my
name
But
you
say
How
have
we
despised
your
name
7
By
presenting
polluted
food
on
my
altar
And
you
say
How
have
we
polluted
you
By
saying
The
table
of
Jehovah
is
something
to
be
despised
8
And
when
you
present
a
blind
animal
as
a
sacrifice
you
say
It
is
nothing
bad
And
when
you
present
a
lame
animal
or
a
sick
one
It
is
nothing
bad
Try
presenting
them
please
to
your
governor
Will
he
be
pleased
with
you
or
receive
you
with
favor
says
Jehovah
of
armies
9
And
now
please
appeal
to
God
that
he
may
show
us
favor
With
such
offerings
from
your
own
hand
will
he
receive
any
of
you
with
favor
says
Jehovah
of
armies
10
And
who
among
you
is
willing
to
shut
the
doors
For
you
will
not
even
light
my
altar
without
charge
I
find
no
delight
in
you

says
Jehovah
of
armies
and
I
take
no
pleasure
in
any
gift
offering
from
your
hand
11
For
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
to
its
setting
my
name
will
be
great
among
the
nations
In
every
place
sacrifices
will
be
made
to
smoke
and
offerings
will
be
made
to
my
name
as
a
pure
gift
because
my
name
will
be
great
among
the
nations

says
Jehovah
of
armies
12
But
you
are
profaning
it
by
saying
The
table
of
Jehovah
is
polluted
and
its
fruit
its
food
is
to
be
despised
13
You
also
say
Look
How
tiresome
and
you
sniff
scornfully
at
it

says
Jehovah
of
armies
And
you
bring
stolen
lame
and
sick
animals
Yes
you
bring
such
things
as
a
gift
Should
I
accept
it
from
your
hand
says
Jehovah
14
Cursed
is
the
cunning
one
who
has
a
sound
male
animal
in
his
flock
but
he
makes
a
vow
and
sacrifices
a
blemished
one
to
Jehovah
For
I
am
a
great
King

says
Jehovah
of
armies
and
my
name
will
be
awe-inspiring
among
the
nations
1
And
now
O
priests
this
commandment
is
for
you
2
If
you
refuse
to
listen
and
to
take
it
to
heart
to
glorify
my
name

says
Jehovah
of
armies
I
will
send
on
you
the
curse
and
I
will
turn
your
blessings
into
curses
Yes
I
have
turned
the
blessings
into
curses
because
you
are
not
taking
it
to
heart
3
Look
I
will
ruin
your
sown
seed
because
of
you
and
I
will
scatter
dung
on
your
faces
the
dung
of
your
festivals
and
you
will
be
carried
away
to
it
4
Then
you
will
know
that
I
have
given
this
commandment
to
you
so
that
my
covenant
with
Levi
may
continue

says
Jehovah
of
armies
5
My
covenant
with
him
was
one
of
life
and
of
peace
which
I
gave
to
him
along
with
fear
He
feared
me
yes
he
stood
in
awe
of
my
name
6
The
law
of
truth
was
in
his
mouth
and
no
unrighteousness
was
found
on
his
lips
He
walked
with
me
in
peace
and
in
uprightness
and
he
turned
many
back
from
error
7
For
the
lips
of
a
priest
should
safeguard
knowledge
and
people
should
seek
the
law
from
his
mouth
because
he
is
the
messenger
of
Jehovah
of
armies
8
But
you
yourselves
have
turned
aside
from
the
way
You
have
made
many
stumble
with
regard
to
the
law
You
have
ruined
the
covenant
of
Levi

says
Jehovah
of
armies
9
So
I
will
make
you
despised
and
low
before
all
the
people
because
you
did
not
keep
my
ways
but
showed
partiality
in
applying
the
law
10
Do
we
not
all
have
one
father
Was
it
not
one
God
who
created
us
So
why
do
we
deal
treacherously
with
one
another
profaning
the
covenant
of
our
forefathers
11
Judah
has
dealt
treacherously
and
something
detestable
has
been
done
in
Israel
and
in
Jerusalem
for
Judah
has
profaned
the
holiness
of
Jehovah
which
He
loves
and
he
has
taken
as
a
bride
the
daughter
of
a
foreign
god
12
Jehovah
will
cut
off
from
the
tents
of
Jacob
anyone
who
does
this
whoever
he
may
be
though
he
presents
a
gift
offering
to
Jehovah
of
armies
13
And
there
is
another
thing
that
you
do
which
results
in
covering
the
altar
of
Jehovah
with
tears
and
with
weeping
and
sighing
so
that
he
no
longer
pays
attention
to
your
gift
offering
or
looks
favorably
on
anything
from
your
hand
14
And
you
say
For
what
reason
It
is
because
Jehovah
has
acted
as
a
witness
between
you
and
the
wife
of
your
youth
with
whom
you
have
dealt
treacherously
although
she
is
your
partner
and
your
wife
by
covenant
15
But
there
was
one
who
did
not
do
it
for
he
had
what
remained
of
the
spirit
And
what
was
that
one
seeking
The
offspring
of
God
So
guard
yourselves
respecting
your
spirit
and
do
not
deal
treacherously
with
the
wife
of
your
youth
16
For
I
hate
divorce

says
Jehovah
the
God
of
Israel
and
the
one
who
covers
his
garment
with
violence

says
Jehovah
of
armies
And
guard
yourselves
respecting
your
spirit
and
you
must
not
deal
treacherously
17
You
have
made
Jehovah
weary
with
your
words
But
you
say
How
have
we
made
him
weary
By
saying
Everyone
who
does
bad
is
good
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
he
finds
pleasure
in
him

or
by
saying
Where
is
the
God
of
justice
1
Look
I
am
sending
my
messenger
and
he
will
clear
up
a
way
before
me
And
suddenly
the
true
Lord
whom
you
are
seeking
will
come
to
his
temple
and
the
messenger
of
the
covenant
will
come
in
whom
you
take
delight
Look
He
will
certainly
come

says
Jehovah
of
armies
2
But
who
will
endure
the
day
of
his
coming
and
who
will
be
able
to
stand
when
he
appears
For
he
will
be
like
the
fire
of
a
refiner
and
like
the
lye
of
laundrymen
3
And
he
will
sit
as
a
refiner
and
cleanser
of
silver
and
will
cleanse
the
sons
of
Levi
and
he
will
clarify
them
like
gold
and
like
silver
and
they
will
certainly
become
to
Jehovah
people
presenting
a
gift
offering
in
righteousness
4
And
the
gift
offering
of
Judah
and
of
Jerusalem
will
actually
be
pleasing
to
Jehovah
as
in
the
days
of
long
ago
and
as
in
the
years
of
antiquity
5
I
will
come
near
to
you
for
judgment
and
I
will
be
a
swift
witness
against
the
sorcerers
against
the
adulterers
against
those
who
take
false
oaths
against
those
who
defraud
the
hired
worker
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
child
and
against
those
who
refuse
to
help
the
foreigner
These
have
not
feared
me

says
Jehovah
of
armies
6
For
I
am
Jehovah
I
do
not
change
And
you
are
sons
of
Jacob
you
have
not
yet
come
to
your
finish
7
From
the
days
of
your
forefathers
you
have
turned
aside
from
my
regulations
and
have
not
kept
them
Return
to
me
and
I
will
return
to
you

says
Jehovah
of
armies
But
you
say
How
are
we
supposed
to
return
8
Will
a
mere
human
rob
God
But
you
are
robbing
me
And
you
say
How
have
we
robbed
you
In
the
tithes
and
in
the
contributions
9
You
are
certainly
cursed
for
you
are
robbing
me—yes
the
entire
nation
is
doing
so
10
Bring
the
entire
tithe
into
the
storehouse
so
that
there
may
be
food
in
my
house
and
test
me
out
please
in
this
regard

Jehovah
of
armies
says
to
see
whether
I
will
not
open
to
you
the
floodgates
of
the
heavens
and
pour
out
on
you
a
blessing
until
there
is
nothing
lacking
11
And
I
will
rebuke
the
devouring
one
for
you
and
it
will
not
ruin
the
fruit
of
your
land
nor
will
the
vine
in
your
field
be
fruitless

says
Jehovah
of
armies
12
All
the
nations
will
have
to
declare
you
happy
for
you
will
become
a
land
of
delight

says
Jehovah
of
armies
13
Your
words
against
me
have
been
strong

says
Jehovah
And
you
say
How
have
we
spoken
against
you
among
ourselves
14
You
say
It
is
of
no
value
to
serve
God
How
have
we
benefited
by
keeping
our
obligations
to
him
and
by
walking
somberly
before
Jehovah
of
armies
15
Now
we
consider
presumptuous
people
happy
Also
those
who
practice
wickedness
are
successful
They
dare
to
put
God
to
the
test
and
get
away
with
it
16
At
that
time
those
who
fear
Jehovah
spoke
with
one
another
each
one
with
his
companion
and
Jehovah
kept
paying
attention
and
listening
And
a
book
of
remembrance
was
written
before
him
for
those
fearing
Jehovah
and
for
those
meditating
on
his
name
17
And
they
will
be
mine

says
Jehovah
of
armies
in
the
day
when
I
produce
a
special
property
I
will
show
them
compassion
just
as
a
man
shows
compassion
to
his
son
who
serves
him
18
And
you
will
again
see
the
distinction
between
a
righteous
person
and
a
wicked
person
between
one
serving
God
and
one
not
serving
him
1
For
look
the
day
is
coming
burning
like
a
furnace
when
all
the
presumptuous
ones
and
all
those
practicing
wickedness
will
become
like
stubble
The
coming
day
will
certainly
devour
them

says
Jehovah
of
armies
and
it
will
leave
them
neither
root
nor
branch
2
But
on
you
who
honor
my
name
the
sun
of
righteousness
will
shine
with
healing
in
its
rays
and
you
will
skip
about
like
fattened
calves
3
And
you
will
tread
the
wicked
underfoot
for
they
will
be
like
dust
under
the
soles
of
your
feet
on
the
day
when
I
take
action

says
Jehovah
of
armies
4
Remember
the
Law
of
my
servant
Moses
the
regulations
and
judgments
that
I
commanded
at
Horeb
for
all
Israel
to
obey
5
Look
I
am
sending
to
you
Elijah
the
prophet
before
the
coming
of
the
great
and
awe-inspiring
day
of
Jehovah
6
And
he
will
turn
the
hearts
of
fathers
back
toward
sons
and
the
hearts
of
sons
back
toward
fathers
so
that
I
may
not
come
and
strike
the
earth
devoting
it
to
destruction

to

the

of

who
is
called

17
All
the
generations
then
from
Abraham
until
David
were
14
generations
from
David
until
the
deportation
to
Babylon
14
generations
from
the
deportation
to
Babylon
until
the
Christ
14
generations
18
But
this
is
how
the
birth
of
Jesus
Christ
took
place
During
the
time
his
mother
Mary
was
promised
in
marriage
to
Joseph
she
was
found
to
be
pregnant
by
holy
spirit
before
they
were
united
19
However
because
her
husband
Joseph
was
righteous
and
did
not
want
to
make
her
a
public
spectacle
he
intended
to
divorce
her
secretly
20
But
after
he
had
thought
these
things
over
look
Jehovahs
angel
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
saying
Joseph
son
of
David
do
not
be
afraid
to
take
your
wife
Mary
home
for
what
has
been
conceived
in
her
is
by
holy
spirit
21
She
will
give
birth
to
a
son
and
you
are
to
name
him
Jesus
for
he
will
save
his
people
from
their
sins
22
All
of
this
actually
came
about
to
fulfill
what
was
spoken
by
Jehovah
through
his
prophet
saying
23
Look
The
virgin
will
become
pregnant
and
will
give
birth
to
a
son
and
they
will
name
him
Immanuel

which
means
when
translated
With
Us
Is
God
24
Then
Joseph
woke
up
from
his
sleep
and
did
as
the
angel
of
Jehovah
had
directed
him
and
he
took
his
wife
home
25
But
he
did
not
have
sexual
relations
with
her
until
she
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
he
named
him
Jesus
1
After
Jesus
had
been
born
in
Bethlehem
of
Judea
in
the
days
of
Herod
the
king
look
astrologers
from
the
East
came
to
Jerusalem
2
saying
Where
is
the
one
born
king
of
the
Jews
For
we
saw
his
star
when
we
were
in
the
East
and
we
have
come
to
do
obeisance
to
him
3
At
hearing
this
King
Herod
was
agitated
and
all
Jerusalem
with
him
4
On
gathering
together
all
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
of
the
people
he
inquired
of
them
where
the
Christ
was
to
be
born
5
They
said
to
him
In
Bethlehem
of
Judea
for
this
is
how
it
has
been
written
through
the
prophet
6
And
you
O
Bethlehem
of
the
land
of
Judah
are
by
no
means
the
most
insignificant
city
among
the
governors
of
Judah
for
out
of
you
will
come
a
governing
one
who
will
shepherd
my
people
Israel
7
Then
Herod
secretly
summoned
the
astrologers
and
carefully
ascertained
from
them
the
time
of
the
stars
appearing
8
When
sending
them
to
Bethlehem
he
said
Go
make
a
careful
search
for
the
young
child
and
when
you
have
found
him
report
back
to
me
so
that
I
too
may
go
and
do
obeisance
to
him
9
After
they
had
heard
the
king
they
went
their
way
and
look
the
star
they
had
seen
when
they
were
in
the
East
went
ahead
of
them
until
it
came
to
a
stop
above
where
the
young
child
was
10
On
seeing
the
star
they
rejoiced
with
great
joy
11
And
when
they
went
into
the
house
they
saw
the
young
child
with
Mary
his
mother
and
falling
down
they
did
obeisance
to
him
They
also
opened
their
treasures
and
presented
him
with
gifts—gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh
12
However
because
they
were
given
divine
warning
in
a
dream
not
to
return
to
Herod
they
departed
for
their
country
by
another
way
13
After
they
had
departed
look
Jehovahs
angel
appeared
to
Joseph
in
a
dream
saying
Get
up
take
the
young
child
and
his
mother
and
flee
to
Egypt
and
stay
there
until
I
give
you
word
for
Herod
is
about
to
search
for
the
young
child
to
kill
him
14
So
Joseph
got
up
and
by
night
took
along
the
young
child
and
the
childs
mother
and
went
into
Egypt
15
He
stayed
there
until
the
death
of
Herod
This
fulfilled
what
was
spoken
by
Jehovah
through
his
prophet
saying
Out
of
Egypt
I
called
my
son
16
Then
Herod
seeing
that
he
had
been
outwitted
by
the
astrologers
flew
into
a
great
rage
and
he
sent
out
and
had
all
the
boys
in
Bethlehem
and
in
all
its
districts
killed
from
two
years
of
age
and
under
according
to
the
time
that
he
had
carefully
ascertained
from
the
astrologers
17
Then
was
fulfilled
what
was
spoken
through
Jeremiah
the
prophet
who
said
18
A
voice
was
heard
in
Ramah
weeping
and
much
wailing
It
was
Rachel
weeping
for
her
children
and
she
was
unwilling
to
take
comfort
because
they
are
no
more
19
When
Herod
had
died
look
Jehovahs
angel
appeared
in
a
dream
to
Joseph
in
Egypt
20
and
said
Get
up
take
the
young
child
and
his
mother
and
go
into
the
land
of
Israel
for
those
who
were
seeking
the
life
of
the
young
child
are
dead
21
So
he
got
up
and
took
the
young
child
and
the
childs
mother
and
entered
into
the
land
of
Israel
22
But
hearing
that
Archelaus
ruled
Judea
instead
of
his
father
Herod
he
was
afraid
to
go
there
Moreover
being
given
divine
warning
in
a
dream
he
withdrew
into
the
territory
of
Galilee
23
And
he
came
and
settled
in
a
city
named
Nazareth
in
order
to
fulfill
what
was
spoken
through
the
prophets
He
will
be
called
a
Nazarene
1
In
those
days
John
the
Baptist
came
preaching
in
the
wilderness
of
Judea
2
saying
Repent
for
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
has
drawn
near
3
This
in
fact
is
the
one
spoken
of
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
in
these
words
A
voice
of
one
calling
out
in
the
wilderness
Prepare
the
way
of
Jehovah
Make
his
roads
straight
4
Now
John
was
clothed
with
camels
hair
and
had
a
leather
belt
around
his
waist
His
food
was
locusts
and
wild
honey
5
Then
the
people
of
Jerusalem
and
all
Judea
and
all
the
country
around
the
Jordan
were
going
out
to
him
6
and
they
were
baptized
by
him
in
the
Jordan
River
openly
confessing
their
sins
7
When
he
caught
sight
of
many
of
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
coming
to
the
baptism
he
said
to
them
You
offspring
of
vipers
who
has
warned
you
to
flee
from
the
coming
wrath
8
Therefore
produce
fruit
that
befits
repentance
9
Do
not
presume
to
say
to
yourselves
We
have
Abraham
as
our
father
For
I
say
to
you
that
God
is
able
to
raise
up
children
for
Abraham
from
these
stones
10
The
ax
is
already
lying
at
the
root
of
the
trees
Every
tree
then
that
does
not
produce
fine
fruit
is
to
be
cut
down
and
thrown
into
the
fire
11
I
for
my
part
baptize
you
with
water
because
of
your
repentance
but
the
one
coming
after
me
is
stronger
than
I
am
whose
sandals
I
am
not
worthy
to
take
off
That
one
will
baptize
you
with
holy
spirit
and
with
fire
12
His
winnowing
shovel
is
in
his
hand
and
he
will
clean
up
his
threshing
floor
completely
and
will
gather
his
wheat
into
the
storehouse
but
the
chaff
he
will
burn
up
with
fire
that
cannot
be
put
out
13
Then
Jesus
came
from
Galilee
to
the
Jordan
to
John
in
order
to
be
baptized
by
him
14
But
the
latter
tried
to
prevent
him
saying
I
am
the
one
who
needs
to
be
baptized
by
you
and
are
you
coming
to
me
15
Jesus
replied
to
him
Let
it
be
this
time
for
in
that
way
it
is
suitable
for
us
to
carry
out
all
that
is
righteous
Then
he
quit
preventing
him
16
After
being
baptized
Jesus
immediately
came
up
from
the
water
and
look
the
heavens
were
opened
up
and
he
saw
Gods
spirit
descending
like
a
dove
and
coming
upon
him
17
Look
Also
a
voice
from
the
heavens
said
This
is
my
Son
the
beloved
whom
I
have
approved
1
Then
Jesus
was
led
by
the
spirit
up
into
the
wilderness
to
be
tempted
by
the
Devil
2
After
he
had
fasted
for
40
days
and
40
nights
he
felt
hungry
3
And
the
Tempter
approached
and
said
to
him
If
you
are
a
son
of
God
tell
these
stones
to
become
loaves
of
bread
4
But
he
answered
It
is
written
Man
must
live
not
on
bread
alone
but
on
every
word
that
comes
from
Jehovahs
mouth
5
Then
the
Devil
took
him
along
into
the
holy
city
and
he
stationed
him
on
the
battlement
of
the
temple
6
and
said
to
him
If
you
are
a
son
of
God
throw
yourself
down
for
it
is
written
He
will
give
his
angels
a
command
concerning
you

and
They
will
carry
you
on
their
hands
so
that
you
may
not
strike
your
foot
against
a
stone
7
Jesus
said
to
him
Again
it
is
written
You
must
not
put
Jehovah
your
God
to
the
test
8
Again
the
Devil
took
him
along
to
an
unusually
high
mountain
and
showed
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
their
glory
9
And
he
said
to
him
All
these
things
I
will
give
you
if
you
fall
down
and
do
an
act
of
worship
to
me
10
Then
Jesus
said
to
him
Go
away
Satan
For
it
is
written
It
is
Jehovah
your
God
you
must
worship
and
it
is
to
him
alone
you
must
render
sacred
service
11
Then
the
Devil
left
him
and
look
angels
came
and
began
to
minister
to
him
12
Now
when
he
heard
that
John
had
been
arrested
he
withdrew
into
Galilee
13
Further
after
leaving
Nazareth
he
came
and
took
up
residence
in
Capernaum
beside
the
sea
in
the
districts
of
Zebulun
and
Naphtali
14
so
as
to
fulfill
what
was
spoken
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
who
said
15
O
land
of
Zebulun
and
land
of
Naphtali
along
the
road
of
the
sea
on
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
Galilee
of
the
nations
16
The
people
sitting
in
darkness
saw
a
great
light
and
as
for
those
sitting
in
a
region
of
deathly
shadow
light
rose
on
them
17
From
that
time
on
Jesus
began
preaching
and
saying
Repent
for
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
has
drawn
near
18
Walking
alongside
the
Sea
of
Galilee
he
saw
two
brothers
Simon
who
is
called
Peter
and
Andrew
his
brother
casting
a
net
into
the
sea
for
they
were
fishermen
19
And
he
said
to
them
Come
after
me
and
I
will
make
you
fishers
of
men
20
At
once
they
abandoned
their
nets
and
followed
him
21
Going
on
from
there
he
saw
two
others
who
were
brothers
James
the
son
of
Zebedee
and
his
brother
John
They
were
in
the
boat
with
Zebedee
their
father
mending
their
nets
and
he
called
them
22
At
once
they
left
the
boat
and
their
father
and
followed
him
23
Then
he
went
throughout
the
whole
of
Galilee
teaching
in
their
synagogues
and
preaching
the
good
news
of
the
Kingdom
and
curing
every
sort
of
disease
and
every
sort
of
infirmity
among
the
people
24
And
the
report
about
him
spread
throughout
all
Syria
and
they
brought
him
all
those
who
were
suffering
with
various
diseases
and
torments
those
who
were
demon-possessed
and
epileptic
and
paralyzed
and
he
cured
them
25
Consequently
large
crowds
followed
him
from
Galilee
and
Decapolis
and
Jerusalem
and
Judea
and
from
the
other
side
of
the
Jordan
1
When
he
saw
the
crowds
he
went
up
on
the
mountain
and
after
he
sat
down
his
disciples
came
to
him
2
Then
he
opened
his
mouth
and
began
teaching
them
saying
3
Happy
are
those
conscious
of
their
spiritual
need
since
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
belongs
to
them
4
Happy
are
those
who
mourn
since
they
will
be
comforted
5
Happy
are
the
mild-tempered
since
they
will
inherit
the
earth
6
Happy
are
those
hungering
and
thirsting
for
righteousness
since
they
will
be
filled
7
Happy
are
the
merciful
since
they
will
be
shown
mercy
8
Happy
are
the
pure
in
heart
since
they
will
see
God
9
Happy
are
the
peacemakers
since
they
will
be
called
sons
of
God
10
Happy
are
those
who
have
been
persecuted
for
righteousness
sake
since
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
belongs
to
them
11
Happy
are
you
when
people
reproach
you
and
persecute
you
and
lyingly
say
every
sort
of
wicked
thing
against
you
for
my
sake
12
Rejoice
and
be
overjoyed
since
your
reward
is
great
in
the
heavens
for
in
that
way
they
persecuted
the
prophets
prior
to
you
13
You
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
but
if
the
salt
loses
its
strength
how
will
its
saltiness
be
restored
It
is
no
longer
usable
for
anything
except
to
be
thrown
outside
to
be
trampled
on
by
men
14
You
are
the
light
of
the
world
A
city
cannot
be
hid
when
located
on
a
mountain
15
People
light
a
lamp
and
set
it
not
under
a
basket
but
on
the
lampstand
and
it
shines
on
all
those
in
the
house
16
Likewise
let
your
light
shine
before
men
so
that
they
may
see
your
fine
works
and
give
glory
to
your
Father
who
is
in
the
heavens
17
Do
not
think
I
came
to
destroy
the
Law
or
the
Prophets
I
came
not
to
destroy
but
to
fulfill
18
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
sooner
would
heaven
and
earth
pass
away
than
for
one
smallest
letter
or
one
stroke
of
a
letter
to
pass
away
from
the
Law
until
all
things
take
place
19
Whoever
therefore
breaks
one
of
these
least
commandments
and
teaches
others
to
do
so
will
be
called
least
in
relation
to
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
But
whoever
does
them
and
teaches
them
will
be
called
great
in
relation
to
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
20
For
I
say
to
you
that
if
your
righteousness
does
not
surpass
that
of
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
you
will
by
no
means
enter
into
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
21
You
heard
that
it
was
said
to
those
of
ancient
times
You
must
not
murder
but
whoever
commits
a
murder
will
be
accountable
to
the
court
of
justice
22
However
I
say
to
you
that
everyone
who
continues
wrathful
with
his
brother
will
be
accountable
to
the
court
of
justice
and
whoever
addresses
his
brother
with
an
unspeakable
word
of
contempt
will
be
accountable
to
the
Supreme
Court
whereas
whoever
says
You
despicable
fool
will
be
liable
to
the
fiery
Gehenna
23
If
then
you
are
bringing
your
gift
to
the
altar
and
there
you
remember
that
your
brother
has
something
against
you
24
leave
your
gift
there
in
front
of
the
altar
and
go
away
First
make
your
peace
with
your
brother
and
then
come
back
and
offer
your
gift
25
Be
quick
to
settle
matters
with
your
legal
opponent
while
you
are
with
him
on
the
way
there
so
that
somehow
the
opponent
may
not
turn
you
over
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
to
the
court
attendant
and
you
get
thrown
into
prison
26
I
say
to
you
for
a
fact
you
will
certainly
not
come
out
of
there
until
you
have
paid
over
your
last
small
coin
27
You
heard
that
it
was
said
You
must
not
commit
adultery
28
But
I
say
to
you
that
everyone
who
keeps
on
looking
at
a
woman
so
as
to
have
a
passion
for
her
has
already
committed
adultery
with
her
in
his
heart
29
If
now
your
right
eye
is
making
you
stumble
tear
it
out
and
throw
it
away
from
you
For
it
is
better
for
you
to
lose
one
of
your
members
than
for
your
whole
body
to
be
pitched
into
Gehenna
30
Also
if
your
right
hand
is
making
you
stumble
cut
it
off
and
throw
it
away
from
you
For
it
is
better
for
you
to
lose
one
of
your
members
than
for
your
whole
body
to
land
in
Gehenna
31
Moreover
it
was
said
Whoever
divorces
his
wife
let
him
give
her
a
certificate
of
divorce
32
However
I
say
to
you
that
everyone
divorcing
his
wife
except
on
account
of
sexual
immorality
makes
her
a
subject
for
adultery
and
whoever
marries
a
divorced
woman
commits
adultery
33
Again
you
heard
that
it
was
said
to
those
of
ancient
times
You
must
not
swear
without
performing
but
you
must
pay
your
vows
to
Jehovah
34
However
I
say
to
you
Do
not
swear
at
all
neither
by
heaven
for
it
is
Gods
throne
35
nor
by
earth
for
it
is
the
footstool
of
his
feet
nor
by
Jerusalem
for
it
is
the
city
of
the
great
King
36
Do
not
swear
by
your
head
since
you
cannot
turn
one
hair
white
or
black
37
Just
let
your
word
Yes
mean
yes
your
No

no
for
what
goes
beyond
these
is
from
the
wicked
one
38
You
heard
that
it
was
said
Eye
for
eye
and
tooth
for
tooth
39
However
I
say
to
you
Do
not
resist
the
one
who
is
wicked
but
whoever
slaps
you
on
your
right
cheek
turn
the
other
also
to
him
40
And
if
a
person
wants
to
take
you
to
court
and
get
possession
of
your
inner
garment
let
him
also
have
your
outer
garment
41
and
if
someone
in
authority
compels
you
into
service
for
a
mile
go
with
him
two
miles
42
Give
to
the
one
asking
you
and
do
not
turn
away
from
one
who
wants
to
borrow
from
you
43
You
heard
that
it
was
said
You
must
love
your
neighbor
and
hate
your
enemy
44
However
I
say
to
you
Continue
to
love
your
enemies
and
to
pray
for
those
who
persecute
you
45
so
that
you
may
prove
yourselves
sons
of
your
Father
who
is
in
the
heavens
since
he
makes
his
sun
rise
on
both
the
wicked
and
the
good
and
makes
it
rain
on
both
the
righteous
and
the
unrighteous
46
For
if
you
love
those
loving
you
what
reward
do
you
have
Are
not
also
the
tax
collectors
doing
the
same
thing
47
And
if
you
greet
your
brothers
only
what
extraordinary
thing
are
you
doing
Are
not
also
the
people
of
the
nations
doing
the
same
thing
48
You
must
accordingly
be
perfect
as
your
heavenly
Father
is
perfect
1
Take
care
not
to
practice
your
righteousness
in
front
of
men
to
be
noticed
by
them
otherwise
you
will
have
no
reward
with
your
Father
who
is
in
the
heavens
2
So
when
you
make
gifts
of
mercy
do
not
blow
a
trumpet
ahead
of
you
as
the
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
streets
so
that
they
may
be
glorified
by
men
Truly
I
say
to
you
they
have
their
reward
in
full
3
But
you
when
making
gifts
of
mercy
do
not
let
your
left
hand
know
what
your
right
hand
is
doing
4
so
that
your
gifts
of
mercy
may
be
in
secret
Then
your
Father
who
looks
on
in
secret
will
repay
you
5
Also
when
you
pray
do
not
act
like
the
hypocrites
for
they
like
to
pray
standing
in
the
synagogues
and
on
the
corners
of
the
main
streets
to
be
seen
by
men
Truly
I
say
to
you
they
have
their
reward
in
full
6
But
when
you
pray
go
into
your
private
room
and
after
shutting
your
door
pray
to
your
Father
who
is
in
secret
Then
your
Father
who
looks
on
in
secret
will
repay
you
7
When
praying
do
not
say
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
as
the
people
of
the
nations
do
for
they
imagine
they
will
get
a
hearing
for
their
use
of
many
words
8
So
do
not
be
like
them
for
your
Father
knows
what
you
need
even
before
you
ask
him
9
You
must
pray
then
this
way
Our
Father
in
the
heavens
let
your
name
be
sanctified
10
Let
your
Kingdom
come
Let
your
will
take
place
as
in
heaven
also
on
earth
11
Give
us
today
our
bread
for
this
day
12
and
forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
also
have
forgiven
our
debtors
13
And
do
not
bring
us
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
the
wicked
one
14
For
if
you
forgive
men
their
trespasses
your
heavenly
Father
will
also
forgive
you
15
whereas
if
you
do
not
forgive
men
their
trespasses
neither
will
your
Father
forgive
your
trespasses
16
When
you
fast
stop
becoming
sad-faced
like
the
hypocrites
for
they
disfigure
their
faces
so
they
may
appear
to
men
to
be
fasting
Truly
I
say
to
you
they
have
their
reward
in
full
17
But
you
when
fasting
put
oil
on
your
head
and
wash
your
face
18
so
that
you
may
not
appear
to
be
fasting
to
men
but
only
to
your
Father
who
is
in
secret
Then
your
Father
who
looks
on
in
secret
will
repay
you
19
Stop
storing
up
for
yourselves
treasures
on
the
earth
where
moth
and
rust
consume
and
where
thieves
break
in
and
steal
20
Rather
store
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
consumes
and
where
thieves
do
not
break
in
and
steal
21
For
where
your
treasure
is
there
your
heart
will
be
also
22
The
lamp
of
the
body
is
the
eye
If
then
your
eye
is
focused
your
whole
body
will
be
bright
23
But
if
your
eye
is
envious
your
whole
body
will
be
dark
If
the
light
that
is
in
you
is
really
darkness
how
great
that
darkness
is
24
No
one
can
slave
for
two
masters
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one
and
love
the
other
or
he
will
stick
to
the
one
and
despise
the
other
You
cannot
slave
for
God
and
for
Riches
25
On
this
account
I
say
to
you
Stop
being
anxious
about
your
lives
as
to
what
you
will
eat
or
what
you
will
drink
or
about
your
bodies
as
to
what
you
will
wear
Does
not
life
mean
more
than
food
and
the
body
than
clothing
26
Observe
intently
the
birds
of
heaven
they
do
not
sow
seed
or
reap
or
gather
into
storehouses
yet
your
heavenly
Father
feeds
them
Are
you
not
worth
more
than
they
are
27
Who
of
you
by
being
anxious
can
add
one
cubit
to
his
life
span
28
Also
why
are
you
anxious
about
clothing
Take
a
lesson
from
the
lilies
of
the
field
how
they
grow
they
do
not
toil
nor
do
they
spin
29
but
I
tell
you
that
not
even
Solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
arrayed
as
one
of
these
30
Now
if
this
is
how
God
clothes
the
vegetation
of
the
field
that
is
here
today
and
tomorrow
is
thrown
into
the
oven
will
he
not
much
rather
clothe
you
you
with
little
faith
31
So
never
be
anxious
and
say
What
are
we
to
eat
or
What
are
we
to
drink
or
What
are
we
to
wear
32
For
all
these
are
the
things
the
nations
are
eagerly
pursuing
Your
heavenly
Father
knows
that
you
need
all
these
things
33
Keep
on
then
seeking
first
the
Kingdom
and
his
righteousness
and
all
these
other
things
will
be
added
to
you
34
So
never
be
anxious
about
the
next
day
for
the
next
day
will
have
its
own
anxieties
Each
day
has
enough
of
its
own
troubles
1
Stop
judging
that
you
may
not
be
judged
2
for
with
the
judgment
you
are
judging
you
will
be
judged
and
with
the
measure
that
you
are
measuring
out
they
will
measure
out
to
you
3
Why
then
do
you
look
at
the
straw
in
your
brothers
eye
but
do
not
notice
the
rafter
in
your
own
eye
4
Or
how
can
you
say
to
your
brother
Allow
me
to
remove
the
straw
from
your
eye

when
look
a
rafter
is
in
your
own
eye
5
Hypocrite
First
remove
the
rafter
from
your
own
eye
and
then
you
will
see
clearly
how
to
remove
the
straw
from
your
brothers
eye
6
Do
not
give
what
is
holy
to
dogs
nor
throw
your
pearls
before
swine
so
that
they
may
never
trample
them
under
their
feet
and
turn
around
and
rip
you
open
7
Keep
on
asking
and
it
will
be
given
you
keep
on
seeking
and
you
will
find
keep
on
knocking
and
it
will
be
opened
to
you
8
for
everyone
asking
receives
and
everyone
seeking
finds
and
to
everyone
knocking
it
will
be
opened
9
Indeed
which
one
of
you
if
his
son
asks
for
bread
will
hand
him
a
stone
10
Or
if
he
asks
for
a
fish
he
will
not
hand
him
a
serpent
will
he
11
Therefore
if
you
although
being
wicked
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
to
your
children
how
much
more
so
will
your
Father
who
is
in
the
heavens
give
good
things
to
those
asking
him
12
All
things
therefore
that
you
want
men
to
do
to
you
you
also
must
do
to
them
This
in
fact
is
what
the
Law
and
the
Prophets
mean
13
Go
in
through
the
narrow
gate
because
broad
is
the
gate
and
spacious
is
the
road
leading
off
into
destruction
and
many
are
going
in
through
it
14
whereas
narrow
is
the
gate
and
cramped
the
road
leading
off
into
life
and
few
are
finding
it
15
Be
on
the
watch
for
the
false
prophets
who
come
to
you
in
sheeps
covering
but
inside
they
are
ravenous
wolves
16
By
their
fruits
you
will
recognize
them
Never
do
people
gather
grapes
from
thorns
or
figs
from
thistles
do
they
17
Likewise
every
good
tree
produces
fine
fruit
but
every
rotten
tree
produces
worthless
fruit
18
A
good
tree
cannot
bear
worthless
fruit
nor
can
a
rotten
tree
produce
fine
fruit
19
Every
tree
not
producing
fine
fruit
is
cut
down
and
thrown
into
the
fire
20
Really
then
by
their
fruits
you
will
recognize
those
men
21
Not
everyone
saying
to
me
Lord
Lord

will
enter
into
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
but
only
the
one
doing
the
will
of
my
Father
who
is
in
the
heavens
will
22
Many
will
say
to
me
in
that
day
Lord
Lord
did
we
not
prophesy
in
your
name
and
expel
demons
in
your
name
and
perform
many
powerful
works
in
your
name
23
And
then
I
will
declare
to
them
I
never
knew
you
Get
away
from
me
you
workers
of
lawlessness
24
Therefore
everyone
who
hears
these
sayings
of
mine
and
does
them
will
be
like
a
discreet
man
who
built
his
house
on
the
rock
25
And
the
rain
poured
down
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
lashed
against
that
house
but
it
did
not
cave
in
for
it
had
been
founded
on
the
rock
26
Furthermore
everyone
hearing
these
sayings
of
mine
and
not
doing
them
will
be
like
a
foolish
man
who
built
his
house
on
the
sand
27
And
the
rain
poured
down
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
struck
against
that
house
and
it
caved
in
and
its
collapse
was
great
28
When
Jesus
finished
these
sayings
the
effect
was
that
the
crowds
were
astounded
at
his
way
of
teaching
29
for
he
was
teaching
them
as
a
person
having
authority
and
not
as
their
scribes
1
After
he
came
down
from
the
mountain
large
crowds
followed
him
2
And
look
a
leper
came
up
and
did
obeisance
to
him
saying
Lord
if
you
just
want
to
you
can
make
me
clean
3
So
stretching
out
his
hand
he
touched
him
saying
I
want
to
Be
made
clean
Immediately
his
leprosy
was
cleansed
away
4
Then
Jesus
said
to
him
See
that
you
tell
no
one
but
go
show
yourself
to
the
priest
and
offer
the
gift
that
Moses
appointed
for
a
witness
to
them
5
When
he
entered
Capernaum
an
army
officer
came
to
him
pleading
with
him
6
and
saying
Sir
my
servant
is
laid
up
in
the
house
with
paralysis
and
he
is
suffering
terribly
7
He
said
to
him
When
I
get
there
I
will
cure
him
8
The
army
officer
replied
Sir
I
am
not
worthy
to
have
you
come
under
my
roof
but
just
say
the
word
and
my
servant
will
be
healed
9
For
I
too
am
a
man
under
authority
having
soldiers
under
me
and
I
say
to
this
one
Go
and
he
goes
and
to
another
Come
and
he
comes
and
to
my
slave
Do
this
and
he
does
it
10
When
Jesus
heard
that
he
was
amazed
and
said
to
those
following
him
I
tell
you
the
truth
with
no
one
in
Israel
have
I
found
so
great
a
faith
11
But
I
tell
you
that
many
from
east
and
west
will
come
and
recline
at
the
table
with
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
12
whereas
the
sons
of
the
Kingdom
will
be
thrown
into
the
darkness
outside
There
is
where
their
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
their
teeth
will
be
13
Then
Jesus
said
to
the
army
officer
Go
Just
as
you
have
shown
faith
so
let
it
come
to
pass
for
you
And
the
servant
was
healed
in
that
hour
14
And
Jesus
on
coming
into
Peters
house
saw
his
mother-in-law
lying
down
and
sick
with
fever
15
So
he
touched
her
hand
and
the
fever
left
her
and
she
got
up
and
began
ministering
to
him
16
But
after
it
became
evening
people
brought
him
many
demon-possessed
ones
and
he
expelled
the
spirits
with
a
word
and
he
cured
all
who
were
suffering
17
in
order
to
fulfill
what
was
spoken
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
He
himself
took
our
sicknesses
and
carried
our
diseases
18
When
Jesus
saw
a
crowd
around
him
he
gave
the
command
to
depart
for
the
other
side
19
And
a
scribe
came
up
and
said
to
him
Teacher
I
will
follow
you
wherever
you
go
20
But
Jesus
said
to
him
Foxes
have
dens
and
birds
of
heaven
have
nests
but
the
Son
of
man
has
nowhere
to
lay
down
his
head
21
Then
another
of
the
disciples
said
to
him
Lord
permit
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
father
22
Jesus
said
to
him
Keep
following
me
and
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
23
And
when
he
went
aboard
a
boat
his
disciples
followed
him
24
Now
look
a
great
storm
arose
on
the
sea
so
that
the
boat
was
being
covered
by
the
waves
but
he
was
sleeping
25
And
they
came
and
woke
him
up
saying
Lord
save
us
we
are
about
to
perish
26
But
he
said
to
them
Why
are
you
so
afraid
you
with
little
faith
Then
he
got
up
and
rebuked
the
winds
and
the
sea
and
a
great
calm
set
in
27
So
the
men
were
amazed
and
said
What
sort
of
person
is
this
Even
the
winds
and
the
sea
obey
him
28
When
he
came
to
the
other
side
into
the
region
of
the
Gadarenes
two
demon-possessed
men
coming
out
from
among
the
tombs
met
him
They
were
unusually
fierce
so
nobody
had
the
courage
to
pass
by
on
that
road
29
And
look
they
screamed
saying
What
have
we
to
do
with
you
Son
of
God
Did
you
come
here
to
torment
us
before
the
appointed
time
30
A
long
way
off
from
them
a
herd
of
many
swine
was
feeding
31
So
the
demons
began
to
plead
with
him
saying
If
you
expel
us
send
us
into
the
herd
of
swine
32
And
he
said
to
them
Go
With
that
they
came
out
and
went
off
into
the
swine
and
look
the
entire
herd
rushed
over
the
precipice
into
the
sea
and
died
in
the
waters
33
But
the
herders
fled
and
going
into
the
city
they
reported
everything
including
the
account
of
the
demon-possessed
men
34
And
look
all
the
city
turned
out
to
meet
Jesus
and
when
they
saw
him
they
urged
him
to
depart
from
their
region
1
So
boarding
the
boat
he
traveled
across
and
went
into
his
own
city
2
And
look
they
were
bringing
him
a
paralyzed
man
lying
on
a
stretcher
On
seeing
their
faith
Jesus
said
to
the
paralytic
Take
courage
child
Your
sins
are
forgiven
3
Now
certain
scribes
said
to
themselves
This
fellow
is
blaspheming
4
Jesus
knowing
their
thoughts
said
Why
are
you
thinking
wicked
things
in
your
hearts
5
For
instance
which
is
easier
to
say
Your
sins
are
forgiven

or
to
say
Get
up
and
walk
6
However
in
order
for
you
to
know
that
the
Son
of
man
has
authority
on
earth
to
forgive
sins—
then
he
said
to
the
paralytic
Get
up
pick
up
your
stretcher
and
go
to
your
home
7
And
he
got
up
and
went
to
his
home
8
When
the
crowds
saw
this
they
were
struck
with
fear
and
they
glorified
God
who
gave
such
authority
to
men
9
Next
while
moving
on
from
there
Jesus
caught
sight
of
a
man
named
Matthew
sitting
at
the
tax
office
and
he
said
to
him
Be
my
follower
At
that
he
rose
up
and
followed
him
10
Later
as
he
was
dining
in
the
house
look
many
tax
collectors
and
sinners
came
and
began
dining
with
Jesus
and
his
disciples
11
But
on
seeing
this
the
Pharisees
said
to
his
disciples
Why
does
your
teacher
eat
with
tax
collectors
and
sinners
12
Hearing
them
he
said
Healthy
people
do
not
need
a
physician
but
those
who
are
ill
do
13
Go
then
and
learn
what
this
means
I
want
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
For
I
came
to
call
not
righteous
people
but
sinners
14
Then
Johns
disciples
came
to
him
and
asked
Why
do
we
and
the
Pharisees
practice
fasting
but
your
disciples
do
not
fast
15
At
this
Jesus
said
to
them
The
friends
of
the
bridegroom
have
no
reason
to
mourn
as
long
as
the
bridegroom
is
with
them
do
they
But
days
will
come
when
the
bridegroom
will
be
taken
away
from
them
and
then
they
will
fast
16
Nobody
sews
a
patch
of
unshrunk
cloth
on
an
old
outer
garment
for
the
new
piece
pulls
away
from
the
garment
and
the
tear
becomes
worse
17
Nor
do
people
put
new
wine
into
old
wineskins
If
they
do
then
the
wineskins
burst
and
the
wine
spills
out
and
the
wineskins
are
ruined
But
people
put
new
wine
into
new
wineskins
and
both
are
preserved
18
While
he
was
telling
them
these
things
look
a
certain
ruler
who
had
approached
did
obeisance
to
him
saying
By
now
my
daughter
must
be
dead
but
come
and
lay
your
hand
on
her
and
she
will
come
to
life
19
Then
Jesus
got
up
and
with
his
disciples
followed
him
20
And
look
a
woman
suffering
for
12
years
from
a
flow
of
blood
approached
from
behind
and
touched
the
fringe
of
his
outer
garment
21
for
she
kept
saying
to
herself
If
I
only
touch
his
outer
garment
I
will
get
well
22
Jesus
turned
around
and
noticing
her
said
Take
courage
daughter
Your
faith
has
made
you
well
And
from
that
hour
the
woman
was
made
well
23
When
now
he
came
into
the
rulers
house
and
caught
sight
of
the
flute
players
and
the
crowd
making
a
commotion
24
Jesus
said
Leave
the
place
for
the
little
girl
did
not
die
but
is
sleeping
At
this
they
began
to
laugh
at
him
scornfully
25
As
soon
as
the
crowd
had
been
sent
outside
he
went
in
and
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
the
little
girl
got
up
26
Of
course
the
talk
about
this
spread
into
all
that
region
27
As
Jesus
moved
on
from
there
two
blind
men
followed
him
shouting
out
Have
mercy
on
us
Son
of
David
28
After
he
had
gone
into
the
house
the
blind
men
came
to
him
and
Jesus
asked
them
Do
you
have
faith
that
I
can
do
this
They
answered
him
Yes
Lord
29
Then
he
touched
their
eyes
saying
According
to
your
faith
let
it
happen
to
you
30
And
their
eyes
received
sight
Moreover
Jesus
sternly
warned
them
saying
See
that
nobody
gets
to
know
it
31
But
after
going
outside
they
made
it
public
about
him
in
all
that
region
32
When
they
were
leaving
look
people
brought
him
a
speechless
man
possessed
of
a
demon
33
and
after
the
demon
had
been
expelled
the
speechless
man
spoke
Well
the
crowds
were
amazed
and
said
Never
has
anything
like
this
been
seen
in
Israel
34
But
the
Pharisees
were
saying
It
is
by
the
ruler
of
the
demons
that
he
expels
the
demons
35
And
Jesus
set
out
on
a
tour
of
all
the
cities
and
villages
teaching
in
their
synagogues
and
preaching
the
good
news
of
the
Kingdom
and
curing
every
sort
of
disease
and
every
sort
of
infirmity
36
On
seeing
the
crowds
he
felt
pity
for
them
because
they
were
skinned
and
thrown
about
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
37
Then
he
said
to
his
disciples
Yes
the
harvest
is
great
but
the
workers
are
few
38
Therefore
beg
the
Master
of
the
harvest
to
send
out
workers
into
his
harvest
1
So
he
summoned
his
12
disciples
and
gave
them
authority
over
unclean
spirits
in
order
to
expel
these
and
to
cure
every
sort
of
disease
and
every
sort
of
infirmity
2
The
names
of
the
12
apostles
are
these
First
Simon
the
one
called
Peter
and
Andrew
his
brother
James
the
son
of
Zebedee
and
John
his
brother
3
Philip
and
Bartholomew
Thomas
and
Matthew
the
tax
collector
James
the
son
of
Alphaeus
Thaddaeus
4
Simon
the
Cananaean
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
later
betrayed
him
5
These
12
Jesus
sent
out
giving
them
these
instructions
Do
not
go
off
into
the
road
of
the
nations
and
do
not
enter
any
Samaritan
city
6
but
instead
go
continually
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
Israel
7
As
you
go
preach
saying
The
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
has
drawn
near
8
Cure
the
sick
raise
up
the
dead
make
lepers
clean
expel
demons
You
received
free
give
free
9
Do
not
acquire
gold
or
silver
or
copper
for
your
money
belts
10
or
a
food
pouch
for
the
trip
or
two
garments
or
sandals
or
a
staff
for
the
worker
deserves
his
food
11
Into
whatever
city
or
village
you
enter
search
out
who
in
it
is
deserving
and
stay
there
until
you
leave
12
When
you
enter
the
house
greet
the
household
13
If
the
house
is
deserving
let
the
peace
you
wish
it
come
upon
it
but
if
it
is
not
deserving
let
the
peace
from
you
return
upon
you
14
Wherever
anyone
does
not
receive
you
or
listen
to
your
words
on
going
out
of
that
house
or
that
city
shake
the
dust
off
your
feet
15
Truly
I
say
to
you
it
will
be
more
endurable
for
the
land
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
on
Judgment
Day
than
for
that
city
16
Look
I
am
sending
you
out
as
sheep
among
wolves
so
prove
yourselves
cautious
as
serpents
and
yet
innocent
as
doves
17
Be
on
your
guard
against
men
for
they
will
hand
you
over
to
local
courts
and
they
will
scourge
you
in
their
synagogues
18
And
you
will
be
brought
before
governors
and
kings
for
my
sake
for
a
witness
to
them
and
the
nations
19
However
when
they
hand
you
over
do
not
become
anxious
about
how
or
what
you
are
to
speak
for
what
you
are
to
speak
will
be
given
you
in
that
hour
20
for
the
ones
speaking
are
not
just
you
but
it
is
the
spirit
of
your
Father
that
speaks
by
you
21
Further
brother
will
hand
brother
over
to
death
and
a
father
his
child
and
children
will
rise
up
against
parents
and
will
have
them
put
to
death
22
And
you
will
be
hated
by
all
people
on
account
of
my
name
but
the
one
who
has
endured
to
the
end
will
be
saved
23
When
they
persecute
you
in
one
city
flee
to
another
for
truly
I
say
to
you
you
will
by
no
means
complete
the
circuit
of
the
cities
of
Israel
until
the
Son
of
man
arrives
24
A
student
is
not
above
his
teacher
nor
a
slave
above
his
master
25
It
is
enough
for
the
student
to
become
as
his
teacher
and
the
slave
as
his
master
If
people
have
called
the
master
of
the
house
Beelzebub
how
much
more
those
of
his
household
26
So
do
not
fear
them
for
there
is
nothing
covered
over
that
will
not
become
uncovered
and
nothing
secret
that
will
not
become
known
27
What
I
tell
you
in
the
darkness
say
in
the
light
and
what
you
hear
whispered
preach
from
the
housetops
28
And
do
not
become
fearful
of
those
who
kill
the
body
but
cannot
kill
the
soul
rather
fear
him
who
can
destroy
both
soul
and
body
in
Gehenna
29
Two
sparrows
sell
for
a
coin
of
small
value
do
they
not
Yet
not
one
of
them
will
fall
to
the
ground
without
your
Fathers
knowledge
30
But
even
the
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered
31
So
have
no
fear
you
are
worth
more
than
many
sparrows
32
Everyone
then
who
acknowledges
me
before
men
I
will
also
acknowledge
him
before
my
Father
who
is
in
the
heavens
33
But
whoever
disowns
me
before
men
I
will
also
disown
him
before
my
Father
who
is
in
the
heavens
34
Do
not
think
I
came
to
bring
peace
to
the
earth
I
came
to
bring
not
peace
but
a
sword
35
For
I
came
to
cause
division
with
a
man
against
his
father
and
a
daughter
against
her
mother
and
a
daughter-in-law
against
her
mother-in-law
36
Indeed
a
mans
enemies
will
be
those
of
his
own
household
37
Whoever
has
greater
affection
for
father
or
mother
than
for
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
and
whoever
has
greater
affection
for
son
or
daughter
than
for
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
38
And
whoever
does
not
accept
his
torture
stake
and
follow
after
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
39
Whoever
finds
his
soul
will
lose
it
and
whoever
loses
his
soul
for
my
sake
will
find
it
40
Whoever
receives
you
receives
me
also
and
whoever
receives
me
receives
also
the
One
who
sent
me
41
Whoever
receives
a
prophet
because
he
is
a
prophet
will
get
a
prophets
reward
and
whoever
receives
a
righteous
man
because
he
is
a
righteous
man
will
get
a
righteous
mans
reward
42
And
whoever
gives
one
of
these
little
ones
only
a
cup
of
cold
water
to
drink
because
he
is
a
disciple
I
tell
you
truly
he
will
by
no
means
lose
his
reward
1
When
Jesus
had
finished
giving
instructions
to
his
12
disciples
he
set
out
from
there
to
teach
and
preach
in
their
cities
2
But
John
having
heard
in
jail
about
the
works
of
the
Christ
sent
his
disciples
3
to
ask
him
Are
you
the
Coming
One
or
are
we
to
expect
a
different
one
4
In
reply
Jesus
said
to
them
Go
and
report
to
John
what
you
are
hearing
and
seeing
5
The
blind
are
now
seeing
and
the
lame
are
walking
the
lepers
are
being
cleansed
and
the
deaf
are
hearing
the
dead
are
being
raised
up
and
the
poor
are
being
told
the
good
news
6
Happy
is
the
one
who
finds
no
cause
for
stumbling
in
me
7
While
these
were
on
their
way
Jesus
began
to
speak
to
the
crowds
about
John
What
did
you
go
out
into
the
wilderness
to
see
A
reed
being
tossed
by
the
wind
8
What
then
did
you
go
out
to
see
A
man
dressed
in
soft
garments
Why
those
wearing
soft
garments
are
in
the
houses
of
kings
9
Really
then
why
did
you
go
out
To
see
a
prophet
Yes
I
tell
you
and
far
more
than
a
prophet
10
This
is
the
one
about
whom
it
is
written
Look
I
am
sending
my
messenger
ahead
of
you
who
will
prepare
your
way
ahead
of
you
11
Truly
I
say
to
you
among
those
born
of
women
there
has
not
been
raised
up
anyone
greater
than
John
the
Baptist
but
a
lesser
person
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
is
greater
than
he
is
12
From
the
days
of
John
the
Baptist
until
now
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
is
the
goal
toward
which
men
press
and
those
pressing
forward
are
seizing
it
13
For
all
the
Prophets
and
the
Law
prophesied
until
John
14
and
if
you
are
willing
to
accept
it
he
is
Elijah
who
is
to
come
15
Let
the
one
who
has
ears
listen
16
With
whom
will
I
compare
this
generation
It
is
like
young
children
sitting
in
the
marketplaces
who
call
out
to
their
playmates
17
saying
We
played
the
flute
for
you
but
you
did
not
dance
we
wailed
but
you
did
not
beat
yourselves
in
grief
18
Likewise
John
came
neither
eating
nor
drinking
but
people
say
He
has
a
demon
19
The
Son
of
man
did
come
eating
and
drinking
but
people
say
Look
A
man
who
is
a
glutton
and
is
given
to
drinking
wine
a
friend
of
tax
collectors
and
sinners
All
the
same
wisdom
is
proved
righteous
by
its
works
20
Then
he
began
to
reproach
the
cities
in
which
most
of
his
powerful
works
had
taken
place
for
they
did
not
repent
21
Woe
to
you
Chorazin
Woe
to
you
Bethsaida
because
if
the
powerful
works
that
took
place
in
you
had
taken
place
in
Tyre
and
Sidon
they
would
long
ago
have
repented
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
22
But
I
say
to
you
it
will
be
more
endurable
for
Tyre
and
Sidon
on
Judgment
Day
than
for
you
23
And
you
Capernaum
will
you
perhaps
be
exalted
to
heaven
Down
to
the
Grave
you
will
come
because
if
the
powerful
works
that
took
place
in
you
had
taken
place
in
Sodom
it
would
have
remained
until
this
very
day
24
But
I
say
to
you
it
will
be
more
endurable
for
the
land
of
Sodom
on
Judgment
Day
than
for
you
25
At
that
time
Jesus
said
in
response
I
publicly
praise
you
Father
Lord
of
heaven
and
earth
because
you
have
hidden
these
things
from
the
wise
and
intellectual
ones
and
have
revealed
them
to
young
children
26
Yes
O
Father
because
this
is
the
way
you
approved
27
All
things
have
been
handed
over
to
me
by
my
Father
and
no
one
fully
knows
the
Son
except
the
Father
neither
does
anyone
fully
know
the
Father
except
the
Son
and
anyone
to
whom
the
Son
is
willing
to
reveal
him
28
Come
to
me
all
you
who
are
toiling
and
loaded
down
and
I
will
refresh
you
29
Take
my
yoke
upon
you
and
learn
from
me
for
I
am
mild-tempered
and
lowly
in
heart
and
you
will
find
refreshment
for
yourselves
30
For
my
yoke
is
kindly
and
my
load
is
light
1
At
that
time
Jesus
went
through
the
grainfields
on
the
Sabbath
His
disciples
got
hungry
and
started
to
pluck
heads
of
grain
and
to
eat
2
At
seeing
this
the
Pharisees
said
to
him
Look
Your
disciples
are
doing
what
is
not
lawful
to
do
on
the
Sabbath
3
He
said
to
them
Have
you
not
read
what
David
did
when
he
and
the
men
with
him
were
hungry
4
How
he
entered
into
the
house
of
God
and
they
ate
the
loaves
of
presentation
something
that
it
was
not
lawful
for
him
or
those
with
him
to
eat
but
for
the
priests
only
5
Or
have
you
not
read
in
the
Law
that
on
the
Sabbaths
the
priests
in
the
temple
violate
the
Sabbath
and
continue
guiltless
6
But
I
tell
you
that
something
greater
than
the
temple
is
here
7
However
if
you
had
understood
what
this
means
I
want
mercy
and
not
sacrifice

you
would
not
have
condemned
the
guiltless
ones
8
For
the
Son
of
man
is
Lord
of
the
Sabbath
9
After
departing
from
that
place
he
went
into
their
synagogue
10
and
look
there
was
a
man
with
a
withered
hand
So
they
asked
him
Is
it
lawful
to
cure
on
the
Sabbath
so
that
they
might
accuse
him
11
He
said
to
them
If
you
have
one
sheep
and
that
sheep
falls
into
a
pit
on
the
Sabbath
is
there
a
man
among
you
who
will
not
grab
hold
of
it
and
lift
it
out
12
How
much
more
valuable
is
a
man
than
a
sheep
So
it
is
lawful
to
do
a
fine
thing
on
the
Sabbath
13
Then
he
said
to
the
man
Stretch
out
your
hand
And
he
stretched
it
out
and
it
was
restored
sound
like
the
other
hand
14
But
the
Pharisees
went
out
and
conspired
against
him
to
kill
him
15
Having
come
to
know
this
Jesus
departed
from
there
Many
also
followed
him
and
he
cured
them
all
16
but
he
sternly
ordered
them
not
to
make
him
known
17
in
order
to
fulfill
what
was
spoken
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
who
said
18
Look
My
servant
whom
I
chose
my
beloved
whom
I
have
approved
I
will
put
my
spirit
upon
him
and
what
justice
is
he
will
make
clear
to
the
nations
19
He
will
not
quarrel
nor
cry
aloud
nor
will
anyone
hear
his
voice
in
the
main
streets
20
No
bruised
reed
will
he
crush
and
no
smoldering
wick
will
he
extinguish
until
he
brings
justice
with
success
21
Indeed
in
his
name
nations
will
hope
22
Then
they
brought
him
a
demon-possessed
man
who
was
blind
and
speechless
and
he
cured
him
so
that
the
speechless
man
could
speak
and
see
23
Well
all
the
crowds
were
astounded
and
began
to
say
May
this
not
perhaps
be
the
Son
of
David
24
At
hearing
this
the
Pharisees
said
This
fellow
does
not
expel
the
demons
except
by
means
of
Beelzebub
the
ruler
of
the
demons
25
Knowing
their
thoughts
he
said
to
them
Every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
comes
to
ruin
and
every
city
or
house
divided
against
itself
will
not
stand
26
In
the
same
way
if
Satan
expels
Satan
he
has
become
divided
against
himself
how
then
will
his
kingdom
stand
27
Moreover
if
I
expel
the
demons
by
means
of
Beelzebub
by
whom
do
your
sons
expel
them
This
is
why
they
will
be
your
judges
28
But
if
it
is
by
means
of
Gods
spirit
that
I
expel
the
demons
the
Kingdom
of
God
has
really
overtaken
you
29
Or
how
can
anyone
invade
the
house
of
a
strong
man
and
seize
his
possessions
unless
he
first
ties
up
the
strong
man
Only
then
can
he
plunder
his
house
30
Whoever
is
not
on
my
side
is
against
me
and
whoever
does
not
gather
with
me
scatters
31
For
this
reason
I
say
to
you
every
sort
of
sin
and
blasphemy
will
be
forgiven
men
but
the
blasphemy
against
the
spirit
will
not
be
forgiven
32
For
example
whoever
speaks
a
word
against
the
Son
of
man
it
will
be
forgiven
him
but
whoever
speaks
against
the
holy
spirit
it
will
not
be
forgiven
him
no
not
in
this
system
of
things
nor
in
that
to
come
33
Either
you
make
the
tree
fine
and
its
fruit
fine
or
make
the
tree
rotten
and
its
fruit
rotten
for
by
its
fruit
the
tree
is
known
34
Offspring
of
vipers
how
can
you
speak
good
things
when
you
are
wicked
For
out
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaks
35
The
good
man
out
of
his
good
treasure
sends
out
good
things
whereas
the
wicked
man
out
of
his
wicked
treasure
sends
out
wicked
things
36
I
tell
you
that
men
will
render
an
account
on
Judgment
Day
for
every
unprofitable
saying
that
they
speak
37
for
by
your
words
you
will
be
declared
righteous
and
by
your
words
you
will
be
condemned
38
Then
as
an
answer
to
him
some
of
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
said
Teacher
we
want
to
see
a
sign
from
you
39
In
reply
he
said
to
them
A
wicked
and
adulterous
generation
keeps
on
seeking
a
sign
but
no
sign
will
be
given
it
except
the
sign
of
Jonah
the
prophet
40
For
just
as
Jonah
was
in
the
belly
of
the
huge
fish
for
three
days
and
three
nights
so
the
Son
of
man
will
be
in
the
heart
of
the
earth
for
three
days
and
three
nights
41
Men
of
Nineveh
will
rise
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
generation
and
will
condemn
it
because
they
repented
at
what
Jonah
preached
But
look
something
more
than
Jonah
is
here
42
The
queen
of
the
south
will
be
raised
up
in
the
judgment
with
this
generation
and
will
condemn
it
for
she
came
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
Solomon
But
look
something
more
than
Solomon
is
here
43
When
an
unclean
spirit
comes
out
of
a
man
it
passes
through
waterless
places
in
search
of
a
resting-place
and
finds
none
44
Then
it
says
I
will
go
back
to
my
house
from
which
I
moved

and
on
arriving
it
finds
the
house
unoccupied
but
swept
clean
and
adorned
45
Then
it
goes
and
takes
along
with
it
seven
different
spirits
more
wicked
than
itself
and
after
getting
inside
they
dwell
there
and
the
final
circumstances
of
that
man
become
worse
than
the
first
That
is
how
it
will
be
also
with
this
wicked
generation
46
While
he
was
yet
speaking
to
the
crowds
his
mother
and
brothers
were
standing
outside
seeking
to
speak
to
him
47
So
someone
said
to
him
Look
Your
mother
and
your
brothers
are
standing
outside
seeking
to
speak
to
you
48
In
reply
he
said
to
the
one
who
spoke
to
him
Who
is
my
mother
and
who
are
my
brothers
49
And
extending
his
hand
toward
his
disciples
he
said
Look
My
mother
and
my
brothers
50
For
whoever
does
the
will
of
my
Father
who
is
in
heaven
that
one
is
my
brother
and
sister
and
mother
1
On
that
day
Jesus
left
the
house
and
was
sitting
by
the
sea
2
And
such
large
crowds
gathered
to
him
that
he
went
aboard
a
boat
and
sat
down
and
all
the
crowd
was
standing
on
the
beach
3
Then
he
told
them
many
things
by
illustrations
saying
Look
A
sower
went
out
to
sow
4
As
he
was
sowing
some
seeds
fell
alongside
the
road
and
the
birds
came
and
ate
them
up
5
Others
fell
on
rocky
ground
where
there
was
not
much
soil
and
they
immediately
sprang
up
because
the
soil
was
not
deep
6
But
when
the
sun
rose
they
were
scorched
and
they
withered
because
they
had
no
root
7
Others
fell
among
the
thorns
and
the
thorns
came
up
and
choked
them
8
Still
others
fell
on
the
fine
soil
and
they
began
to
yield
fruit
this
one
100
times
more
that
one
60
the
other
30
9
Let
the
one
who
has
ears
listen
10
So
the
disciples
came
and
said
to
him
Why
do
you
speak
to
them
by
the
use
of
illustrations
11
In
reply
he
said
To
you
it
is
granted
to
understand
the
sacred
secrets
of
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
but
to
them
it
is
not
granted
12
For
whoever
has
more
will
be
given
him
and
he
will
be
made
to
abound
but
whoever
does
not
have
even
what
he
has
will
be
taken
from
him
13
That
is
why
I
speak
to
them
by
the
use
of
illustrations
for
looking
they
look
in
vain
and
hearing
they
hear
in
vain
nor
do
they
get
the
sense
of
it
14
And
the
prophecy
of
Isaiah
is
being
fulfilled
in
their
case
It
says
You
will
indeed
hear
but
by
no
means
get
the
sense
of
it
and
you
will
indeed
look
but
by
no
means
see
15
For
the
heart
of
this
people
has
grown
unreceptive
and
with
their
ears
they
have
heard
without
response
and
they
have
shut
their
eyes
so
that
they
might
never
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
get
the
sense
of
it
with
their
hearts
and
turn
back
and
I
heal
them
16
However
happy
are
your
eyes
because
they
see
and
your
ears
because
they
hear
17
For
truly
I
say
to
you
many
prophets
and
righteous
men
desired
to
see
the
things
you
are
observing
but
did
not
see
them
and
to
hear
the
things
you
are
hearing
but
did
not
hear
them
18
Now
listen
to
the
illustration
of
the
man
who
sowed
19
Where
anyone
hears
the
word
of
the
Kingdom
but
does
not
get
the
sense
of
it
the
wicked
one
comes
and
snatches
away
what
has
been
sown
in
his
heart
this
is
the
one
sown
alongside
the
road
20
As
for
the
one
sown
on
rocky
ground
this
is
the
one
hearing
the
word
and
at
once
accepting
it
with
joy
21
Yet
he
has
no
root
in
himself
but
continues
for
a
time
and
after
tribulation
or
persecution
has
arisen
on
account
of
the
word
he
is
at
once
stumbled
22
As
for
the
one
sown
among
the
thorns
this
is
the
one
hearing
the
word
but
the
anxiety
of
this
system
of
things
and
the
deceptive
power
of
riches
choke
the
word
and
it
becomes
unfruitful
23
As
for
the
one
sown
upon
the
fine
soil
this
is
the
one
hearing
the
word
and
getting
the
sense
of
it
who
really
does
bear
fruit
and
produces
this
one
100
times
more
that
one
60
the
other
30
24
He
presented
another
illustration
to
them
saying
The
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
may
be
likened
to
a
man
who
sowed
fine
seed
in
his
field
25
While
men
were
sleeping
his
enemy
came
and
oversowed
weeds
in
among
the
wheat
and
left
26
When
the
stalk
sprouted
and
produced
fruit
then
the
weeds
also
appeared
27
So
the
slaves
of
the
master
of
the
house
came
and
said
to
him
Master
did
you
not
sow
fine
seed
in
your
field
How
then
does
it
have
weeds
28
He
said
to
them
An
enemy
a
man
did
this
The
slaves
said
to
him
Do
you
want
us
then
to
go
out
and
collect
them
29
He
said
No
for
fear
that
while
collecting
the
weeds
you
uproot
the
wheat
with
them
30
Let
both
grow
together
until
the
harvest
and
in
the
harvest
season
I
will
tell
the
reapers
First
collect
the
weeds
and
bind
them
in
bundles
to
burn
them
up
then
gather
the
wheat
into
my
storehouse
31
He
presented
another
illustration
to
them
saying
The
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
is
like
a
mustard
grain
that
a
man
took
and
planted
in
his
field
32
It
is
in
fact
the
tiniest
of
all
the
seeds
but
when
it
has
grown
it
is
the
largest
of
the
vegetable
plants
and
becomes
a
tree
so
that
the
birds
of
heaven
come
and
find
lodging
among
its
branches
33
He
told
them
another
illustration
The
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
is
like
leaven
that
a
woman
took
and
mixed
with
three
large
measures
of
flour
until
the
whole
mass
was
fermented
34
All
these
things
Jesus
spoke
to
the
crowds
by
illustrations
Indeed
without
an
illustration
he
would
not
speak
to
them
35
in
order
to
fulfill
what
was
spoken
through
the
prophet
who
said
I
will
open
my
mouth
with
illustrations
I
will
proclaim
things
hidden
since
the
founding
36
Then
after
dismissing
the
crowds
he
went
into
the
house
His
disciples
came
to
him
and
said
Explain
to
us
the
illustration
of
the
weeds
in
the
field
37
In
response
he
said
The
sower
of
the
fine
seed
is
the
Son
of
man
38
the
field
is
the
world
As
for
the
fine
seed
these
are
the
sons
of
the
Kingdom
but
the
weeds
are
the
sons
of
the
wicked
one
39
and
the
enemy
who
sowed
them
is
the
Devil
The
harvest
is
a
conclusion
of
a
system
of
things
and
the
reapers
are
angels
40
Therefore
just
as
the
weeds
are
collected
and
burned
with
fire
so
it
will
be
in
the
conclusion
of
the
system
of
things
41
The
Son
of
man
will
send
his
angels
and
they
will
collect
out
from
his
Kingdom
all
things
that
cause
stumbling
and
people
who
practice
lawlessness
42
and
they
will
pitch
them
into
the
fiery
furnace
There
is
where
their
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
their
teeth
will
be
43
At
that
time
the
righteous
ones
will
shine
as
brightly
as
the
sun
in
the
Kingdom
of
their
Father
Let
the
one
who
has
ears
listen
44
The
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
is
like
a
treasure
hidden
in
the
field
that
a
man
found
and
hid
and
because
of
his
joy
he
goes
and
sells
everything
he
has
and
buys
that
field
45
Again
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
is
like
a
traveling
merchant
seeking
fine
pearls
46
Upon
finding
one
pearl
of
high
value
he
went
away
and
promptly
sold
all
the
things
he
had
and
bought
it
47
Again
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
is
like
a
dragnet
let
down
into
the
sea
and
gathering
fish
of
every
kind
48
When
it
was
full
they
hauled
it
up
onto
the
beach
and
sitting
down
they
collected
the
fine
ones
into
containers
but
the
unsuitable
they
threw
away
49
That
is
how
it
will
be
in
the
conclusion
of
the
system
of
things
The
angels
will
go
out
and
separate
the
wicked
from
among
the
righteous
50
and
will
cast
them
into
the
fiery
furnace
There
is
where
their
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
their
teeth
will
be
51
Did
you
get
the
sense
of
all
these
things
They
said
to
him
Yes
52
Then
he
said
to
them
That
being
the
case
every
public
instructor
who
is
taught
about
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
is
like
a
man
the
master
of
the
house
who
brings
out
of
his
treasure
store
things
both
new
and
old
53
When
Jesus
had
finished
these
illustrations
he
departed
from
there
54
After
coming
into
his
home
territory
he
began
to
teach
them
in
their
synagogue
so
that
they
were
astounded
and
said
Where
did
this
man
get
this
wisdom
and
these
powerful
works
55
Is
this
not
the
carpenters
son
Is
not
his
mother
called
Mary
and
his
brothers
James
and
Joseph
and
Simon
and
Judas
56
And
his
sisters
are
they
not
all
with
us
Where
then
did
he
get
all
of
this
57
So
they
began
to
stumble
because
of
him
But
Jesus
said
to
them
A
prophet
is
not
without
honor
except
in
his
home
territory
and
in
his
own
house
58
And
he
did
not
perform
many
powerful
works
there
on
account
of
their
lack
of
faith
1
At
that
time
Herod
the
district
ruler
heard
the
report
about
Jesus
2
and
said
to
his
servants
This
is
John
the
Baptist
He
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
and
this
is
why
these
powerful
works
are
operating
in
him
3
Herod
had
arrested
John
and
had
bound
him
and
imprisoned
him
because
of
Herodias
the
wife
of
Philip
his
brother
4
For
John
had
been
saying
to
him
It
is
not
lawful
for
you
to
have
her
5
However
although
he
wanted
to
kill
him
he
feared
the
crowd
because
they
took
him
for
a
prophet
6
But
when
Herods
birthday
was
being
celebrated
the
daughter
of
Herodias
danced
for
the
occasion
and
pleased
Herod
so
much
7
that
he
promised
with
an
oath
to
give
her
whatever
she
asked
8
Then
she
at
her
mothers
prompting
said
Give
me
here
on
a
platter
the
head
of
John
the
Baptist
9
Grieved
though
he
was
the
king
out
of
regard
for
his
oaths
and
for
those
dining
with
him
commanded
it
to
be
given
10
So
he
sent
and
had
John
beheaded
in
the
prison
11
His
head
was
brought
on
a
platter
and
given
to
the
girl
and
she
brought
it
to
her
mother
12
Later
his
disciples
came
and
removed
his
corpse
and
buried
him
then
they
came
and
reported
to
Jesus
13
At
hearing
this
Jesus
departed
from
there
by
boat
into
an
isolated
place
to
be
alone
But
the
crowds
getting
to
hear
of
it
followed
him
on
foot
from
the
cities
14
When
he
came
ashore
he
saw
a
large
crowd
and
he
felt
pity
for
them
and
he
cured
their
sick
ones
15
But
when
evening
fell
his
disciples
came
to
him
and
said
The
place
is
isolated
and
the
hour
is
already
late
send
the
crowds
away
so
that
they
may
go
into
the
villages
and
buy
themselves
food
16
However
Jesus
said
to
them
They
do
not
have
to
leave
you
give
them
something
to
eat
17
They
said
to
him
We
have
nothing
here
except
five
loaves
and
two
fish
18
He
said
Bring
them
here
to
me
19
And
he
instructed
the
crowds
to
recline
on
the
grass
Then
he
took
the
five
loaves
and
two
fish
and
looking
up
to
heaven
he
said
a
blessing
and
after
breaking
the
loaves
he
gave
them
to
the
disciples
and
the
disciples
gave
them
to
the
crowds
20
So
they
all
ate
and
were
satisfied
and
they
took
up
the
leftover
fragments
12
baskets
full
21
Now
those
eating
were
about
5000
men
as
well
as
women
and
young
children
22
Then
without
delay
he
made
his
disciples
board
the
boat
and
go
ahead
of
him
to
the
opposite
shore
while
he
sent
the
crowds
away
23
After
sending
the
crowds
away
he
went
up
on
the
mountain
by
himself
to
pray
When
evening
came
he
was
there
alone
24
By
now
the
boat
was
many
hundreds
of
yards
away
from
land
struggling
against
the
waves
because
the
wind
was
against
them
25
But
in
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
he
came
to
them
walking
on
the
sea
26
When
they
caught
sight
of
him
walking
on
the
sea
the
disciples
were
troubled
saying
It
is
an
apparition
And
they
cried
out
in
their
fear
27
But
at
once
Jesus
spoke
to
them
saying
Take
courage
It
is
I
do
not
be
afraid
28
Peter
answered
him
Lord
if
it
is
you
command
me
to
come
to
you
over
the
waters
29
He
said
Come
So
Peter
got
out
of
the
boat
and
walked
over
the
waters
and
went
toward
Jesus
30
But
looking
at
the
windstorm
he
became
afraid
And
when
he
started
to
sink
he
cried
out
Lord
save
me
31
Immediately
stretching
out
his
hand
Jesus
caught
hold
of
him
and
said
to
him
You
with
little
faith
why
did
you
give
way
to
doubt
32
After
they
got
up
into
the
boat
the
windstorm
abated
33
Then
those
in
the
boat
did
obeisance
to
him
saying
You
really
are
Gods
Son
34
And
they
crossed
over
and
came
to
land
in
Gennesaret
35
On
recognizing
him
the
men
of
that
place
sent
word
into
all
that
surrounding
country
and
people
brought
him
all
those
who
were
ill
36
And
they
pleaded
with
him
that
they
might
just
touch
the
fringe
of
his
outer
garment
and
all
those
who
touched
it
were
made
completely
well
1
Then
there
came
to
Jesus
from
Jerusalem
Pharisees
and
scribes
saying
2
Why
do
your
disciples
overstep
the
tradition
of
the
men
of
former
times
For
example
they
do
not
wash
their
hands
when
about
to
eat
a
meal
3
In
reply
he
said
to
them
Why
do
you
overstep
the
commandment
of
God
because
of
your
tradition
4
For
example
God
said
Honor
your
father
and
your
mother

and
Let
the
one
who
speaks
abusively
of
his
father
or
mother
be
put
to
death
5
But
you
say
Whoever
says
to
his
father
or
mother
Whatever
I
have
that
could
benefit
you
is
a
gift
dedicated
to
God

6
he
need
not
honor
his
father
at
all
So
you
have
made
the
word
of
God
invalid
because
of
your
tradition
7
You
hypocrites
Isaiah
aptly
prophesied
about
you
when
he
said
8
This
people
honor
me
with
their
lips
but
their
hearts
are
far
removed
from
me
9
It
is
in
vain
that
they
keep
worshipping
me
for
they
teach
commands
of
men
as
doctrines
10
With
that
he
called
the
crowd
near
and
said
to
them
Listen
and
get
the
sense
of
it
11
It
is
not
what
enters
into
a
mans
mouth
that
defiles
him
but
it
is
what
comes
out
of
his
mouth
that
defiles
him
12
Then
the
disciples
came
and
said
to
him
Do
you
know
that
the
Pharisees
were
stumbled
at
hearing
what
you
said
13
In
reply
he
said
Every
plant
that
my
heavenly
Father
did
not
plant
will
be
uprooted
14
Let
them
be
Blind
guides
is
what
they
are
If
then
a
blind
man
guides
a
blind
man
both
will
fall
into
a
pit
15
Peter
responded
Make
the
illustration
plain
to
us
16
At
this
he
said
Are
you
also
still
without
understanding
17
Are
you
not
aware
that
whatever
enters
into
the
mouth
passes
through
the
stomach
and
is
discharged
into
the
sewer
18
However
whatever
comes
out
of
the
mouth
comes
from
the
heart
and
those
things
defile
a
man
19
For
example
out
of
the
heart
come
wicked
reasonings
murders
adulteries
sexual
immorality
thefts
false
testimonies
blasphemies
20
These
are
the
things
that
defile
a
man
but
to
take
a
meal
with
unwashed
hands
does
not
defile
a
man
21
Leaving
there
Jesus
now
went
into
the
region
of
Tyre
and
Sidon
22
And
look
a
Phoenician
woman
from
that
region
came
and
cried
out
Have
mercy
on
me
Lord
Son
of
David
My
daughter
is
cruelly
demon
possessed
23
But
he
did
not
say
a
word
in
answer
to
her
So
his
disciples
came
and
began
to
urge
him
Send
her
away
because
she
keeps
crying
out
after
us
24
He
answered
I
was
not
sent
to
anyone
except
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
Israel
25
But
the
woman
came
and
did
obeisance
to
him
saying
Lord
help
me
26
In
answer
he
said
It
is
not
right
to
take
the
bread
of
the
children
and
throw
it
to
the
little
dogs
27
She
said
Yes
Lord
but
really
the
little
dogs
do
eat
of
the
crumbs
falling
from
the
table
of
their
masters
28
Then
Jesus
replied
to
her
O
woman
great
is
your
faith
let
it
happen
to
you
as
you
wish
And
her
daughter
was
healed
from
that
hour
on
29
Departing
from
there
Jesus
next
came
near
the
Sea
of
Galilee
and
after
going
up
on
the
mountain
he
was
sitting
there
30
Then
large
crowds
approached
him
bringing
along
people
who
were
lame
maimed
blind
speechless
and
many
others
and
they
laid
them
at
his
feet
and
he
cured
them
31
So
the
crowd
felt
amazement
as
they
saw
the
speechless
speaking
and
the
maimed
being
made
sound
and
the
lame
walking
and
the
blind
seeing
and
they
glorified
the
God
of
Israel
32
But
Jesus
called
his
disciples
to
him
and
said
I
feel
pity
for
the
crowd
because
they
have
already
stayed
with
me
for
three
days
and
they
have
had
nothing
to
eat
I
do
not
want
to
send
them
away
hungry
for
they
may
give
out
on
the
road
33
However
the
disciples
said
to
him
Where
in
this
isolated
place
are
we
going
to
get
enough
bread
to
satisfy
a
crowd
of
this
size
34
At
this
Jesus
said
to
them
How
many
loaves
do
you
have
They
said
Seven
and
a
few
small
fish
35
So
after
instructing
the
crowd
to
recline
on
the
ground
36
he
took
the
seven
loaves
and
the
fish
and
after
offering
thanks
he
broke
them
and
began
giving
them
to
the
disciples
and
the
disciples
gave
them
to
the
crowds
37
And
all
ate
and
were
satisfied
and
they
took
up
seven
large
baskets
full
of
leftover
fragments
38
Now
those
eating
were
4000
men
as
well
as
women
and
young
children
39
Finally
after
sending
the
crowds
away
he
got
into
the
boat
and
came
into
the
region
of
Magadan
1
Here
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
approached
him
and
to
test
him
they
asked
him
to
display
to
them
a
sign
from
heaven
2
In
reply
he
said
to
them
When
evening
falls
you
say
It
will
be
fair
weather
for
the
sky
is
fire-red

3
and
in
the
morning
It
will
be
wintry
rainy
weather
today
for
the
sky
is
fire-red
but
gloomy
You
know
how
to
interpret
the
appearance
of
the
sky
but
the
signs
of
the
times
you
cannot
interpret
4
A
wicked
and
adulterous
generation
keeps
seeking
a
sign
but
no
sign
will
be
given
it
except
the
sign
of
Jonah
With
that
he
went
away
leaving
them
behind
5
Now
the
disciples
crossed
to
the
other
side
and
forgot
to
take
bread
along
6
Jesus
said
to
them
Keep
your
eyes
open
and
watch
out
for
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
7
So
they
began
to
reason
among
themselves
saying
We
did
not
take
any
loaves
along
8
Knowing
this
Jesus
said
Why
are
you
discussing
among
yourselves
that
you
have
no
loaves
you
with
little
faith
9
Do
you
not
yet
see
the
point
or
do
you
not
remember
the
five
loaves
in
the
case
of
the
5000
and
how
many
baskets
you
took
up
10
Or
the
seven
loaves
in
the
case
of
the
4000
and
how
many
large
baskets
you
took
up
11
How
is
it
you
do
not
discern
that
I
did
not
speak
to
you
about
bread
But
watch
out
for
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
12
Then
they
grasped
that
he
said
to
watch
out
not
for
the
leaven
of
bread
but
for
the
teaching
of
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
13
When
he
had
come
into
the
region
of
Caesarea
Philippi
Jesus
asked
his
disciples
Who
are
men
saying
the
Son
of
man
is
14
They
said
Some
say
John
the
Baptist
others
Elijah
and
still
others
Jeremiah
or
one
of
the
prophets
15
He
said
to
them
You
though
who
do
you
say
I
am
16
Simon
Peter
answered
You
are
the
Christ
the
Son
of
the
living
God
17
In
response
Jesus
said
to
him
Happy
you
are
Simon
son
of
Jonah
because
flesh
and
blood
did
not
reveal
it
to
you
but
my
Father
in
the
heavens
did
18
Also
I
say
to
you
You
are
Peter
and
on
this
rock
I
will
build
my
congregation
and
the
gates
of
the
Grave
will
not
overpower
it
19
I
will
give
you
the
keys
of
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
and
whatever
you
may
bind
on
earth
will
already
be
bound
in
the
heavens
and
whatever
you
may
loosen
on
earth
will
already
be
loosened
in
the
heavens
20
Then
he
sternly
instructed
the
disciples
not
to
tell
anybody
that
he
was
the
Christ
21
From
that
time
forward
Jesus
began
explaining
to
his
disciples
that
he
must
go
to
Jerusalem
and
suffer
many
things
from
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
be
killed
and
on
the
third
day
be
raised
up
22
At
this
Peter
took
him
aside
and
began
to
rebuke
him
saying
Be
kind
to
yourself
Lord
you
will
not
have
this
happen
to
you
at
all
23
But
turning
his
back
he
said
to
Peter
Get
behind
me
Satan
You
are
a
stumbling
block
to
me
because
you
think
not
Gods
thoughts
but
those
of
men
24
Then
Jesus
said
to
his
disciples
If
anyone
wants
to
come
after
me
let
him
disown
himself
and
pick
up
his
torture
stake
and
keep
following
me
25
For
whoever
wants
to
save
his
life
will
lose
it
but
whoever
loses
his
life
for
my
sake
will
find
it
26
Really
what
good
will
it
do
a
man
if
he
gains
the
whole
world
but
loses
his
life
Or
what
will
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
life
27
For
the
Son
of
man
is
to
come
in
the
glory
of
his
Father
with
his
angels
and
then
he
will
repay
each
one
according
to
his
behavior
28
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
there
are
some
of
those
standing
here
who
will
not
taste
death
at
all
until
first
they
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
in
his
Kingdom
1
Six
days
later
Jesus
took
Peter
and
James
and
his
brother
John
along
and
led
them
up
into
a
lofty
mountain
by
themselves
2
And
he
was
transfigured
before
them
his
face
shone
as
the
sun
and
his
outer
garments
became
brilliant
as
the
light
3
And
look
there
appeared
to
them
Moses
and
Elijah
conversing
with
him
4
Then
Peter
said
to
Jesus
Lord
it
is
fine
for
us
to
be
here
If
you
wish
I
will
erect
three
tents
here
one
for
you
one
for
Moses
and
one
for
Elijah
5
While
he
was
still
speaking
look
a
bright
cloud
overshadowed
them
and
look
a
voice
out
of
the
cloud
said
This
is
my
Son
the
beloved
whom
I
have
approved
Listen
to
him
6
At
hearing
this
the
disciples
fell
facedown
and
became
very
much
afraid
7
Then
Jesus
came
near
and
touching
them
he
said
Get
up
Have
no
fear
8
When
they
looked
up
they
saw
no
one
but
Jesus
himself
9
As
they
were
descending
from
the
mountain
Jesus
commanded
them
Tell
the
vision
to
no
one
until
the
Son
of
man
is
raised
up
from
the
dead
10
However
the
disciples
put
the
question
to
him
Why
then
do
the
scribes
say
that
Elijah
must
come
first
11
In
reply
he
said
Elijah
is
indeed
coming
and
will
restore
all
things
12
However
I
say
to
you
that
Elijah
has
already
come
and
they
did
not
recognize
him
but
did
whatever
they
wanted
with
him
In
this
way
also
the
Son
of
man
is
going
to
suffer
at
their
hands
13
Then
the
disciples
perceived
that
he
spoke
to
them
about
John
the
Baptist
14
When
they
came
toward
the
crowd
a
man
approached
him
knelt
down
to
him
and
said
15
Lord
have
mercy
on
my
son
because
he
is
an
epileptic
and
is
ill
He
falls
often
into
the
fire
and
often
into
the
water
16
I
brought
him
to
your
disciples
but
they
could
not
cure
him
17
In
reply
Jesus
said
O
faithless
and
twisted
generation
how
long
must
I
continue
with
you
How
long
must
I
put
up
with
you
Bring
him
here
to
me
18
Then
Jesus
rebuked
the
demon
and
it
came
out
of
him
and
the
boy
was
cured
from
that
hour
19
Then
the
disciples
came
to
Jesus
privately
and
said
Why
could
we
not
expel
it
20
He
said
to
them
Because
of
your
little
faith
For
truly
I
say
to
you
if
you
have
faith
the
size
of
a
mustard
grain
you
will
say
to
this
mountain
Move
from
here
to
there

and
it
will
move
and
nothing
will
be
impossible
for
you
21
——
22
It
was
while
they
were
gathered
together
in
Galilee
that
Jesus
said
to
them
The
Son
of
man
is
going
to
be
betrayed
into
mens
hands
23
and
they
will
kill
him
and
on
the
third
day
he
will
be
raised
up
And
they
were
very
much
grieved
24
After
they
arrived
in
Capernaum
the
men
collecting
the
two
drachmas
tax
approached
Peter
and
said
Does
your
teacher
not
pay
the
two
drachmas
tax
25
He
said
Yes
However
when
he
entered
the
house
Jesus
spoke
to
him
first
and
said
What
do
you
think
Simon
From
whom
do
the
kings
of
the
earth
receive
duties
or
head
tax
From
their
sons
or
from
the
strangers
26
When
he
said
From
the
strangers

Jesus
said
to
him
Really
then
the
sons
are
tax-free
27
But
that
we
do
not
cause
them
to
stumble
go
to
the
sea
cast
a
fishhook
and
take
the
first
fish
that
comes
up
and
when
you
open
its
mouth
you
will
find
a
silver
coin
Take
that
and
give
it
to
them
for
me
and
you
1
In
that
hour
the
disciples
came
near
to
Jesus
and
said
Who
really
is
greatest
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
2
So
calling
a
young
child
to
him
he
stood
him
in
their
midst
3
and
said
Truly
I
say
to
you
unless
you
turn
around
and
become
as
young
children
you
will
by
no
means
enter
into
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
4
Therefore
whoever
will
humble
himself
like
this
young
child
is
the
one
who
is
the
greatest
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
5
and
whoever
receives
one
such
young
child
on
the
basis
of
my
name
receives
me
also
6
But
whoever
stumbles
one
of
these
little
ones
who
have
faith
in
me
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
have
hung
around
his
neck
a
millstone
that
is
turned
by
a
donkey
and
to
be
sunk
in
the
open
sea
7
Woe
to
the
world
because
of
the
stumbling
blocks
Of
course
it
is
inevitable
that
stumbling
blocks
will
come
but
woe
to
the
man
through
whom
the
stumbling
block
comes
8
If
then
your
hand
or
your
foot
makes
you
stumble
cut
it
off
and
throw
it
away
from
you
It
is
better
for
you
to
enter
into
life
maimed
or
lame
than
to
be
thrown
with
two
hands
or
two
feet
into
the
everlasting
fire
9
Also
if
your
eye
makes
you
stumble
tear
it
out
and
throw
it
away
from
you
It
is
better
for
you
to
enter
one-eyed
into
life
than
to
be
thrown
with
two
eyes
into
the
fiery
Gehenna
10
See
that
you
do
not
despise
one
of
these
little
ones
for
I
tell
you
that
their
angels
in
heaven
always
look
upon
the
face
of
my
Father
who
is
in
heaven
11
——
12
What
do
you
think
If
a
man
has
100
sheep
and
one
of
them
strays
will
he
not
leave
the
99
on
the
mountains
and
set
out
on
a
search
for
the
one
that
is
straying
13
And
if
he
finds
it
I
certainly
tell
you
he
rejoices
more
over
it
than
over
the
99
that
have
not
strayed
14
Likewise
it
is
not
a
desirable
thing
to
my
Father
who
is
in
heaven
for
even
one
of
these
little
ones
to
perish
15
Moreover
if
your
brother
commits
a
sin
go
and
reveal
his
fault
between
you
and
him
alone
If
he
listens
to
you
you
have
gained
your
brother
16
But
if
he
does
not
listen
take
along
with
you
one
or
two
more
so
that
on
the
testimony
of
two
or
three
witnesses
every
matter
may
be
established
17
If
he
does
not
listen
to
them
speak
to
the
congregation
If
he
does
not
listen
even
to
the
congregation
let
him
be
to
you
just
as
a
man
of
the
nations
and
as
a
tax
collector
18
Truly
I
say
to
you
whatever
things
you
may
bind
on
earth
will
be
things
already
bound
in
heaven
and
whatever
things
you
may
loosen
on
earth
will
be
things
already
loosened
in
heaven
19
Again
I
tell
you
truly
if
two
of
you
on
earth
agree
concerning
anything
of
importance
that
they
should
request
it
will
take
place
for
them
on
account
of
my
Father
in
heaven
20
For
where
there
are
two
or
three
gathered
together
in
my
name
there
I
am
in
their
midst
21
Then
Peter
came
and
said
to
him
Lord
how
many
times
is
my
brother
to
sin
against
me
and
am
I
to
forgive
him
Up
to
seven
times
22
Jesus
said
to
him
I
say
to
you
not
up
to
seven
times
but
up
to
77
times
23
That
is
why
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
may
be
likened
to
a
king
who
wanted
to
settle
accounts
with
his
slaves
24
When
he
started
to
settle
them
a
man
was
brought
in
who
owed
him
10000
talents
25
But
because
he
did
not
have
the
means
to
pay
it
back
his
master
ordered
him
and
his
wife
and
his
children
and
all
the
things
he
owned
to
be
sold
and
payment
to
be
made
26
So
the
slave
fell
down
and
did
obeisance
to
him
saying
Be
patient
with
me
and
I
will
pay
back
everything
to
you
27
Moved
with
pity
at
this
the
master
of
that
slave
let
him
off
and
canceled
his
debt
28
But
that
slave
went
out
and
found
one
of
his
fellow
slaves
who
owed
him
100
denarii
and
grabbed
him
and
began
to
choke
him
saying
Pay
back
whatever
you
owe
29
So
his
fellow
slave
fell
down
and
began
to
beg
him
saying
Be
patient
with
me
and
I
will
pay
you
back
30
However
he
was
not
willing
but
he
went
and
had
him
thrown
into
prison
until
he
could
pay
back
what
he
owed
31
When
his
fellow
slaves
saw
what
had
happened
they
became
greatly
distressed
and
they
went
and
reported
to
their
master
all
the
things
that
had
happened
32
Then
his
master
summoned
him
and
said
to
him
Wicked
slave
I
canceled
all
that
debt
for
you
when
you
pleaded
with
me
33
Should
you
not
also
have
shown
mercy
to
your
fellow
slave
as
I
showed
mercy
to
you
34
With
that
his
master
provoked
to
wrath
handed
him
over
to
the
jailers
until
he
repaid
all
that
he
owed
35
My
heavenly
Father
will
also
deal
with
you
in
the
same
way
if
each
of
you
does
not
forgive
your
brother
from
your
heart
1
When
Jesus
had
finished
speaking
these
things
he
departed
from
Galilee
and
came
to
the
borders
of
Judea
across
the
Jordan
2
Also
large
crowds
followed
him
and
he
cured
them
there
3
And
Pharisees
came
to
him
intent
on
testing
him
and
they
asked
Is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
divorce
his
wife
on
every
sort
of
grounds
4
In
reply
he
said
Have
you
not
read
that
the
one
who
created
them
from
the
beginning
made
them
male
and
female
5
and
said
For
this
reason
a
man
will
leave
his
father
and
his
mother
and
will
stick
to
his
wife
and
the
two
will
be
one
flesh
6
So
that
they
are
no
longer
two
but
one
flesh
Therefore
what
God
has
yoked
together
let
no
man
put
apart
7
They
said
to
him
Why
then
did
Moses
direct
giving
a
certificate
of
dismissal
and
divorcing
her
8
He
said
to
them
Out
of
regard
for
your
hard-heartedness
Moses
made
the
concession
to
you
of
divorcing
your
wives
but
that
has
not
been
the
case
from
the
beginning
9
I
say
to
you
that
whoever
divorces
his
wife
except
on
the
grounds
of
sexual
immorality
and
marries
another
commits
adultery
10
The
disciples
said
to
him
If
that
is
the
situation
of
a
man
with
his
wife
it
is
not
advisable
to
marry
11
He
said
to
them
Not
all
men
make
room
for
the
saying
but
only
those
who
have
the
gift
12
For
there
are
eunuchs
who
were
born
that
way
and
there
are
eunuchs
who
were
made
eunuchs
by
men
and
there
are
eunuchs
who
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
on
account
of
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
Let
the
one
who
can
make
room
for
it
make
room
for
it
13
Then
young
children
were
brought
to
him
for
him
to
place
his
hands
on
them
and
offer
prayer
but
the
disciples
reprimanded
them
14
Jesus
however
said
Let
the
young
children
alone
and
do
not
try
to
stop
them
from
coming
to
me
for
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
belongs
to
such
ones
15
And
he
placed
his
hands
on
them
and
departed
from
there
16
Now
look
someone
came
up
to
him
and
said
Teacher
what
good
must
I
do
to
gain
everlasting
life
17
He
said
to
him
Why
do
you
ask
me
about
what
is
good
One
there
is
who
is
good
If
though
you
want
to
enter
into
life
observe
the
commandments
continually
18
He
said
to
him
Which
ones
Jesus
said
You
must
not
murder
you
must
not
commit
adultery
you
must
not
steal
you
must
not
bear
false
witness
19
honor
your
father
and
your
mother
and
you
must
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
20
The
young
man
said
to
him
I
have
kept
all
of
these
what
am
I
still
lacking
21
Jesus
said
to
him
If
you
want
to
be
perfect
go
sell
your
belongings
and
give
to
the
poor
and
you
will
have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
be
my
follower
22
When
the
young
man
heard
this
he
went
away
grieved
for
he
had
many
possessions
23
Then
Jesus
said
to
his
disciples
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
24
Again
I
say
to
you
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
get
through
a
needles
eye
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
Kingdom
of
God
25
When
the
disciples
heard
that
they
were
greatly
astounded
saying
Who
really
can
be
saved
26
Looking
at
them
intently
Jesus
said
to
them
With
men
this
is
impossible
but
with
God
all
things
are
possible
27
Then
Peter
said
in
reply
Look
We
have
left
all
things
and
followed
you
what
then
will
there
be
for
us
28
Jesus
said
to
them
Truly
I
say
to
you
in
the
re-creation
when
the
Son
of
man
sits
down
on
his
glorious
throne
you
who
have
followed
me
will
sit
on
12
thrones
judging
the
12
tribes
of
Israel
29
And
everyone
who
has
left
houses
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
children
or
lands
for
the
sake
of
my
name
will
receive
a
hundred
times
as
much
and
will
inherit
everlasting
life
30
But
many
who
are
first
will
be
last
and
the
last
first
1
For
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
is
like
the
master
of
a
house
who
went
out
early
in
the
morning
to
hire
workers
for
his
vineyard
2
After
he
had
agreed
with
the
workers
for
a
denarius
a
day
he
sent
them
into
his
vineyard
3
Going
out
also
about
the
third
hour
he
saw
others
standing
unemployed
in
the
marketplace
4
and
to
those
he
said
You
too
go
into
the
vineyard
and
I
will
give
you
whatever
is
fair
5
So
off
they
went
Again
he
went
out
about
the
sixth
hour
and
the
ninth
hour
and
did
likewise
6
Finally
about
the
11th
hour
he
went
out
and
found
others
standing
around
and
he
said
to
them
Why
have
you
been
standing
here
all
day
unemployed
7
They
replied
Because
nobody
has
hired
us
He
said
to
them
You
too
go
into
the
vineyard
8
When
evening
came
the
master
of
the
vineyard
said
to
his
man
in
charge
Call
the
workers
and
pay
them
their
wages
starting
with
the
last
and
ending
with
the
first
9
When
the
11th-hour
men
came
they
each
received
a
denarius
10
So
when
the
first
came
they
assumed
that
they
would
receive
more
but
they
too
were
paid
at
the
rate
of
a
denarius
11
On
receiving
it
they
began
to
complain
against
the
master
of
the
house
12
and
said
These
last
men
put
in
one
hours
work
still
you
made
them
equal
to
us
who
bore
the
burden
of
the
day
and
the
burning
heat
13
But
he
said
in
reply
to
one
of
them
Fellow
I
do
you
no
wrong
You
agreed
with
me
for
a
denarius
did
you
not
14
Take
what
is
yours
and
go
I
want
to
give
to
this
last
one
the
same
as
to
you
15
Do
I
not
have
the
right
to
do
what
I
want
with
my
own
things
Or
is
your
eye
envious
because
I
am
good
16
In
this
way
the
last
ones
will
be
first
and
the
first
ones
last
17
While
going
up
to
Jerusalem
Jesus
took
the
12
disciples
aside
privately
and
said
to
them
on
the
road
18
Look
We
are
going
up
to
Jerusalem
and
the
Son
of
man
will
be
handed
over
to
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
They
will
condemn
him
to
death
19
and
hand
him
over
to
men
of
the
nations
to
be
mocked
and
scourged
and
executed
on
a
stake
and
on
the
third
day
he
will
be
raised
up
20
Then
the
mother
of
the
sons
of
Zebedee
approached
him
with
her
sons
doing
obeisance
and
asking
for
something
from
him
21
He
said
to
her
What
do
you
want
She
replied
to
him
Give
the
word
that
these
two
sons
of
mine
may
sit
down
one
at
your
right
hand
and
one
at
your
left
in
your
Kingdom
22
Jesus
answered
You
do
not
know
what
you
are
asking
for
Can
you
drink
the
cup
that
I
am
about
to
drink
They
said
to
him
We
can
23
He
said
to
them
You
will
indeed
drink
my
cup
but
to
sit
down
at
my
right
hand
and
at
my
left
is
not
mine
to
give
but
it
belongs
to
those
for
whom
it
has
been
prepared
by
my
Father
24
When
the
ten
others
heard
about
it
they
became
indignant
at
the
two
brothers
25
But
Jesus
called
them
to
him
and
said
You
know
that
the
rulers
of
the
nations
lord
it
over
them
and
the
great
men
wield
authority
over
them
26
This
must
not
be
the
way
among
you
but
whoever
wants
to
become
great
among
you
must
be
your
minister
27
and
whoever
wants
to
be
first
among
you
must
be
your
slave
28
Just
as
the
Son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
to
but
to
minister
and
to
give
his
life
as
a
ransom
in
exchange
for
many
29
As
they
were
going
out
of
Jericho
a
large
crowd
followed
him
30
And
look
two
blind
men
sitting
beside
the
road
heard
that
Jesus
was
passing
by
and
cried
out
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
Son
of
David
31
But
the
crowd
rebuked
them
telling
them
to
keep
silent
yet
they
cried
all
the
louder
saying
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
Son
of
David
32
So
Jesus
stopped
called
them
and
said
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
for
you
33
They
said
to
him
Lord
let
our
eyes
be
opened
34
Moved
with
pity
Jesus
touched
their
eyes
and
immediately
they
recovered
their
sight
and
they
followed
him
1
When
they
got
close
to
Jerusalem
and
arrived
at
Bethphage
on
the
Mount
of
Olives
then
Jesus
sent
two
disciples
2
saying
to
them
Go
into
the
village
that
is
within
sight
and
you
will
at
once
find
a
donkey
tied
and
a
colt
with
her
Untie
them
and
bring
them
to
me
3
If
someone
says
anything
to
you
you
must
say
The
Lord
needs
them
At
that
he
will
immediately
send
them
4
This
actually
took
place
to
fulfill
what
was
spoken
through
the
prophet
who
said
5
Tell
the
daughter
of
Zion
Look
Your
king
is
coming
to
you
mild-tempered
and
mounted
on
a
donkey
yes
on
a
colt
the
offspring
of
a
beast
of
burden
6
So
the
disciples
went
and
did
just
as
Jesus
had
instructed
them
7
They
brought
the
donkey
and
its
colt
and
they
put
their
outer
garments
on
them
and
he
sat
on
them
8
Most
of
the
crowd
spread
their
outer
garments
on
the
road
while
others
were
cutting
down
branches
from
the
trees
and
spreading
them
on
the
road
9
Moreover
the
crowds
going
ahead
of
him
and
those
following
him
kept
shouting
Save
we
pray
the
Son
of
David
Blessed
is
the
one
who
comes
in
Jehovahs
name
Save
him
we
pray
in
the
heights
above
10
And
when
he
entered
Jerusalem
the
whole
city
was
in
an
uproar
saying
Who
is
this
11
The
crowds
kept
saying
This
is
the
prophet
Jesus
from
Nazareth
of
Galilee
12
Jesus
entered
the
temple
and
threw
out
all
those
selling
and
buying
in
the
temple
and
he
overturned
the
tables
of
the
money
changers
and
the
benches
of
those
selling
doves
13
And
he
said
to
them
It
is
written
My
house
will
be
called
a
house
of
prayer

but
you
are
making
it
a
cave
of
robbers
14
Also
blind
and
lame
people
came
to
him
in
the
temple
and
he
cured
them
15
When
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
saw
the
marvelous
things
he
did
and
the
boys
who
were
shouting
in
the
temple
Save
we
pray
the
Son
of
David
they
became
indignant
16
and
said
to
him
Do
you
hear
what
these
are
saying
Jesus
said
to
them
Yes
Did
you
never
read
this
Out
of
the
mouth
of
children
and
infants
you
have
brought
forth
praise
17
And
leaving
them
behind
he
went
out
of
the
city
to
Bethany
and
spent
the
night
there
18
While
returning
to
the
city
early
in
the
morning
he
felt
hungry
19
He
caught
sight
of
a
fig
tree
by
the
road
and
went
to
it
but
he
found
nothing
on
it
except
leaves
and
he
said
to
it
Let
no
fruit
come
from
you
ever
again
And
the
fig
tree
withered
instantly
20
When
the
disciples
saw
this
they
were
amazed
and
said
How
is
it
that
the
fig
tree
withered
instantly
21
In
answer
Jesus
said
to
them
Truly
I
say
to
you
if
you
have
faith
and
do
not
doubt
not
only
will
you
do
what
I
did
to
the
fig
tree
but
even
if
you
say
to
this
mountain
Be
lifted
up
and
thrown
into
the
sea

it
will
happen
22
And
all
the
things
you
ask
in
prayer
having
faith
you
will
receive
23
After
he
went
into
the
temple
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
people
came
up
to
him
while
he
was
teaching
and
said
By
what
authority
do
you
do
these
things
And
who
gave
you
this
authority
24
In
reply
Jesus
said
to
them
I
will
also
ask
you
one
thing
If
you
tell
me
then
I
will
also
tell
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things
25
The
baptism
by
John
from
what
source
was
it
From
heaven
or
from
men
But
they
began
to
reason
among
themselves
saying
If
we
say
From
heaven

he
will
say
to
us
Why
then
did
you
not
believe
him
26
But
if
we
say
From
men

we
have
the
crowd
to
fear
for
they
all
regard
John
as
a
prophet
27
So
they
answered
Jesus
We
do
not
know
He
in
turn
said
to
them
Neither
am
I
telling
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things
28
What
do
you
think
A
man
had
two
children
Going
up
to
the
first
he
said
Child
go
work
today
in
the
vineyard
29
In
answer
this
one
said
I
will
not

but
afterward
he
felt
regret
and
went
out
30
Approaching
the
second
he
said
the
same
This
one
replied
I
will
Sir

but
did
not
go
out
31
Which
of
the
two
did
the
will
of
his
father
They
said
The
first
Jesus
said
to
them
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
the
tax
collectors
and
the
prostitutes
are
going
ahead
of
you
into
the
Kingdom
of
God
32
For
John
came
to
you
in
a
way
of
righteousness
but
you
did
not
believe
him
However
the
tax
collectors
and
the
prostitutes
believed
him
and
even
when
you
saw
this
you
did
not
feel
regret
afterward
so
as
to
believe
him
33
Hear
another
illustration
There
was
a
man
a
landowner
who
planted
a
vineyard
and
put
a
fence
around
it
and
dug
a
winepress
in
it
and
erected
a
tower
then
he
leased
it
to
cultivators
and
traveled
abroad
34
When
the
fruit
season
came
around
he
sent
his
slaves
to
the
cultivators
to
collect
his
fruit
35
However
the
cultivators
took
his
slaves
and
they
beat
one
up
another
they
killed
another
they
stoned
36
Again
he
sent
other
slaves
more
than
the
first
group
but
they
did
the
same
to
these
37
Lastly
he
sent
his
son
to
them
saying
They
will
respect
my
son
38
On
seeing
the
son
the
cultivators
said
among
themselves
This
is
the
heir
Come
let
us
kill
him
and
get
his
inheritance
39
So
they
took
him
and
threw
him
out
of
the
vineyard
and
killed
him
40
Therefore
when
the
owner
of
the
vineyard
comes
what
will
he
do
to
those
cultivators
41
They
said
to
him
Because
they
are
evil
he
will
bring
a
terrible
destruction
on
them
and
will
lease
the
vineyard
to
other
cultivators
who
will
give
him
the
fruits
when
they
become
due
42
Jesus
said
to
them
Did
you
never
read
in
the
Scriptures
The
stone
that
the
builders
rejected
this
has
become
the
chief
cornerstone
This
has
come
from
Jehovah
and
it
is
marvelous
in
our
eyes
43
This
is
why
I
say
to
you
the
Kingdom
of
God
will
be
taken
from
you
and
be
given
to
a
nation
producing
its
fruits
44
Also
the
person
falling
on
this
stone
will
be
shattered
As
for
anyone
on
whom
it
falls
it
will
crush
him
45
When
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
heard
his
illustrations
they
knew
that
he
was
speaking
about
them
46
Although
they
wanted
to
seize
him
they
feared
the
crowds
because
these
regarded
him
as
a
prophet
1
Once
more
Jesus
spoke
to
them
with
illustrations
saying
2
The
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
may
be
likened
to
a
king
who
made
a
marriage
feast
for
his
son
3
And
he
sent
his
slaves
to
call
those
invited
to
the
marriage
feast
but
they
were
unwilling
to
come
4
Again
he
sent
other
slaves
saying
Tell
those
invited
Look
I
have
prepared
my
dinner
my
bulls
and
fattened
animals
are
slaughtered
and
everything
is
ready
Come
to
the
marriage
feast
5
But
unconcerned
they
went
off
one
to
his
own
field
another
to
his
business
6
but
the
rest
seizing
his
slaves
treated
them
insolently
and
killed
them
7
The
king
grew
wrathful
and
sent
his
armies
and
killed
those
murderers
and
burned
their
city
8
Then
he
said
to
his
slaves
The
marriage
feast
is
ready
but
those
invited
were
not
worthy
9
Therefore
go
to
the
roads
leading
out
of
the
city
and
invite
anyone
you
find
to
the
marriage
feast
10
Accordingly
those
slaves
went
out
to
the
roads
and
gathered
all
they
found
both
wicked
and
good
and
the
room
for
the
wedding
ceremonies
was
filled
with
those
dining
11
When
the
king
came
in
to
inspect
the
guests
he
caught
sight
of
a
man
not
wearing
a
marriage
garment
12
So
he
said
to
him
Fellow
how
did
you
get
in
here
without
a
marriage
garment
He
was
speechless
13
Then
the
king
said
to
his
servants
Bind
him
hand
and
foot
and
throw
him
into
the
darkness
outside
There
is
where
his
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
his
teeth
will
be
14
For
there
are
many
invited
but
few
chosen
15
Then
the
Pharisees
went
and
conspired
together
in
order
to
trap
him
in
his
speech
16
So
they
sent
their
disciples
to
him
together
with
party
followers
of
Herod
saying
Teacher
we
know
you
are
truthful
and
teach
the
way
of
God
in
truth
and
you
do
not
seek
anyones
favor
for
you
do
not
look
at
the
outward
appearance
of
people
17
Tell
us
then
what
do
you
think
Is
it
lawful
to
pay
head
tax
to
Caesar
or
not
18
But
Jesus
knowing
their
wickedness
said
Why
do
you
put
me
to
the
test
hypocrites
19
Show
me
the
tax
coin
They
brought
him
a
denarius
20
He
said
to
them
Whose
image
and
inscription
is
this
21
They
said
Caesars
Then
he
said
to
them
Pay
back
therefore
Caesars
things
to
Caesar
but
Gods
things
to
God
22
When
they
heard
that
they
were
amazed
and
they
left
him
and
went
away
23
On
that
day
the
Sadducees
who
say
there
is
no
resurrection
came
and
asked
him
24
Teacher
Moses
said
If
any
man
dies
without
having
children
his
brother
must
marry
his
wife
and
raise
up
offspring
for
his
brother
25
Now
there
were
seven
brothers
with
us
The
first
married
and
died
and
having
no
offspring
he
left
his
wife
for
his
brother
26
The
same
thing
happened
with
the
second
and
the
third
through
all
seven
27
Last
of
all
the
woman
died
28
So
in
the
resurrection
of
the
seven
whose
wife
will
she
be
For
they
all
had
her
as
a
wife
29
In
reply
Jesus
said
to
them
You
are
mistaken
because
you
know
neither
the
Scriptures
nor
the
power
of
God
30
for
in
the
resurrection
neither
do
men
marry
nor
are
women
given
in
marriage
but
they
are
as
angels
in
heaven
31
Regarding
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
have
you
not
read
what
was
spoken
to
you
by
God
who
said
32
I
am
the
God
of
Abraham
and
the
God
of
Isaac
and
the
God
of
Jacob
He
is
the
God
not
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
33
On
hearing
that
the
crowds
were
astounded
at
his
teaching
34
After
the
Pharisees
heard
that
he
had
silenced
the
Sadducees
they
came
together
in
one
group
35
And
one
of
them
versed
in
the
Law
tested
him
by
asking
36
Teacher
which
is
the
greatest
commandment
in
the
Law
37
He
said
to
him
You
must
love
Jehovah
your
God
with
your
whole
heart
and
with
your
whole
soul
and
with
your
whole
mind
38
This
is
the
greatest
and
first
commandment
39
The
second
like
it
is
this
You
must
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
40
On
these
two
commandments
the
whole
Law
hangs
and
the
Prophets
41
Now
while
the
Pharisees
were
gathered
together
Jesus
asked
them
42
What
do
you
think
about
the
Christ
Whose
son
is
he
They
said
to
him
Davids
43
He
asked
them
How
is
it
then
that
David
under
inspiration
calls
him
Lord
saying
44
Jehovah
said
to
my
Lord
Sit
at
my
right
hand
until
I
put
your
enemies
beneath
your
feet
45
If
then
David
calls
him
Lord
how
is
he
his
son
46
And
nobody
was
able
to
say
a
word
in
reply
to
him
and
from
that
day
on
no
one
dared
to
question
him
any
further
1
Then
Jesus
spoke
to
the
crowds
and
to
his
disciples
saying
2
The
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
have
seated
themselves
in
the
seat
of
Moses
3
Therefore
all
the
things
they
tell
you
do
and
observe
but
do
not
do
according
to
their
deeds
for
they
say
but
they
do
not
practice
what
they
say
4
They
bind
up
heavy
loads
and
put
them
on
the
shoulders
of
men
but
they
themselves
are
not
willing
to
budge
them
with
their
finger
5
All
the
works
they
do
they
do
to
be
seen
by
men
for
they
broaden
the
scripture-containing
cases
that
they
wear
as
safeguards
and
lengthen
the
fringes
of
their
garments
6
They
like
the
most
prominent
place
at
evening
meals
and
the
front
seats
in
the
synagogues
7
and
the
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
to
be
called
Rabbi
by
men
8
But
you
do
not
you
be
called
Rabbi
for
one
is
your
Teacher
and
all
of
you
are
brothers
9
Moreover
do
not
call
anyone
your
father
on
earth
for
one
is
your
Father
the
heavenly
One
10
Neither
be
called
leaders
for
your
Leader
is
one
the
Christ
11
But
the
greatest
one
among
you
must
be
your
minister
12
Whoever
exalts
himself
will
be
humbled
and
whoever
humbles
himself
will
be
exalted
13
Woe
to
you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
because
you
shut
up
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
before
men
for
you
yourselves
do
not
go
in
neither
do
you
permit
those
on
their
way
in
to
go
in
14
——
15
Woe
to
you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
because
you
travel
over
sea
and
dry
land
to
make
one
proselyte
and
when
he
becomes
one
you
make
him
a
subject
for
Gehenna
twice
as
much
so
as
yourselves
16
Woe
to
you
blind
guides
who
say
If
anyone
swears
by
the
temple
it
is
nothing
but
if
anyone
swears
by
the
gold
of
the
temple
he
is
under
obligation
17
Fools
and
blind
ones
Which
in
fact
is
greater
the
gold
or
the
temple
that
has
sanctified
the
gold
18
Moreover
If
anyone
swears
by
the
altar
it
is
nothing
but
if
anyone
swears
by
the
gift
on
it
he
is
under
obligation
19
Blind
ones
Which
in
fact
is
greater
the
gift
or
the
altar
that
sanctifies
the
gift
20
Therefore
whoever
swears
by
the
altar
is
swearing
by
it
and
by
all
the
things
on
it
21
and
whoever
swears
by
the
temple
is
swearing
by
it
and
by
the
One
inhabiting
it
22
and
whoever
swears
by
heaven
is
swearing
by
the
throne
of
God
and
by
the
One
sitting
on
it
23
Woe
to
you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
because
you
give
the
tenth
of
the
mint
and
the
dill
and
the
cumin
but
you
have
disregarded
the
weightier
matters
of
the
Law
namely
justice
and
mercy
and
faithfulness
These
things
it
was
necessary
to
do
yet
not
to
disregard
the
other
things
24
Blind
guides
who
strain
out
the
gnat
but
gulp
down
the
camel
25
Woe
to
you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
because
you
cleanse
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
of
the
dish
but
inside
they
are
full
of
greediness
and
self-indulgence
26
Blind
Pharisee
cleanse
first
the
inside
of
the
cup
and
of
the
dish
so
that
the
outside
of
it
may
also
become
clean
27
Woe
to
you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
because
you
resemble
whitewashed
graves
which
outwardly
indeed
appear
beautiful
but
inside
are
full
of
dead
mens
bones
and
of
every
sort
of
uncleanness
28
In
the
same
way
on
the
outside
you
appear
righteous
to
men
but
inside
you
are
full
of
hypocrisy
and
lawlessness
29
Woe
to
you
scribes
and
Pharisees
hypocrites
because
you
build
the
graves
of
the
prophets
and
decorate
the
tombs
of
the
righteous
ones
30
and
you
say
If
we
had
lived
in
the
days
of
our
forefathers
we
would
not
have
shared
with
them
in
shedding
the
blood
of
the
prophets
31
Therefore
you
are
testifying
against
yourselves
that
you
are
sons
of
those
who
murdered
the
prophets
32
Well
then
fill
up
the
measure
of
your
forefathers
33
Serpents
offspring
of
vipers
how
will
you
flee
from
the
judgment
of
Gehenna
34
For
this
reason
I
am
sending
to
you
prophets
and
wise
men
and
public
instructors
Some
of
them
you
will
kill
and
execute
on
stakes
and
some
of
them
you
will
scourge
in
your
synagogues
and
persecute
from
city
to
city
35
so
that
there
may
come
upon
you
all
the
righteous
blood
spilled
on
earth
from
the
blood
of
righteous
Abel
to
the
blood
of
Zechariah
son
of
Barachiah
whom
you
murdered
between
the
sanctuary
and
the
altar
36
Truly
I
say
to
you
all
these
things
will
come
upon
this
generation
37
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
the
killer
of
the
prophets
and
stoner
of
those
sent
to
her—how
often
I
wanted
to
gather
your
children
together
the
way
a
hen
gathers
her
chicks
under
her
wings
But
you
did
not
want
it
38
Look
Your
house
is
abandoned
to
you
39
For
I
say
to
you
you
will
by
no
means
see
me
from
now
until
you
say
Blessed
is
the
one
who
comes
in
Jehovahs
name
1
Now
as
Jesus
was
departing
from
the
temple
his
disciples
approached
to
show
him
the
buildings
of
the
temple
2
In
response
he
said
to
them
Do
you
not
see
all
these
things
Truly
I
say
to
you
by
no
means
will
a
stone
be
left
here
upon
a
stone
and
not
be
thrown
down
3
While
he
was
sitting
on
the
Mount
of
Olives
the
disciples
approached
him
privately
saying
Tell
us
when
will
these
things
be
and
what
will
be
the
sign
of
your
presence
and
of
the
conclusion
of
the
system
of
things
4
In
answer
Jesus
said
to
them
Look
out
that
nobody
misleads
you
5
for
many
will
come
on
the
basis
of
my
name
saying
I
am
the
Christ

and
will
mislead
many
6
You
are
going
to
hear
of
wars
and
reports
of
wars
See
that
you
are
not
alarmed
for
these
things
must
take
place
but
the
end
is
not
yet
7
For
nation
will
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
there
will
be
food
shortages
and
earthquakes
in
one
place
after
another
8
All
these
things
are
a
beginning
of
pangs
of
distress
9
Then
people
will
hand
you
over
to
tribulation
and
will
kill
you
and
you
will
be
hated
by
all
the
nations
on
account
of
my
name
10
Then
too
many
will
be
stumbled
and
will
betray
one
another
and
will
hate
one
another
11
Many
false
prophets
will
arise
and
mislead
many
12
and
because
of
the
increasing
of
lawlessness
the
love
of
the
greater
number
will
grow
cold
13
But
the
one
who
has
endured
to
the
end
will
be
saved
14
And
this
good
news
of
the
Kingdom
will
be
preached
in
all
the
inhabited
earth
for
a
witness
to
all
the
nations
and
then
the
end
will
come
15
Therefore
when
you
catch
sight
of
the
disgusting
thing
that
causes
desolation
as
spoken
about
by
Daniel
the
prophet
standing
in
a
holy
place
let
the
reader
use
discernment
16
then
let
those
in
Judea
begin
fleeing
to
the
mountains
17
Let
the
man
on
the
housetop
not
come
down
to
take
the
goods
out
of
his
house
18
and
let
the
man
in
the
field
not
return
to
pick
up
his
outer
garment
19
Woe
to
the
pregnant
women
and
those
nursing
a
baby
in
those
days
20
Keep
praying
that
your
flight
may
not
occur
in
wintertime
nor
on
the
Sabbath
day
21
for
then
there
will
be
great
tribulation
such
as
has
not
occurred
since
the
worlds
beginning
until
now
no
nor
will
occur
again
22
In
fact
unless
those
days
were
cut
short
no
flesh
would
be
saved
but
on
account
of
the
chosen
ones
those
days
will
be
cut
short
23
Then
if
anyone
says
to
you
Look
Here
is
the
Christ

or
There
do
not
believe
it
24
For
false
Christs
and
false
prophets
will
arise
and
will
perform
great
signs
and
wonders
so
as
to
mislead
if
possible
even
the
chosen
ones
25
Look
I
have
forewarned
you
26
Therefore
if
people
say
to
you
Look
He
is
in
the
wilderness

do
not
go
out
Look
He
is
in
the
inner
rooms

do
not
believe
it
27
For
just
as
the
lightning
comes
out
of
the
east
and
shines
over
to
the
west
so
the
presence
of
the
Son
of
man
will
be
28
Wherever
the
carcass
is
there
the
eagles
will
be
gathered
together
29
Immediately
after
the
tribulation
of
those
days
the
sun
will
be
darkened
and
the
moon
will
not
give
its
light
and
the
stars
will
fall
from
heaven
and
the
powers
of
the
heavens
will
be
shaken
30
Then
the
sign
of
the
Son
of
man
will
appear
in
heaven
and
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
will
beat
themselves
in
grief
and
they
will
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
on
the
clouds
of
heaven
with
power
and
great
glory
31
And
he
will
send
out
his
angels
with
a
great
trumpet
sound
and
they
will
gather
his
chosen
ones
together
from
the
four
winds
from
one
extremity
of
the
heavens
to
their
other
extremity
32
Now
learn
this
illustration
from
the
fig
tree
Just
as
soon
as
its
young
branch
grows
tender
and
sprouts
its
leaves
you
know
that
summer
is
near
33
Likewise
also
you
when
you
see
all
these
things
know
that
he
is
near
at
the
doors
34
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
this
generation
will
by
no
means
pass
away
until
all
these
things
happen
35
Heaven
and
earth
will
pass
away
but
my
words
will
by
no
means
pass
away
36
Concerning
that
day
and
hour
nobody
knows
neither
the
angels
of
the
heavens
nor
the
Son
but
only
the
Father
37
For
just
as
the
days
of
Noah
were
so
the
presence
of
the
Son
of
man
will
be
38
For
as
they
were
in
those
days
before
the
Flood
eating
and
drinking
men
marrying
and
women
being
given
in
marriage
until
the
day
that
Noah
entered
into
the
ark
39
and
they
took
no
note
until
the
Flood
came
and
swept
them
all
away
so
the
presence
of
the
Son
of
man
will
be
40
Then
two
men
will
be
in
the
field
one
will
be
taken
along
and
the
other
abandoned
41
Two
women
will
be
grinding
at
the
hand
mill
one
will
be
taken
along
and
the
other
abandoned
42
Keep
on
the
watch
therefore
because
you
do
not
know
on
what
day
your
Lord
is
coming
43
But
know
one
thing
If
the
householder
had
known
in
what
watch
the
thief
was
coming
he
would
have
kept
awake
and
not
allowed
his
house
to
be
broken
into
44
On
this
account
you
too
prove
yourselves
ready
because
the
Son
of
man
is
coming
at
an
hour
that
you
do
not
think
to
be
it
45
Who
really
is
the
faithful
and
discreet
slave
whom
his
master
appointed
over
his
domestics
to
give
them
their
food
at
the
proper
time
46
Happy
is
that
slave
if
his
master
on
coming
finds
him
doing
so
47
Truly
I
say
to
you
he
will
appoint
him
over
all
his
belongings
48
But
if
ever
that
evil
slave
says
in
his
heart
My
master
is
delaying

49
and
he
starts
to
beat
his
fellow
slaves
and
to
eat
and
drink
with
the
confirmed
drunkards
50
the
master
of
that
slave
will
come
on
a
day
that
he
does
not
expect
and
in
an
hour
that
he
does
not
know
51
and
he
will
punish
him
with
the
greatest
severity
and
will
assign
him
his
place
with
the
hypocrites
There
is
where
his
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
his
teeth
will
be
1
Then
the
Kingdom
of
the
heavens
may
be
likened
to
ten
virgins
who
took
their
lamps
and
went
out
to
meet
the
bridegroom
2
Five
of
them
were
foolish
and
five
were
discreet
3
For
the
foolish
took
their
lamps
but
took
no
oil
with
them
4
whereas
the
discreet
took
oil
in
their
flasks
along
with
their
lamps
5
While
the
bridegroom
was
delaying
they
all
became
drowsy
and
fell
asleep
6
Right
in
the
middle
of
the
night
there
was
a
shout
Here
is
the
bridegroom
Go
out
to
meet
him
7
Then
all
those
virgins
got
up
and
put
their
lamps
in
order
8
The
foolish
said
to
the
discreet
Give
us
some
of
your
oil
because
our
lamps
are
about
to
go
out
9
The
discreet
answered
saying
Perhaps
there
may
not
be
enough
for
both
us
and
you
Go
instead
to
those
who
sell
it
and
buy
some
for
yourselves
10
While
they
were
going
off
to
buy
it
the
bridegroom
came
The
virgins
who
were
ready
went
in
with
him
to
the
marriage
feast
and
the
door
was
shut
11
Afterward
the
rest
of
the
virgins
also
came
saying
Sir
Sir
open
to
us
12
In
answer
he
said
I
tell
you
the
truth
I
do
not
know
you
13
Keep
on
the
watch
therefore
because
you
know
neither
the
day
nor
the
hour
14
For
it
is
just
like
a
man
about
to
travel
abroad
who
summoned
his
slaves
and
entrusted
his
belongings
to
them
15
He
gave
five
talents
to
one
two
to
another
and
one
to
still
another
to
each
according
to
his
own
ability
and
he
went
abroad
16
Immediately
the
one
who
received
the
five
talents
went
and
did
business
with
them
and
gained
five
more
17
Likewise
the
one
who
received
the
two
gained
two
more
18
But
the
slave
who
received
just
one
went
off
and
dug
in
the
ground
and
hid
his
masters
money
19
After
a
long
time
the
master
of
those
slaves
came
and
settled
accounts
with
them
20
So
the
one
who
had
received
the
five
talents
came
forward
and
brought
five
additional
talents
saying
Master
you
entrusted
five
talents
to
me
see
I
gained
five
talents
more
21
His
master
said
to
him
Well
done
good
and
faithful
slave
You
were
faithful
over
a
few
things
I
will
appoint
you
over
many
things
Enter
into
the
joy
of
your
master
22
Next
the
one
who
had
received
the
two
talents
came
forward
and
said
Master
you
entrusted
two
talents
to
me
see
I
gained
two
talents
more
23
His
master
said
to
him
Well
done
good
and
faithful
slave
You
were
faithful
over
a
few
things
I
will
appoint
you
over
many
things
Enter
into
the
joy
of
your
master
24
Finally
the
slave
who
had
received
the
one
talent
came
forward
and
said
Master
I
knew
you
to
be
a
demanding
man
reaping
where
you
did
not
sow
and
gathering
where
you
did
not
winnow
25
So
I
grew
afraid
and
went
and
hid
your
talent
in
the
ground
Here
you
have
what
is
yours
26
In
reply
his
master
said
to
him
Wicked
and
sluggish
slave
you
knew
did
you
that
I
reaped
where
I
did
not
sow
and
gathered
where
I
did
not
winnow
27
Well
then
you
should
have
deposited
my
money
with
the
bankers
and
on
my
coming
I
would
have
received
it
back
with
interest
28
Therefore
take
the
talent
away
from
him
and
give
it
to
the
one
who
has
the
ten
talents
29
For
to
everyone
who
has
more
will
be
given
and
he
will
have
an
abundance
But
the
one
who
does
not
have
even
what
he
has
will
be
taken
away
from
him
30
And
throw
the
good-for-nothing
slave
out
into
the
darkness
outside
There
is
where
his
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
his
teeth
will
be
31
When
the
Son
of
man
comes
in
his
glory
and
all
the
angels
with
him
then
he
will
sit
down
on
his
glorious
throne
32
All
the
nations
will
be
gathered
before
him
and
he
will
separate
people
one
from
another
just
as
a
shepherd
separates
the
sheep
from
the
goats
33
And
he
will
put
the
sheep
on
his
right
hand
but
the
goats
on
his
left
34
Then
the
King
will
say
to
those
on
his
right
Come
you
who
have
been
blessed
by
my
Father
inherit
the
Kingdom
prepared
for
you
from
the
founding
of
the
world
35
For
I
became
hungry
and
you
gave
me
something
to
eat
I
was
thirsty
and
you
gave
me
something
to
drink
I
was
a
stranger
and
you
received
me
hospitably
36
naked
and
you
clothed
me
I
fell
sick
and
you
looked
after
me
I
was
in
prison
and
you
visited
me
37
Then
the
righteous
ones
will
answer
him
with
the
words
Lord
when
did
we
see
you
hungry
and
feed
you
or
thirsty
and
give
you
something
to
drink
38
When
did
we
see
you
a
stranger
and
receive
you
hospitably
or
naked
and
clothe
you
39
When
did
we
see
you
sick
or
in
prison
and
visit
you
40
In
reply
the
King
will
say
to
them
Truly
I
say
to
you
to
the
extent
that
you
did
it
to
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brothers
you
did
it
to
me
41
Then
he
will
say
to
those
on
his
left
Go
away
from
me
you
who
have
been
cursed
into
the
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
Devil
and
his
angels
42
For
I
became
hungry
but
you
gave
me
nothing
to
eat
and
I
was
thirsty
but
you
gave
me
nothing
to
drink
43
I
was
a
stranger
but
you
did
not
receive
me
hospitably
naked
but
you
did
not
clothe
me
sick
and
in
prison
but
you
did
not
look
after
me
44
Then
they
too
will
answer
with
the
words
Lord
when
did
we
see
you
hungry
or
thirsty
or
a
stranger
or
naked
or
sick
or
in
prison
and
did
not
minister
to
you
45
Then
he
will
answer
them
saying
Truly
I
say
to
you
to
the
extent
that
you
did
not
do
it
to
one
of
these
least
ones
you
did
not
do
it
to
me
46
These
will
depart
into
everlasting
cutting-off
but
the
righteous
ones
into
everlasting
life
1
Now
when
Jesus
had
finished
saying
all
these
things
he
said
to
his
disciples
2
You
know
that
two
days
from
now
the
Passover
takes
place
and
the
Son
of
man
will
be
handed
over
to
be
executed
on
the
stake
3
Then
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
people
gathered
in
the
courtyard
of
the
high
priest
who
was
named
Caiaphas
4
and
they
conspired
together
to
seize
Jesus
by
cunning
and
to
kill
him
5
However
they
were
saying
Not
at
the
festival
so
that
there
may
not
be
an
uproar
among
the
people
6
While
Jesus
was
in
Bethany
in
the
house
of
Simon
the
leper
7
a
woman
with
an
alabaster
jar
of
costly
perfumed
oil
approached
him
and
she
began
pouring
it
on
his
head
as
he
was
dining
8
On
seeing
this
the
disciples
became
indignant
and
said
Why
this
waste
9
For
this
could
have
been
sold
for
a
great
deal
of
money
and
given
to
the
poor
10
Aware
of
this
Jesus
said
to
them
Why
do
you
try
to
make
trouble
for
the
woman
She
did
a
fine
deed
toward
me
11
For
you
always
have
the
poor
with
you
but
you
will
not
always
have
me
12
When
she
put
this
perfumed
oil
on
my
body
she
did
it
to
prepare
me
for
burial
13
Truly
I
say
to
you
wherever
this
good
news
is
preached
in
all
the
world
what
this
woman
did
will
also
be
told
in
memory
of
her
14
Then
one
of
the
Twelve
the
one
called
Judas
Iscariot
went
to
the
chief
priests
15
and
said
What
will
you
give
me
to
betray
him
to
you
They
stipulated
to
him
30
silver
pieces
16
So
from
then
on
he
kept
looking
for
a
good
opportunity
to
betray
him
17
On
the
first
day
of
the
Unleavened
Bread
the
disciples
came
to
Jesus
saying
Where
do
you
want
us
to
prepare
for
you
to
eat
the
Passover
18
He
said
Go
into
the
city
to
So-and-so
and
say
to
him
The
Teacher
says
My
appointed
time
is
near
I
will
celebrate
the
Passover
with
my
disciples
at
your
home
19
So
the
disciples
did
as
Jesus
instructed
them
and
prepared
for
the
Passover
20
When
evening
came
he
was
reclining
at
the
table
with
the
12
disciples
21
While
they
were
eating
he
said
Truly
I
say
to
you
one
of
you
will
betray
me
22
Being
very
much
grieved
at
this
each
and
every
one
began
to
say
to
him
Lord
it
is
not
I
is
it
23
In
reply
he
said
The
one
who
dips
his
hand
with
me
into
the
bowl
is
the
one
who
will
betray
me
24
True
the
Son
of
man
is
going
away
just
as
it
is
written
about
him
but
woe
to
that
man
through
whom
the
Son
of
man
is
betrayed
It
would
have
been
better
for
that
man
if
he
had
not
been
born
25
Judas
who
was
about
to
betray
him
replied
It
is
not
I
is
it
Rabbi
Jesus
said
to
him
You
yourself
said
it
26
As
they
continued
eating
Jesus
took
a
loaf
and
after
saying
a
blessing
he
broke
it
and
giving
it
to
the
disciples
he
said
Take
eat
This
means
my
body
27
And
taking
a
cup
he
offered
thanks
and
gave
it
to
them
saying
Drink
out
of
it
all
of
you
28
for
this
means
my
blood
of
the
covenant

which
is
to
be
poured
out
in
behalf
of
many
for
forgiveness
of
sins
29
But
I
say
to
you
I
will
by
no
means
drink
again
any
of
this
product
of
the
vine
until
that
day
when
I
drink
it
new
with
you
in
the
Kingdom
of
my
Father
30
Finally
after
singing
praises
they
went
out
to
the
Mount
of
Olives
31
Then
Jesus
said
to
them
All
of
you
will
be
stumbled
in
connection
with
me
on
this
night
for
it
is
written
I
will
strike
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
of
the
flock
will
be
scattered
about
32
But
after
I
have
been
raised
up
I
will
go
ahead
of
you
into
Galilee
33
But
Peter
in
response
said
to
him
Although
all
the
others
are
stumbled
in
connection
with
you
I
will
never
be
stumbled
34
Jesus
said
to
him
Truly
I
say
to
you
on
this
night
before
a
rooster
crows
you
will
disown
me
three
times
35
Peter
said
to
him
Even
if
I
should
have
to
die
with
you
I
will
by
no
means
disown
you
All
the
other
disciples
also
said
the
same
thing
36
Then
Jesus
came
with
them
to
the
spot
called
Gethsemane
and
he
said
to
the
disciples
Sit
down
here
while
I
go
over
there
and
pray
37
And
taking
along
Peter
and
the
two
sons
of
Zebedee
he
began
to
feel
grieved
and
to
be
greatly
troubled
38
Then
he
said
to
them
I
am
deeply
grieved
even
to
death
Stay
here
and
keep
on
the
watch
with
me
39
And
going
a
little
way
forward
he
fell
facedown
praying
My
Father
if
it
is
possible
let
this
cup
pass
away
from
me
Yet
not
as
I
will
but
as
you
will
40
He
returned
to
the
disciples
and
found
them
sleeping
and
he
said
to
Peter
Could
you
not
so
much
as
keep
on
the
watch
for
one
hour
with
me
41
Keep
on
the
watch
and
pray
continually
so
that
you
may
not
enter
into
temptation
The
spirit
of
course
is
eager
but
the
flesh
is
weak
42
Again
a
second
time
he
went
off
and
prayed
My
Father
if
it
is
not
possible
for
this
to
pass
away
unless
I
drink
it
let
your
will
take
place
43
And
he
came
again
and
found
them
sleeping
for
their
eyes
were
heavy
44
So
leaving
them
he
again
went
off
and
prayed
for
a
third
time
saying
once
more
the
same
thing
45
Then
he
returned
to
the
disciples
and
said
to
them
At
such
a
time
as
this
you
are
sleeping
and
resting
Look
The
hour
has
drawn
near
for
the
Son
of
man
to
be
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
sinners
46
Get
up
let
us
go
Look
My
betrayer
has
drawn
near
47
While
he
was
still
speaking
look
Judas
one
of
the
Twelve
came
and
with
him
a
large
crowd
with
swords
and
clubs
sent
from
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
people
48
Now
his
betrayer
had
given
them
a
sign
saying
Whoever
it
is
I
kiss
he
is
the
one
take
him
into
custody
49
And
going
straight
up
to
Jesus
he
said
Greetings
Rabbi
and
gave
him
a
tender
kiss
50
But
Jesus
said
to
him
Fellow
for
what
purpose
are
you
present
Then
they
came
forward
and
seized
Jesus
and
took
him
into
custody
51
But
look
one
of
those
with
Jesus
reached
out
his
hand
and
drew
his
sword
and
struck
the
slave
of
the
high
priest
taking
off
his
ear
52
Then
Jesus
said
to
him
Return
your
sword
to
its
place
for
all
those
who
take
up
the
sword
will
perish
by
the
sword
53
Or
do
you
think
that
I
cannot
appeal
to
my
Father
to
supply
me
at
this
moment
more
than
12
legions
of
angels
54
In
that
case
how
would
the
Scriptures
be
fulfilled
that
say
it
must
take
place
this
way
55
In
that
hour
Jesus
said
to
the
crowds
Did
you
come
out
to
arrest
me
with
swords
and
clubs
as
against
a
robber
Day
after
day
I
used
to
sit
in
the
temple
teaching
and
yet
you
did
not
take
me
into
custody
56
But
all
of
this
has
taken
place
for
the
writings
of
the
prophets
to
be
fulfilled
Then
all
the
disciples
abandoned
him
and
fled
57
Those
who
took
Jesus
into
custody
led
him
away
to
Caiaphas
the
high
priest
where
the
scribes
and
the
elders
were
gathered
together
58
But
Peter
kept
following
him
from
a
good
distance
as
far
as
the
courtyard
of
the
high
priest
and
after
going
inside
he
sat
with
the
house
attendants
to
see
the
outcome
59
Now
the
chief
priests
and
the
entire
Sanhedrin
were
looking
for
false
testimony
against
Jesus
in
order
to
put
him
to
death
60
But
they
found
none
although
many
false
witnesses
came
forward
Later
two
came
forward
61
and
said
This
man
said
I
am
able
to
throw
down
the
temple
of
God
and
build
it
up
in
three
days
62
With
that
the
high
priest
stood
up
and
said
to
him
Do
you
say
nothing
in
reply
What
is
it
these
men
are
testifying
against
you
63
But
Jesus
kept
silent
So
the
high
priest
said
to
him
I
put
you
under
oath
by
the
living
God
to
tell
us
whether
you
are
the
Christ
the
Son
of
God
64
Jesus
said
to
him
You
yourself
said
it
But
I
say
to
you
From
now
on
you
will
see
the
Son
of
man
sitting
at
the
right
hand
of
power
and
coming
on
the
clouds
of
heaven
65
Then
the
high
priest
ripped
his
outer
garments
saying
He
has
blasphemed
What
further
need
do
we
have
of
witnesses
See
Now
you
have
heard
the
blasphemy
66
What
is
your
opinion
They
answered
He
deserves
to
die
67
Then
they
spat
in
his
face
and
hit
him
with
their
fists
Others
slapped
him
on
the
face
68
saying
Prophesy
to
us
you
Christ
Who
struck
you
69
Now
Peter
was
sitting
outside
in
the
courtyard
and
a
servant
girl
came
up
to
him
and
said
You
too
were
with
Jesus
the
Galilean
70
But
he
denied
it
before
them
all
saying
I
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
71
When
he
went
out
to
the
gatehouse
another
girl
noticed
him
and
said
to
those
there
This
man
was
with
Jesus
the
Nazarene
72
Again
he
denied
it
with
an
oath
I
do
not
know
the
man
73
After
a
little
while
those
standing
around
came
up
and
said
to
Peter
Certainly
you
are
also
one
of
them
for
in
fact
your
dialect
gives
you
away
74
Then
he
started
to
curse
and
swear
I
do
not
know
the
man
And
immediately
a
rooster
crowed
75
And
Peter
called
to
mind
what
Jesus
had
said
namely
Before
a
rooster
crows
you
will
disown
me
three
times
And
he
went
outside
and
wept
bitterly
1
When
morning
came
all
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
people
consulted
together
against
Jesus
to
put
him
to
death
2
After
binding
him
they
led
him
off
and
handed
him
over
to
Pilate
the
governor
3
Then
Judas
his
betrayer
seeing
that
Jesus
had
been
condemned
felt
remorse
and
brought
the
30
pieces
of
silver
back
to
the
chief
priests
and
elders
4
saying
I
sinned
when
I
betrayed
innocent
blood
They
said
What
is
that
to
us
You
must
see
to
it
5
So
he
threw
the
silver
pieces
into
the
temple
and
departed
Then
he
went
off
and
hanged
himself
6
But
the
chief
priests
took
the
silver
pieces
and
said
It
is
not
lawful
to
put
them
into
the
sacred
treasury
because
they
are
the
price
of
blood
7
After
consulting
together
they
used
the
money
to
buy
the
potters
field
as
a
burial
place
for
strangers
8
Therefore
that
field
has
been
called
Field
of
Blood
to
this
very
day
9
Then
what
was
spoken
through
Jeremiah
the
prophet
was
fulfilled
And
they
took
the
30
silver
pieces
the
price
that
was
set
on
the
man
the
one
on
whom
a
price
was
set
by
some
of
the
sons
of
Israel
10
and
they
gave
them
for
the
potters
field
according
to
what
Jehovah
had
commanded
me
11
Jesus
now
stood
before
the
governor
and
the
governor
put
the
question
to
him
Are
you
the
King
of
the
Jews
Jesus
replied
You
yourself
say
it
12
But
while
he
was
being
accused
by
the
chief
priests
and
elders
he
made
no
answer
13
Then
Pilate
said
to
him
Do
you
not
hear
how
many
things
they
are
testifying
against
you
14
But
he
did
not
answer
him
no
not
a
word
so
that
the
governor
was
very
surprised
15
Now
from
festival
to
festival
it
was
the
custom
of
the
governor
to
release
a
prisoner
to
the
crowd
whomever
they
wanted
16
Just
at
that
time
they
were
holding
a
notorious
prisoner
called
Barabbas
17
So
when
they
were
gathered
together
Pilate
said
to
them
Which
one
do
you
want
me
to
release
to
you
Barabbas
or
Jesus
the
so-called
Christ
18
For
Pilate
was
aware
that
out
of
envy
they
had
handed
him
over
19
Moreover
while
he
was
sitting
on
the
judgment
seat
his
wife
sent
a
message
to
him
saying
Have
nothing
to
do
with
that
righteous
man
for
I
suffered
a
lot
today
in
a
dream
because
of
him
20
But
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
persuaded
the
crowds
to
ask
for
Barabbas
but
to
have
Jesus
put
to
death
21
In
response
the
governor
said
to
them
Which
of
the
two
do
you
want
me
to
release
to
you
They
said
Barabbas
22
Pilate
said
to
them
What
then
should
I
do
with
Jesus
the
so-called
Christ
They
all
said
To
the
stake
with
him
23
He
said
Why
What
bad
thing
did
he
do
Still
they
kept
shouting
out
all
the
more
To
the
stake
with
him
24
Seeing
that
it
did
no
good
but
rather
an
uproar
was
arising
Pilate
took
water
and
washed
his
hands
before
the
crowd
saying
I
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
man
You
yourselves
must
see
to
it
25
At
that
all
the
people
said
in
answer
Let
his
blood
come
upon
us
and
upon
our
children
26
Then
he
released
Barabbas
to
them
but
he
had
Jesus
whipped
and
handed
him
over
to
be
executed
on
the
stake
27
Then
the
soldiers
of
the
governor
took
Jesus
into
the
governors
residence
and
gathered
the
whole
body
of
troops
together
around
him
28
And
disrobing
him
they
draped
him
with
a
scarlet
cloak
29
and
they
braided
a
crown
out
of
thorns
and
put
it
on
his
head
and
put
a
reed
in
his
right
hand
And
kneeling
before
him
they
mocked
him
saying
Greetings
you
King
of
the
Jews
30
And
they
spat
on
him
and
took
the
reed
and
began
hitting
him
on
his
head
31
Finally
after
they
had
mocked
him
they
stripped
him
of
the
cloak
and
put
his
outer
garments
on
him
and
led
him
off
to
be
nailed
to
the
stake
32
As
they
were
going
out
they
found
a
man
of
Cyrene
named
Simon
This
man
they
compelled
into
service
to
carry
his
torture
stake
33
And
when
they
came
to
a
place
called
Golgotha
that
is
Skull
Place
34
they
gave
him
wine
mixed
with
gall
to
drink
but
after
tasting
it
he
refused
to
drink
it
35
When
they
had
nailed
him
to
the
stake
they
distributed
his
outer
garments
by
casting
lots
36
and
they
sat
there
keeping
watch
over
him
37
They
also
posted
above
his
head
the
charge
against
him
in
writing
This
is
Jesus
the
King
of
the
Jews
38
Then
two
robbers
were
put
on
stakes
alongside
him
one
on
his
right
and
one
on
his
left
39
And
those
passing
by
spoke
abusively
of
him
shaking
their
heads
40
and
saying
You
who
would
throw
down
the
temple
and
build
it
in
three
days
save
yourself
If
you
are
a
son
of
God
come
down
off
the
torture
stake
41
In
the
same
way
also
the
chief
priests
with
the
scribes
and
the
elders
began
mocking
him
saying
42
Others
he
saved
himself
he
cannot
save
He
is
King
of
Israel
let
him
now
come
down
off
the
torture
stake
and
we
will
believe
in
him
43
He
has
put
his
trust
in
God
let
Him
now
rescue
him
if
He
wants
him
for
he
said
I
am
Gods
Son
44
In
the
same
way
even
the
robbers
who
were
on
stakes
alongside
him
were
reproaching
him
45
From
the
sixth
hour
on
a
darkness
fell
over
all
the
land
until
the
ninth
hour
46
About
the
ninth
hour
Jesus
called
out
with
a
loud
voice
saying
Eli
Eli
lama
sabachthani
that
is
My
God
my
God
why
have
you
forsaken
me
47
At
hearing
this
some
of
those
standing
there
began
to
say
This
man
is
calling
Elijah
48
And
immediately
one
of
them
ran
and
took
a
sponge
and
soaked
it
in
sour
wine
and
put
it
on
a
reed
and
gave
it
to
him
to
drink
49
But
the
rest
of
them
said
Let
him
be
Let
us
see
whether
Elijah
comes
to
save
him
50
Again
Jesus
called
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
yielded
up
his
spirit
51
And
look
the
curtain
of
the
sanctuary
was
torn
in
two
from
top
to
bottom
and
the
earth
quaked
and
the
rocks
were
split
52
And
the
tombs
were
opened
and
many
bodies
of
the
holy
ones
who
had
fallen
asleep
were
raised
up
53
and
people
coming
out
from
among
the
tombs
after
his
being
raised
up
entered
into
the
holy
city
and
they
became
visible
to
many
people
54
But
when
the
army
officer
and
those
with
him
keeping
watch
over
Jesus
saw
the
earthquake
and
the
things
happening
they
grew
very
much
afraid
and
said
Certainly
this
was
Gods
Son
55
And
many
women
were
there
watching
from
a
distance
who
had
accompanied
Jesus
from
Galilee
to
minister
to
him
56
among
them
were
Mary
Magdalene
and
Mary
the
mother
of
James
and
Joses
and
the
mother
of
the
sons
of
Zebedee
57
Now
as
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
a
rich
man
of
Arimathea
came
named
Joseph
who
had
also
become
a
disciple
of
Jesus
58
This
man
approached
Pilate
and
asked
for
the
body
of
Jesus
Then
Pilate
commanded
that
it
be
given
to
him
59
Joseph
took
the
body
wrapped
it
up
in
clean
fine
linen
60
and
laid
it
in
his
new
tomb
which
he
had
quarried
in
the
rock
And
after
rolling
a
big
stone
to
the
entrance
of
the
tomb
he
left
61
But
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
other
Mary
continued
there
sitting
before
the
grave
62
The
next
day
which
was
after
the
Preparation
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
gathered
together
before
Pilate
63
saying
Sir
we
recall
what
that
impostor
said
while
he
was
still
alive
After
three
days
I
am
to
be
raised
up
64
Therefore
command
that
the
grave
be
made
secure
until
the
third
day
so
that
his
disciples
may
not
come
and
steal
him
and
say
to
the
people
He
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
Then
this
last
deception
will
be
worse
than
the
first
65
Pilate
said
to
them
You
may
have
a
guard
Go
make
it
as
secure
as
you
know
how
66
So
they
went
and
made
the
grave
secure
by
sealing
the
stone
and
posting
a
guard
1
After
the
Sabbath
when
it
was
growing
light
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
Mary
Magdalene
and
the
other
Mary
came
to
view
the
grave
2
And
look
a
great
earthquake
had
taken
place
for
Jehovahs
angel
had
descended
from
heaven
and
had
come
and
rolled
away
the
stone
and
he
was
sitting
on
it
3
His
appearance
was
like
lightning
and
his
clothing
was
as
white
as
snow
4
Yes
out
of
their
fear
of
him
the
watchmen
trembled
and
became
as
dead
men
5
But
the
angel
said
to
the
women
Do
not
be
afraid
for
I
know
that
you
are
looking
for
Jesus
who
was
executed
on
the
stake
6
He
is
not
here
for
he
was
raised
up
just
as
he
said
Come
see
the
place
where
he
was
lying
7
Then
go
quickly
and
tell
his
disciples
that
he
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
for
look
he
is
going
ahead
of
you
into
Galilee
You
will
see
him
there
Look
I
have
told
you
8
So
quickly
leaving
the
memorial
tomb
with
fear
and
great
joy
they
ran
to
report
to
his
disciples
9
And
look
Jesus
met
them
and
said
Good
day
They
approached
and
took
hold
of
his
feet
and
did
obeisance
to
him
10
Then
Jesus
said
to
them
Have
no
fear
Go
report
to
my
brothers
so
that
they
may
go
to
Galilee
and
there
they
will
see
me
11
While
they
were
on
their
way
some
of
the
guards
went
into
the
city
and
reported
to
the
chief
priests
all
the
things
that
had
happened
12
And
after
these
had
gathered
with
the
elders
and
had
consulted
together
they
gave
a
considerable
number
of
silver
pieces
to
the
soldiers
13
and
said
Say
His
disciples
came
in
the
night
and
stole
him
while
we
were
sleeping
14
And
if
this
gets
to
the
governors
ears
we
will
explain
the
matter
to
him
and
you
will
not
need
to
worry
15
So
they
took
the
silver
pieces
and
did
as
they
were
instructed
and
this
story
has
been
spread
abroad
among
the
Jews
up
to
this
very
day
16
However
the
11
disciples
went
to
Galilee
to
the
mountain
where
Jesus
had
arranged
for
them
to
meet
17
When
they
saw
him
they
did
obeisance
but
some
doubted
18
Jesus
approached
and
spoke
to
them
saying
All
authority
has
been
given
me
in
heaven
and
on
the
earth
19
Go
therefore
and
make
disciples
of
people
of
all
the
nations
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of
the
Father
and
of
the
Son
and
of
the
holy
spirit
20
teaching
them
to
observe
all
the
things
I
have
commanded
you
And
look
I
am
with
you
all
the
days
until
the
conclusion
of
the
system
of
things
1
The
beginning
of
the
good
news
about
Jesus
Christ
the
Son
of
God
2
Just
as
it
is
written
in
Isaiah
the
prophet
Look
I
am
sending
my
messenger
ahead
of
you
who
will
prepare
your
way
3
A
voice
of
one
crying
out
in
the
wilderness
Prepare
the
way
of
Jehovah
Make
his
roads
straight
4
John
the
Baptizer
was
in
the
wilderness
preaching
baptism
in
symbol
of
repentance
for
forgiveness
of
sins
5
And
all
the
territory
of
Judea
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
were
going
out
to
him
and
they
were
baptized
by
him
in
the
Jordan
River
openly
confessing
their
sins
6
Now
John
wore
clothing
of
camels
hair
and
a
leather
belt
around
his
waist
and
he
ate
locusts
and
wild
honey
7
And
he
was
preaching
Someone
stronger
than
I
am
is
coming
after
me
the
lace
of
whose
sandals
I
am
not
worthy
to
stoop
down
and
untie
8
I
baptized
you
with
water
but
he
will
baptize
you
with
holy
spirit
9
In
the
course
of
those
days
Jesus
came
from
Nazareth
of
Galilee
and
was
baptized
in
the
Jordan
by
John
10
And
immediately
on
coming
up
out
of
the
water
he
saw
the
heavens
being
parted
and
like
a
dove
the
spirit
coming
down
upon
him
11
And
a
voice
came
out
of
the
heavens
You
are
my
Son
the
beloved
I
have
approved
you
12
And
immediately
the
spirit
impelled
him
to
go
into
the
wilderness
13
So
he
continued
in
the
wilderness
for
40
days
being
tempted
by
Satan
He
was
with
the
wild
beasts
but
the
angels
were
ministering
to
him
14
Now
after
John
was
arrested
Jesus
went
into
Galilee
preaching
the
good
news
of
God
15
and
saying
The
appointed
time
has
been
fulfilled
and
the
Kingdom
of
God
has
drawn
near
Repent
and
have
faith
in
the
good
news
16
While
walking
alongside
the
Sea
of
Galilee
he
saw
Simon
and
Simons
brother
Andrew
casting
their
nets
into
the
sea
for
they
were
fishermen
17
So
Jesus
said
to
them
Come
after
me
and
I
will
make
you
fishers
of
men
18
And
at
once
they
abandoned
their
nets
and
followed
him
19
After
going
a
little
farther
he
saw
James
the
son
of
Zebedee
and
his
brother
John
while
they
were
in
their
boat
mending
their
nets
20
and
without
delay
he
called
them
So
they
left
their
father
Zebedee
in
the
boat
with
the
hired
men
and
went
off
after
him
21
And
they
went
into
Capernaum
As
soon
as
the
Sabbath
began
he
went
into
the
synagogue
and
started
to
teach
22
And
they
were
astounded
at
his
way
of
teaching
for
he
was
teaching
them
as
one
having
authority
and
not
as
the
scribes
23
Just
then
there
was
a
man
in
their
synagogue
who
was
under
the
power
of
an
unclean
spirit
and
he
shouted
24
What
have
we
to
do
with
you
Jesus
the
Nazarene
Did
you
come
to
destroy
us
I
know
exactly
who
you
are
the
Holy
One
of
God
25
But
Jesus
rebuked
it
saying
Be
silent
and
come
out
of
him
26
And
the
unclean
spirit
after
throwing
the
man
into
a
convulsion
and
yelling
at
the
top
of
its
voice
came
out
of
him
27
Well
the
people
were
all
so
astonished
that
they
began
to
discuss
it
among
themselves
saying
What
is
this
A
new
teaching
He
authoritatively
orders
even
the
unclean
spirits
and
they
obey
him
28
So
the
report
about
him
spread
quickly
in
all
directions
throughout
the
entire
region
of
Galilee
29
At
that
they
left
the
synagogue
and
went
to
the
home
of
Simon
and
Andrew
with
James
and
John
30
Now
Simons
mother-in-law
was
lying
down
sick
with
a
fever
and
they
at
once
told
him
about
her
31
Going
to
her
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
raised
her
up
The
fever
left
her
and
she
began
ministering
to
them
32
After
evening
had
fallen
when
the
sun
had
set
the
people
began
bringing
to
him
all
who
were
ill
and
demon
possessed
33
and
the
whole
city
was
gathered
right
at
the
door
34
So
he
cured
many
who
were
ill
with
various
sicknesses
and
he
expelled
many
demons
but
he
would
not
let
the
demons
speak
for
they
knew
him
to
be
Christ
35
Early
in
the
morning
while
it
was
still
dark
he
got
up
and
went
outside
and
left
for
an
isolated
place
and
there
he
began
praying
36
However
Simon
and
those
with
him
hunted
him
down
37
and
found
him
and
they
said
to
him
Everyone
is
looking
for
you
38
But
he
said
to
them
Let
us
go
somewhere
else
into
the
towns
nearby
so
that
I
may
preach
there
also
for
this
is
why
I
have
come
39
And
he
went
preaching
in
their
synagogues
throughout
the
whole
of
Galilee
and
expelling
the
demons
40
There
also
came
to
him
a
leper
pleading
with
him
even
on
bended
knee
saying
to
him
If
you
just
want
to
you
can
make
me
clean
41
At
that
he
was
moved
with
pity
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
touched
him
and
said
to
him
I
want
to
Be
made
clean
42
Immediately
the
leprosy
vanished
from
him
and
he
became
clean
43
Then
he
gave
him
strict
orders
and
at
once
sent
him
away
44
saying
to
him
See
that
you
say
nothing
to
anyone
but
go
show
yourself
to
the
priest
and
offer
for
your
cleansing
the
things
Moses
directed
for
a
witness
to
them
45
But
after
going
away
the
man
started
to
proclaim
it
a
great
deal
and
to
spread
the
account
widely
so
that
Jesus
was
no
longer
able
to
enter
openly
into
a
city
but
he
stayed
outside
in
isolated
places
Yet
they
kept
coming
to
him
from
all
sides
1
However
after
some
days
he
again
entered
into
Capernaum
and
the
word
spread
that
he
was
at
home
2
And
so
many
gathered
that
there
was
no
more
room
not
even
around
the
door
and
he
began
to
speak
the
word
to
them
3
And
they
brought
him
a
paralytic
carried
by
four
men
4
But
they
could
not
bring
him
right
to
Jesus
because
of
the
crowd
so
they
removed
the
roof
above
Jesus
and
after
digging
an
opening
they
lowered
the
stretcher
on
which
the
paralytic
was
lying
5
When
Jesus
saw
their
faith
he
said
to
the
paralytic
Child
your
sins
are
forgiven
6
Now
some
of
the
scribes
were
there
sitting
and
reasoning
in
their
hearts
7
Why
is
this
man
talking
this
way
He
is
blaspheming
Who
can
forgive
sins
except
one
God
8
But
immediately
Jesus
discerned
by
his
spirit
that
they
were
reasoning
that
way
among
themselves
so
he
said
to
them
Why
are
you
reasoning
these
things
in
your
hearts
9
Which
is
easier
to
say
to
the
paralytic
Your
sins
are
forgiven

or
to
say
Get
up
and
pick
up
your
stretcher
and
walk
10
But
in
order
for
you
to
know
that
the
Son
of
man
has
authority
to
forgive
sins
on
earth—
he
said
to
the
paralytic
11
I
say
to
you
Get
up
pick
up
your
stretcher
and
go
to
your
home
12
At
that
he
got
up
and
immediately
picked
up
his
stretcher
and
walked
out
in
front
of
them
all
So
they
were
all
astonished
and
they
glorified
God
saying
We
have
never
seen
anything
like
this
13
Again
he
went
out
alongside
the
sea
and
all
the
crowd
kept
coming
to
him
and
he
began
to
teach
them
14
And
as
he
was
passing
by
he
caught
sight
of
Levi
the
son
of
Alphaeus
sitting
at
the
tax
office
and
he
said
to
him
Be
my
follower
At
that
he
rose
up
and
followed
him
15
Later
he
was
dining
in
his
house
and
many
tax
collectors
and
sinners
were
dining
with
Jesus
and
his
disciples
for
there
were
many
of
them
who
were
following
him
16
But
when
the
scribes
of
the
Pharisees
saw
that
he
was
eating
with
the
sinners
and
tax
collectors
they
began
saying
to
his
disciples
Does
he
eat
with
tax
collectors
and
sinners
17
On
hearing
this
Jesus
said
to
them
Those
who
are
strong
do
not
need
a
physician
but
those
who
are
ill
do
I
came
to
call
not
righteous
people
but
sinners
18
Now
Johns
disciples
and
the
Pharisees
practiced
fasting
So
they
came
and
said
to
him
Why
do
Johns
disciples
and
the
disciples
of
the
Pharisees
practice
fasting
but
your
disciples
do
not
practice
fasting
19
So
Jesus
said
to
them
While
the
bridegroom
is
with
them
the
friends
of
the
bridegroom
have
no
reason
to
fast
do
they
As
long
as
they
have
the
bridegroom
with
them
they
cannot
fast
20
But
days
will
come
when
the
bridegroom
will
be
taken
away
from
them
and
then
they
will
fast
on
that
day
21
Nobody
sews
a
patch
of
unshrunk
cloth
on
an
old
outer
garment
If
he
does
the
new
piece
pulls
away
from
the
old
and
the
tear
becomes
worse
22
Also
no
one
puts
new
wine
into
old
wineskins
If
he
does
the
wine
will
burst
the
skins
and
the
wine
is
lost
as
well
as
the
skins
But
new
wine
is
put
into
new
wineskins
23
Now
as
he
was
passing
through
the
grainfields
on
the
Sabbath
his
disciples
started
to
pluck
the
heads
of
grain
as
they
went
24
So
the
Pharisees
said
to
him
Look
here
Why
are
they
doing
what
is
not
lawful
on
the
Sabbath
25
But
he
said
to
them
Have
you
never
read
what
David
did
when
he
was
in
need
and
he
and
the
men
with
him
were
hungry
26
How
in
the
account
about
Abiathar
the
chief
priest
he
entered
into
the
house
of
God
and
ate
the
loaves
of
presentation
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
anybody
to
eat
except
the
priests
and
he
also
gave
some
to
the
men
who
were
with
him
27
Then
he
said
to
them
The
Sabbath
came
into
existence
for
the
sake
of
man
and
not
man
for
the
sake
of
the
Sabbath
28
So
the
Son
of
man
is
Lord
even
of
the
Sabbath
1
Once
again
he
entered
into
a
synagogue
and
a
man
with
a
withered
hand
was
there
2
So
they
were
watching
him
closely
to
see
whether
he
would
cure
the
man
on
the
Sabbath
in
order
to
accuse
him
3
He
said
to
the
man
with
the
withered
hand
Get
up
and
come
to
the
center
4
Next
he
said
to
them
Is
it
lawful
on
the
Sabbath
to
do
good
or
to
do
harm
to
save
a
life
or
to
kill
But
they
kept
silent
5
After
looking
around
at
them
with
indignation
being
thoroughly
grieved
at
the
insensibility
of
their
hearts
he
said
to
the
man
Stretch
out
your
hand
And
he
stretched
it
out
and
his
hand
was
restored
6
At
that
the
Pharisees
went
out
and
immediately
began
holding
council
with
the
party
followers
of
Herod
against
him
in
order
to
kill
him
7
But
Jesus
departed
for
the
sea
along
with
his
disciples
and
a
great
multitude
from
Galilee
and
from
Judea
followed
him
8
Even
from
Jerusalem
and
from
Idumea
and
from
across
the
Jordan
and
from
around
Tyre
and
Sidon
a
great
multitude
came
to
him
when
they
heard
about
the
many
things
he
was
doing
9
And
he
told
his
disciples
to
have
a
small
boat
ready
for
him
so
that
the
crowd
would
not
press
in
on
him
10
Because
he
cured
many
all
those
who
had
serious
diseases
were
crowding
around
him
to
touch
him
11
Even
the
unclean
spirits
whenever
they
saw
him
would
fall
down
before
him
and
cry
out
and
say
You
are
the
Son
of
God
12
But
many
times
he
sternly
ordered
them
not
to
make
him
known
13
He
ascended
a
mountain
and
summoned
those
whom
he
wanted
and
they
came
to
him
14
And
he
formed
a
group
of
12
whom
he
also
named
apostles
those
who
were
to
accompany
him
and
whom
he
would
send
out
to
preach
15
and
to
have
authority
to
expel
demons
16
And
the
group
of
12
that
he
formed
were
Simon
to
whom
he
also
gave
the
name
Peter
17
James
the
son
of
Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
of
James
he
also
gave
these
the
name
Boanerges
which
means
Sons
of
Thunder
18
Andrew
Philip
Bartholomew
Matthew
Thomas
James
the
son
of
Alphaeus
Thaddaeus
Simon
the
Cananaean
19
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
later
betrayed
him
Then
he
went
into
a
house
20
and
again
the
crowd
gathered
so
that
they
were
not
able
even
to
eat
a
meal
21
But
when
his
relatives
heard
about
it
they
went
out
to
seize
him
for
they
were
saying
He
has
gone
out
of
his
mind
22
Also
the
scribes
who
came
down
from
Jerusalem
were
saying
He
has
Beelzebub
and
he
expels
the
demons
by
means
of
the
ruler
of
the
demons
23
So
after
calling
them
to
him
he
spoke
to
them
with
illustrations
How
can
Satan
expel
Satan
24
If
a
kingdom
becomes
divided
against
itself
that
kingdom
cannot
stand
25
and
if
a
house
becomes
divided
against
itself
that
house
will
not
be
able
to
stand
26
Also
if
Satan
has
risen
up
against
himself
and
has
become
divided
he
cannot
stand
but
is
coming
to
an
end
27
In
fact
no
one
who
enters
the
house
of
a
strong
man
is
able
to
steal
his
possessions
unless
he
first
ties
up
the
strong
man
Only
then
can
he
plunder
his
house
28
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
all
things
will
be
forgiven
the
sons
of
men
no
matter
what
sins
they
commit
and
what
blasphemies
they
speak
29
But
whoever
blasphemes
against
the
holy
spirit
has
no
forgiveness
forever
but
is
guilty
of
everlasting
sin
30
He
said
this
because
they
were
saying
He
has
an
unclean
spirit
31
Now
his
mother
and
his
brothers
came
and
standing
outside
they
sent
someone
in
to
call
him
32
As
there
was
a
crowd
sitting
around
him
they
said
to
him
Look
Your
mother
and
your
brothers
are
outside
asking
for
you
33
But
he
replied
to
them
Who
are
my
mother
and
my
brothers
34
Then
he
looked
at
those
sitting
around
him
in
a
circle
and
said
See
my
mother
and
my
brothers
35
Whoever
does
the
will
of
God
this
one
is
my
brother
and
sister
and
mother
1
Again
he
began
teaching
beside
the
sea
and
a
very
large
crowd
gathered
near
him
So
he
went
aboard
a
boat
and
sat
in
it
away
from
the
shore
but
the
whole
crowd
was
next
to
the
sea
along
the
shore
2
And
he
began
to
teach
them
many
things
with
illustrations
and
while
he
was
teaching
he
said
to
them
3
Listen
Look
The
sower
went
out
to
sow
4
As
he
was
sowing
some
seeds
fell
alongside
the
road
and
the
birds
came
and
ate
them
up
5
Others
fell
on
rocky
ground
where
there
was
not
much
soil
and
they
immediately
sprang
up
because
the
soil
was
not
deep
6
But
when
the
sun
rose
they
were
scorched
and
they
withered
because
they
had
no
root
7
Other
seeds
fell
among
the
thorns
and
the
thorns
came
up
and
choked
them
and
they
yielded
no
fruit
8
But
others
fell
on
the
fine
soil
and
growing
up
and
increasing
they
began
to
yield
fruit
and
they
were
bearing
30
60
and
100
times
more
9
Then
he
added
Let
the
one
who
has
ears
to
listen
listen
10
Now
when
he
was
alone
those
around
him
with
the
Twelve
began
questioning
him
about
the
illustrations
11
He
said
to
them
To
you
the
sacred
secret
of
the
Kingdom
of
God
has
been
given
but
to
those
outside
all
things
are
in
illustrations
12
so
that
though
looking
they
may
look
and
still
not
see
and
though
hearing
they
may
hear
and
still
not
get
the
sense
of
it
nor
will
they
ever
turn
back
and
receive
forgiveness
13
Further
he
said
to
them
You
do
not
know
this
illustration
so
how
will
you
understand
all
the
other
illustrations
14
The
sower
sows
the
word
15
These
then
are
the
ones
alongside
the
road
where
the
word
is
sown
but
as
soon
as
they
have
heard
it
Satan
comes
and
takes
away
the
word
that
was
sown
in
them
16
Likewise
these
are
the
ones
sown
on
rocky
ground
as
soon
as
they
have
heard
the
word
they
accept
it
with
joy
17
Yet
they
have
no
root
in
themselves
but
they
continue
for
a
time
then
as
soon
as
tribulation
or
persecution
arises
because
of
the
word
they
are
stumbled
18
There
are
still
others
that
are
sown
among
the
thorns
These
are
the
ones
who
have
heard
the
word
19
but
the
anxieties
of
this
system
of
things
and
the
deceptive
power
of
riches
and
the
desires
for
everything
else
make
inroads
and
choke
the
word
and
it
becomes
unfruitful
20
Finally
the
ones
that
were
sown
on
the
fine
soil
are
those
who
listen
to
the
word
and
favorably
receive
it
and
bear
fruit—30
60
and
100
times
more
21
He
also
said
to
them
A
lamp
is
not
brought
out
to
be
put
under
a
basket
or
under
a
bed
is
it
Is
it
not
brought
out
to
be
put
on
a
lampstand
22
For
there
is
nothing
hidden
that
will
not
be
exposed
nothing
is
carefully
concealed
that
will
not
come
out
in
the
open
23
Whoever
has
ears
to
listen
let
him
listen
24
He
further
said
to
them
Pay
attention
to
what
you
are
hearing
With
the
measure
that
you
are
measuring
out
you
will
have
it
measured
out
to
you
yes
you
will
have
more
added
to
you
25
For
whoever
has
will
have
more
given
to
him
but
whoever
does
not
have
even
what
he
has
will
be
taken
away
from
him
26
So
he
went
on
to
say
In
this
way
the
Kingdom
of
God
is
just
as
when
a
man
casts
seeds
on
the
ground
27
He
sleeps
at
night
and
rises
up
by
day
and
the
seeds
sprout
and
grow
tall—just
how
he
does
not
know
28
On
its
own
the
ground
bears
fruit
gradually
first
the
stalk
then
the
head
finally
the
full
grain
in
the
head
29
But
as
soon
as
the
crop
permits
it
he
thrusts
in
the
sickle
because
the
harvesttime
has
come
30
And
he
went
on
to
say
With
what
can
we
compare
the
Kingdom
of
God
or
with
what
illustration
can
we
explain
it
31
It
is
like
a
mustard
grain
which
at
the
time
it
was
sown
in
the
ground
was
the
tiniest
of
all
the
seeds
on
the
earth
32
But
when
it
has
been
sown
it
grows
and
becomes
greater
than
all
other
vegetable
plants
and
produces
great
branches
so
that
the
birds
of
heaven
are
able
to
find
lodging
under
its
shadow
33
With
many
illustrations
of
that
sort
he
spoke
the
word
to
them
to
the
extent
that
they
were
able
to
listen
34
Indeed
without
an
illustration
he
would
not
speak
to
them
but
he
would
explain
all
things
privately
to
his
disciples
35
And
on
that
day
when
evening
had
fallen
he
said
to
them
Let
us
cross
to
the
other
shore
36
So
after
they
had
dismissed
the
crowd
they
took
him
in
the
boat
just
as
he
was
and
there
were
other
boats
with
him
37
Now
a
great
violent
windstorm
broke
out
and
the
waves
kept
crashing
into
the
boat
so
that
the
boat
was
close
to
being
swamped
38
But
he
was
in
the
stern
sleeping
on
the
pillow
So
they
woke
him
up
and
said
to
him
Teacher
do
you
not
care
that
we
are
about
to
perish
39
With
that
he
got
up
and
rebuked
the
wind
and
said
to
the
sea
Hush
Be
quiet
And
the
wind
abated
and
a
great
calm
set
in
40
So
he
said
to
them
Why
are
you
so
afraid
Do
you
not
yet
have
any
faith
41
But
they
felt
an
unusual
fear
and
they
said
to
one
another
Who
really
is
this
Even
the
wind
and
the
sea
obey
him
1
Then
they
came
to
the
other
side
of
the
sea
into
the
region
of
the
Gerasenes
2
And
immediately
after
Jesus
got
out
of
the
boat
a
man
under
the
power
of
an
unclean
spirit
met
him
from
among
the
tombs
3
His
haunt
was
among
the
tombs
and
up
to
that
time
absolutely
no
one
was
able
to
bind
him
securely
even
with
a
chain
4
He
had
often
been
bound
with
fetters
and
chains
but
he
snapped
the
chains
apart
and
smashed
the
fetters
and
nobody
had
the
strength
to
subdue
him
5
And
continually
night
and
day
he
was
crying
out
in
the
tombs
and
in
the
mountains
and
slashing
himself
with
stones
6
But
on
catching
sight
of
Jesus
from
a
distance
he
ran
and
bowed
down
to
him
7
Then
he
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
What
have
I
to
do
with
you
Jesus
Son
of
the
Most
High
God
I
put
you
under
oath
by
God
not
to
torment
me
8
For
Jesus
had
been
saying
to
it
Come
out
of
the
man
you
unclean
spirit
9
But
Jesus
asked
him
What
is
your
name
And
he
replied
My
name
is
Legion
because
there
are
many
of
us
10
And
he
kept
pleading
with
Jesus
not
to
send
the
spirits
out
of
the
country
11
Now
a
great
herd
of
swine
was
feeding
there
at
the
mountain
12
So
the
spirits
pleaded
with
him
Send
us
into
the
swine
so
that
we
may
enter
into
them
13
And
he
gave
them
permission
With
that
the
unclean
spirits
came
out
and
went
into
the
swine
and
the
herd
rushed
over
the
precipice
into
the
sea
about
2000
of
them
and
were
drowned
in
the
sea
14
But
their
herders
fled
and
reported
it
in
the
city
and
in
the
countryside
and
people
came
to
see
what
had
happened
15
So
they
came
to
Jesus
and
saw
the
demon-possessed
man
the
one
who
previously
had
the
Legion
sitting
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
and
they
grew
fearful
16
Also
those
who
had
seen
it
related
to
them
how
this
had
happened
to
the
demon-possessed
man
and
the
swine
17
So
they
began
to
plead
with
Jesus
to
go
away
from
their
region
18
Now
as
he
was
boarding
the
boat
the
man
who
had
been
demon-possessed
pleaded
to
go
with
him
19
However
he
did
not
let
him
but
said
to
him
Go
home
to
your
relatives
and
report
to
them
all
the
things
Jehovah
has
done
for
you
and
the
mercy
he
has
shown
you
20
This
man
went
away
and
started
to
proclaim
in
the
Decapolis
all
the
things
Jesus
had
done
for
him
and
all
the
people
were
amazed
21
After
Jesus
had
crossed
again
by
boat
to
the
opposite
shore
a
large
crowd
gathered
together
to
him
and
he
was
by
the
sea
22
One
of
the
presiding
officers
of
the
synagogue
named
Jairus
now
came
and
on
catching
sight
of
him
he
fell
at
his
feet
23
He
pleaded
with
him
many
times
saying
My
little
daughter
is
extremely
ill
Please
come
and
put
your
hands
on
her
so
that
she
may
get
well
and
live
24
At
that
Jesus
went
with
him
and
a
large
crowd
was
following
him
and
pressing
against
him
25
Now
there
was
a
woman
who
had
had
a
flow
of
blood
for
12
years
26
She
had
suffered
much
at
the
hands
of
many
physicians
and
had
spent
all
her
resources
and
she
was
no
better
but
rather
had
become
worse
27
When
she
heard
the
reports
about
Jesus
she
came
up
behind
him
in
the
crowd
and
touched
his
outer
garment
28
for
she
kept
saying
If
I
touch
just
his
outer
garments
I
will
get
well
29
And
immediately
her
flow
of
blood
dried
up
and
she
sensed
in
her
body
that
she
had
been
healed
of
the
grievous
sickness
30
Immediately
Jesus
realized
in
himself
that
power
had
gone
out
of
him
and
he
turned
around
in
the
crowd
and
asked
Who
touched
my
outer
garments
31
But
his
disciples
said
to
him
You
see
the
crowd
pressing
in
on
you
and
you
ask
Who
touched
me
32
However
he
was
looking
around
to
see
who
had
done
this
33
The
woman
frightened
and
trembling
knowing
what
had
happened
to
her
came
and
fell
down
before
him
and
told
him
the
whole
truth
34
He
said
to
her
Daughter
your
faith
has
made
you
well
Go
in
peace
and
be
healed
from
your
grievous
sickness
35
While
he
was
yet
speaking
some
men
from
the
home
of
the
presiding
officer
of
the
synagogue
came
and
said
Your
daughter
died
Why
bother
the
Teacher
any
longer
36
But
Jesus
overheard
their
words
and
said
to
the
presiding
officer
of
the
synagogue
Have
no
fear
only
exercise
faith
37
Now
he
did
not
let
anyone
follow
him
except
Peter
James
and
John
the
brother
of
James
38
So
they
came
to
the
house
of
the
presiding
officer
of
the
synagogue
and
he
saw
the
commotion
and
those
weeping
and
wailing
loudly
39
After
stepping
in
he
said
to
them
Why
are
you
weeping
and
causing
this
commotion
The
child
has
not
died
but
is
sleeping
40
At
this
they
began
to
laugh
at
him
scornfully
But
after
sending
them
all
outside
he
took
the
childs
father
and
mother
and
those
with
him
and
he
went
in
where
the
child
was
41
Then
taking
the
hand
of
the
child
he
said
to
her
Talitha
cumi

which
when
translated
means
Little
girl
I
say
to
you
get
up
42
And
immediately
the
girl
rose
and
began
walking
She
was
12
years
old
And
at
once
they
were
beside
themselves
with
great
ecstasy
43
But
he
ordered
them
again
and
again
to
let
no
one
learn
of
this
and
he
said
that
something
should
be
given
her
to
eat
1
He
departed
from
there
and
came
into
his
home
territory
and
his
disciples
followed
him
2
When
it
was
the
Sabbath
he
started
teaching
in
the
synagogue
and
most
who
heard
him
were
astounded
and
said
Where
did
this
man
get
these
things
And
why
should
this
wisdom
have
been
given
to
him
and
such
powerful
works
be
performed
through
his
hands
3
This
is
the
carpenter
the
son
of
Mary
and
the
brother
of
James
Joseph
Judas
and
Simon
is
it
not
And
his
sisters
are
here
with
us
are
they
not
So
they
began
to
stumble
because
of
him
4
But
Jesus
said
to
them
A
prophet
is
not
without
honor
except
in
his
home
territory
and
among
his
relatives
and
in
his
own
house
5
So
he
was
not
able
to
do
any
powerful
work
there
except
to
lay
his
hands
on
a
few
sick
people
and
cure
them
6
Indeed
he
was
amazed
at
their
lack
of
faith
And
he
went
around
in
a
circuit
to
the
villages
teaching
7
He
now
summoned
the
Twelve
and
started
sending
them
out
two
by
two
and
he
gave
them
authority
over
the
unclean
spirits
8
Also
he
gave
them
orders
to
carry
nothing
for
the
trip
except
a
staff—no
bread
no
food
pouch
no
money
in
their
belts—
9
but
to
put
on
sandals
and
not
to
wear
two
garments
10
Further
he
said
to
them
Wherever
you
enter
into
a
home
stay
there
until
you
leave
that
place
11
And
wherever
a
place
will
not
receive
you
or
listen
to
you
on
going
out
from
there
shake
off
the
dirt
that
is
on
your
feet
for
a
witness
to
them
12
Then
they
set
out
and
preached
that
people
should
repent
13
and
they
expelled
many
demons
and
greased
many
sick
people
with
oil
and
cured
them
14
Now
King
Herod
heard
of
this
for
the
name
of
Jesus
became
well-known
and
people
were
saying
John
the
Baptizer
has
been
raised
up
from
the
dead
and
that
is
why
the
powerful
works
are
operating
in
him
15
But
others
were
saying
It
is
Elijah
Still
others
were
saying
It
is
a
prophet
like
one
of
the
prophets
of
old
16
But
when
Herod
heard
it
he
said
The
John
whom
I
beheaded
this
one
has
been
raised
up
17
For
Herod
himself
had
sent
out
and
arrested
John
and
had
bound
him
in
prison
on
account
of
Herodias
the
wife
of
Philip
his
brother
because
he
had
married
her
18
For
John
had
been
saying
to
Herod
It
is
not
lawful
for
you
to
have
your
brothers
wife
19
So
Herodias
was
nursing
a
grudge
against
him
and
wanted
to
kill
him
but
she
could
not
20
For
Herod
was
in
fear
of
John
knowing
him
to
be
a
righteous
and
holy
man
and
he
was
keeping
him
safe
After
hearing
him
he
was
at
a
great
loss
as
to
what
to
do
yet
he
continued
to
hear
him
gladly
21
But
a
convenient
day
arrived
when
Herod
spread
an
evening
meal
on
his
birthday
for
his
high
officials
and
the
military
commanders
and
the
most
prominent
men
of
Galilee
22
And
the
daughter
of
Herodias
came
in
and
danced
and
pleased
Herod
and
those
dining
with
him
The
king
said
to
the
girl
Ask
me
for
whatever
you
want
and
I
will
give
it
to
you
23
Yes
he
swore
to
her
Whatever
you
ask
me
for
I
will
give
it
to
you
up
to
half
my
kingdom
24
So
she
went
out
and
said
to
her
mother
What
should
I
ask
for
She
said
The
head
of
John
the
Baptizer
25
She
immediately
rushed
in
to
the
king
and
made
her
request
saying
I
want
you
to
give
me
right
away
on
a
platter
the
head
of
John
the
Baptist
26
Although
this
deeply
grieved
him
the
king
did
not
want
to
disregard
her
request
because
of
his
oaths
and
his
guests
27
So
the
king
immediately
sent
a
bodyguard
and
commanded
him
to
bring
Johns
head
So
he
went
off
and
beheaded
him
in
the
prison
28
and
brought
his
head
on
a
platter
He
gave
it
to
the
girl
and
the
girl
gave
it
to
her
mother
29
When
his
disciples
heard
of
it
they
came
and
took
his
body
and
laid
it
in
a
tomb
30
The
apostles
gathered
around
Jesus
and
reported
to
him
all
the
things
they
had
done
and
taught
31
And
he
said
to
them
Come
you
yourselves
privately
into
an
isolated
place
and
rest
up
a
little
For
there
were
many
coming
and
going
and
they
had
no
leisure
time
even
to
eat
a
meal
32
So
they
set
off
in
the
boat
for
an
isolated
place
to
be
by
themselves
33
But
people
saw
them
going
and
many
got
to
know
it
and
from
all
the
cities
they
ran
together
on
foot
and
got
there
ahead
of
them
34
Well
on
getting
out
he
saw
a
large
crowd
and
he
was
moved
with
pity
for
them
because
they
were
as
sheep
without
a
shepherd
And
he
started
to
teach
them
many
things
35
By
now
the
hour
had
grown
late
and
his
disciples
came
up
to
him
and
said
This
place
is
isolated
and
the
hour
is
already
late
36
Send
them
away
so
that
they
may
go
off
into
the
surrounding
countryside
and
villages
and
buy
themselves
something
to
eat
37
He
replied
to
them
You
give
them
something
to
eat
At
this
they
said
to
him
Should
we
go
off
and
buy
200
denarii
worth
of
bread
and
give
it
to
the
people
to
eat
38
He
said
to
them
How
many
loaves
do
you
have
Go
see
After
finding
out
they
said
Five
besides
two
fish
39
And
he
instructed
all
the
people
to
recline
in
groups
on
the
green
grass
40
So
they
reclined
in
groups
of
100
and
of
50
41
Taking
now
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish
he
looked
up
to
heaven
and
said
a
blessing
Then
he
broke
the
loaves
up
and
began
giving
them
to
the
disciples
to
place
them
before
the
people
and
he
divided
up
the
two
fish
for
all
42
So
they
all
ate
and
were
satisfied
43
and
they
took
up
12
baskets
full
of
fragments
aside
from
the
fish
44
Those
who
ate
the
loaves
were
5000
men
45
Then
without
delay
he
made
his
disciples
board
the
boat
and
go
on
ahead
to
the
opposite
shore
toward
Bethsaida
while
he
himself
sent
the
crowd
away
46
But
after
saying
good-bye
to
them
he
went
to
a
mountain
to
pray
47
When
evening
had
fallen
the
boat
was
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
but
he
was
alone
on
the
land
48
So
when
he
saw
them
struggling
to
row
for
the
wind
was
against
them
about
the
fourth
watch
of
the
night
he
came
toward
them
walking
on
the
sea
but
he
was
inclined
to
pass
them
by
49
On
catching
sight
of
him
walking
on
the
sea
they
thought
It
is
an
apparition
And
they
cried
out
50
For
they
all
saw
him
and
were
troubled
But
immediately
he
spoke
to
them
and
said
Take
courage
It
is
I
do
not
be
afraid
51
Then
he
got
up
into
the
boat
with
them
and
the
wind
abated
At
this
they
were
utterly
amazed
52
for
they
had
not
grasped
the
meaning
of
the
loaves
but
their
hearts
continued
dull
in
understanding
53
When
they
got
across
to
land
they
came
to
Gennesaret
and
anchored
the
boat
nearby
54
But
as
soon
as
they
got
out
of
the
boat
people
recognized
him
55
They
ran
around
all
that
region
and
started
to
bring
on
stretchers
those
who
were
ailing
to
where
they
heard
he
was
56
And
wherever
he
would
enter
into
villages
or
cities
or
the
countryside
they
would
place
the
sick
ones
in
the
marketplaces
and
they
would
plead
with
him
that
they
might
touch
just
the
fringe
of
his
outer
garment
And
all
those
who
touched
it
were
made
well
1
Now
the
Pharisees
and
some
of
the
scribes
who
had
come
from
Jerusalem
gathered
around
him
2
And
they
saw
some
of
his
disciples
eat
their
meal
with
defiled
hands
that
is
unwashed
ones
3
For
the
Pharisees
and
all
the
Jews
do
not
eat
unless
they
wash
their
hands
up
to
the
elbow
clinging
to
the
tradition
of
the
men
of
former
times
4
and
when
they
come
from
the
market
they
do
not
eat
unless
they
wash
themselves
There
are
many
other
traditions
that
they
have
received
and
cling
to
such
as
baptisms
of
cups
pitchers
and
copper
vessels
5
So
these
Pharisees
and
scribes
asked
him
Why
do
your
disciples
not
observe
the
tradition
of
the
men
of
former
times
but
they
eat
their
meal
with
defiled
hands
6
He
said
to
them
Isaiah
aptly
prophesied
about
you
hypocrites
as
it
is
written
This
people
honor
me
with
their
lips
but
their
hearts
are
far
removed
from
me
7
It
is
in
vain
that
they
keep
worshipping
me
for
they
teach
commands
of
men
as
doctrines
8
You
let
go
of
the
commandment
of
God
and
cling
to
the
tradition
of
men
9
Further
he
said
to
them
You
skillfully
disregard
the
commandment
of
God
in
order
to
keep
your
tradition
10
For
example
Moses
said
Honor
your
father
and
your
mother

and
Let
the
one
who
speaks
abusively
of
his
father
or
mother
be
put
to
death
11
But
you
say
If
a
man
says
to
his
father
or
his
mother
Whatever
I
have
that
could
benefit
you
is
corban
that
is
a
gift
dedicated
to
God

12
you
no
longer
let
him
do
a
single
thing
for
his
father
or
his
mother
13
Thus
you
make
the
word
of
God
invalid
by
your
tradition
that
you
have
handed
down
And
you
do
many
things
like
this
14
So
calling
the
crowd
to
him
again
he
said
to
them
Listen
to
me
all
of
you
and
understand
the
meaning
15
Nothing
from
outside
a
man
that
enters
into
him
can
defile
him
but
the
things
that
come
out
of
a
man
are
the
things
that
defile
him
16
——
17
Now
when
he
had
entered
a
house
away
from
the
crowd
his
disciples
began
to
question
him
about
the
illustration
18
So
he
said
to
them
Are
you
also
without
understanding
like
them
Are
you
not
aware
that
nothing
from
outside
that
enters
into
a
man
can
defile
him
19
since
it
enters
not
into
his
heart
but
into
his
stomach
and
it
passes
out
into
the
sewer
Thus
he
declared
all
foods
clean
20
Further
he
said
That
which
comes
out
of
a
man
is
what
defiles
him
21
For
from
inside
out
of
the
heart
of
men
come
injurious
reasonings
sexual
immorality
thefts
murders
22
acts
of
adultery
greed
acts
of
wickedness
deceit
brazen
conduct
an
envious
eye
blasphemy
haughtiness
and
unreasonableness
23
All
these
wicked
things
come
from
within
and
defile
a
man
24
He
rose
up
from
there
and
went
into
the
region
of
Tyre
and
Sidon
There
he
entered
into
a
house
and
did
not
want
anyone
to
know
it
but
he
could
not
escape
notice
25
Immediately
a
woman
whose
little
daughter
had
an
unclean
spirit
heard
about
him
and
came
and
fell
down
at
his
feet
26
The
woman
was
a
Greek
a
Syrophoenician
by
nationality
and
she
kept
asking
him
to
expel
the
demon
from
her
daughter
27
But
he
said
to
her
First
let
the
children
be
satisfied
for
it
is
not
right
to
take
the
bread
of
the
children
and
throw
it
to
the
little
dogs
28
But
she
replied
to
him
Yes
sir
and
yet
even
the
little
dogs
underneath
the
table
eat
of
the
crumbs
of
the
little
children
29
At
that
he
said
to
her
Because
you
said
this
go
the
demon
has
gone
out
of
your
daughter
30
So
she
went
away
to
her
home
and
found
the
young
child
lying
on
the
bed
and
the
demon
was
gone
31
When
Jesus
returned
from
the
region
of
Tyre
he
went
through
Sidon
to
the
Sea
of
Galilee
through
the
region
of
Decapolis
32
Here
they
brought
him
a
deaf
man
with
a
speech
impediment
and
they
pleaded
with
him
to
lay
his
hand
on
him
33
And
he
took
him
aside
privately
away
from
the
crowd
Then
he
put
his
fingers
into
the
mans
ears
and
after
spitting
he
touched
his
tongue
34
And
looking
up
into
heaven
he
sighed
deeply
and
said
to
him
Ephphatha

that
is
Be
opened
35
At
this
his
ears
were
opened
and
his
speech
impediment
was
removed
and
he
began
speaking
normally
36
With
that
he
ordered
them
not
to
tell
anyone
but
the
more
he
would
order
them
the
more
they
would
proclaim
it
37
Indeed
they
were
astounded
beyond
measure
and
they
said
He
has
done
all
things
well
He
even
makes
the
deaf
hear
and
the
speechless
speak
1
In
those
days
there
was
again
a
large
crowd
and
they
had
nothing
to
eat
So
he
summoned
the
disciples
and
said
to
them
2
I
feel
pity
for
the
crowd
because
they
have
already
stayed
with
me
for
three
days
and
they
have
nothing
to
eat
3
If
I
send
them
off
to
their
homes
hungry
they
will
give
out
on
the
road
and
some
of
them
are
from
far
away
4
But
his
disciples
answered
him
From
where
will
anyone
get
enough
bread
in
this
isolated
place
to
satisfy
these
people
5
At
this
he
asked
them
How
many
loaves
do
you
have
They
said
Seven
6
And
he
instructed
the
crowd
to
recline
on
the
ground
Then
he
took
the
seven
loaves
gave
thanks
broke
them
and
began
giving
them
to
his
disciples
to
serve
and
they
served
them
to
the
crowd
7
They
also
had
a
few
small
fish
and
blessing
these
he
told
them
to
serve
these
also
8
So
they
ate
and
were
satisfied
and
they
took
up
seven
large
baskets
full
of
leftover
fragments
9
Now
there
were
about
4000
men
Then
he
sent
them
away
10
Immediately
he
boarded
the
boat
with
his
disciples
and
came
into
the
region
of
Dalmanutha
11
Here
the
Pharisees
came
and
started
disputing
with
him
demanding
from
him
a
sign
from
heaven
to
put
him
to
the
test
12
So
he
sighed
deeply
in
his
spirit
and
said
Why
does
this
generation
seek
a
sign
Truly
I
say
no
sign
will
be
given
to
this
generation
13
With
that
he
left
them
got
aboard
again
and
went
to
the
opposite
shore
14
However
they
forgot
to
take
bread
along
and
they
had
nothing
with
them
in
the
boat
except
for
one
loaf
15
And
he
warned
them
in
no
uncertain
terms
Keep
your
eyes
open
look
out
for
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees
and
the
leaven
of
Herod
16
So
they
began
arguing
with
one
another
over
the
fact
that
they
had
no
bread
17
Noting
this
he
said
to
them
Why
do
you
argue
over
your
having
no
bread
Do
you
not
yet
perceive
and
understand
Are
your
hearts
still
dull
in
understanding
18
Though
having
eyes
do
you
not
see
and
though
having
ears
do
you
not
hear
Do
you
not
remember
19
when
I
broke
the
five
loaves
for
the
5000
men
how
many
baskets
full
of
fragments
you
collected
They
said
to
him
Twelve
20
When
I
broke
the
seven
loaves
for
the
4000
men
how
many
large
baskets
full
of
fragments
did
you
take
up
And
they
said
to
him
Seven
21
With
that
he
said
to
them
Do
you
not
yet
understand
22
Now
they
put
in
at
Bethsaida
Here
people
brought
him
a
blind
man
and
they
pleaded
with
him
to
touch
him
23
And
he
took
the
blind
man
by
the
hand
and
brought
him
outside
the
village
After
spitting
on
his
eyes
he
laid
his
hands
on
him
and
asked
him
Do
you
see
anything
24
The
man
looked
up
and
said
I
see
people
but
they
look
like
trees
walking
about
25
Again
he
laid
his
hands
on
the
mans
eyes
and
the
man
saw
clearly
His
sight
was
restored
and
he
could
see
everything
distinctly
26
So
he
sent
him
home
saying
Do
not
enter
into
the
village
27
Jesus
and
his
disciples
now
left
for
the
villages
of
Caesarea
Philippi
and
on
the
way
he
began
to
question
his
disciples
saying
Who
are
people
saying
that
I
am
28
They
said
to
him
John
the
Baptist
but
others
say
Elijah
and
still
others
one
of
the
prophets
29
And
he
put
the
question
to
them
You
though
who
do
you
say
I
am
Peter
answered
him
You
are
the
Christ
30
At
that
he
strictly
ordered
them
not
to
tell
anyone
about
him
31
Also
he
began
teaching
them
that
the
Son
of
man
must
undergo
many
sufferings
and
be
rejected
by
the
elders
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
be
killed
and
rise
three
days
later
32
Indeed
he
was
making
that
statement
openly
But
Peter
took
him
aside
and
began
to
rebuke
him
33
At
this
he
turned
looked
at
his
disciples
and
rebuked
Peter
saying
Get
behind
me
Satan
because
you
think
not
Gods
thoughts
but
those
of
men
34
He
now
called
the
crowd
to
him
with
his
disciples
and
said
to
them
If
anyone
wants
to
come
after
me
let
him
disown
himself
and
pick
up
his
torture
stake
and
keep
following
me
35
For
whoever
wants
to
save
his
life
will
lose
it
but
whoever
loses
his
life
for
my
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
the
good
news
will
save
it
36
Really
what
good
will
it
do
a
man
to
gain
the
whole
world
and
to
lose
his
life
37
What
really
would
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
life
38
For
whoever
becomes
ashamed
of
me
and
my
words
in
this
adulterous
and
sinful
generation
the
Son
of
man
will
also
be
ashamed
of
him
when
he
comes
in
the
glory
of
his
Father
with
the
holy
angels
1
Furthermore
he
said
to
them
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
there
are
some
of
those
standing
here
who
will
not
taste
death
at
all
until
first
they
see
the
Kingdom
of
God
already
having
come
in
power
2
Six
days
later
Jesus
took
Peter
and
James
and
John
along
and
led
them
up
into
a
lofty
mountain
by
themselves
And
he
was
transfigured
before
them
3
his
outer
garments
began
to
glisten
becoming
far
whiter
than
any
clothes
cleaner
on
earth
could
whiten
them
4
Also
Elijah
with
Moses
appeared
to
them
and
they
were
conversing
with
Jesus
5
Then
Peter
said
to
Jesus
Rabbi
it
is
fine
for
us
to
be
here
So
let
us
erect
three
tents
one
for
you
one
for
Moses
and
one
for
Elijah
6
In
fact
he
did
not
know
how
to
react
for
they
were
quite
fearful
7
And
a
cloud
formed
overshadowing
them
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
cloud
This
is
my
Son
the
beloved
Listen
to
him
8
Then
suddenly
they
looked
around
and
saw
that
no
one
was
with
them
any
longer
except
Jesus
9
As
they
were
coming
down
from
the
mountain
he
strictly
ordered
them
not
to
relate
to
anybody
what
they
had
seen
until
after
the
Son
of
man
had
risen
from
the
dead
10
They
took
the
word
to
heart
but
discussed
among
themselves
what
this
rising
from
the
dead
meant
11
And
they
began
to
question
him
saying
Why
do
the
scribes
say
that
Elijah
must
come
first
12
He
said
to
them
Elijah
does
come
first
and
restore
all
things
but
how
is
it
that
it
is
written
about
the
Son
of
man
that
he
must
undergo
many
sufferings
and
be
treated
with
contempt
13
But
I
say
to
you
that
Elijah
in
fact
has
come
and
they
did
to
him
whatever
they
wanted
just
as
it
is
written
about
him
14
When
they
came
to
the
other
disciples
they
noticed
a
large
crowd
around
them
and
there
were
scribes
arguing
with
them
15
But
as
soon
as
all
the
crowd
caught
sight
of
him
they
were
astonished
and
they
ran
up
to
him
to
greet
him
16
So
he
asked
them
What
are
you
arguing
about
with
them
17
And
one
of
the
crowd
answered
him
Teacher
I
brought
my
son
to
you
because
he
has
a
speechless
spirit
18
Wherever
it
seizes
him
it
throws
him
to
the
ground
and
he
foams
at
the
mouth
and
grinds
his
teeth
and
loses
his
strength
I
asked
your
disciples
to
expel
it
but
they
were
not
able
to
do
so
19
In
response
he
said
to
them
O
faithless
generation
how
long
must
I
continue
with
you
How
long
must
I
put
up
with
you
Bring
him
to
me
20
So
they
brought
the
boy
to
him
but
at
the
sight
of
him
the
spirit
at
once
threw
the
child
into
convulsions
After
falling
on
the
ground
he
kept
rolling
about
foaming
at
the
mouth
21
Then
Jesus
asked
the
father
How
long
has
this
been
happening
to
him
He
said
From
childhood
on
22
and
often
it
would
throw
him
into
the
fire
and
also
into
the
water
to
destroy
him
But
if
you
can
do
anything
have
pity
on
us
and
help
us
23
Jesus
said
to
him
That
expression
If
you
can
Why
all
things
are
possible
for
the
one
who
has
faith
24
Immediately
the
childs
father
cried
out
and
said
I
have
faith
Help
me
out
where
I
need
faith
25
Jesus
now
noticing
that
a
crowd
was
rushing
toward
them
rebuked
the
unclean
spirit
saying
to
it
You
speechless
and
deaf
spirit
I
order
you
get
out
of
him
and
do
not
enter
into
him
again
26
After
crying
out
and
going
through
many
convulsions
it
came
out
and
the
child
seemed
to
be
dead
so
that
most
of
the
people
were
saying
He
is
dead
27
But
Jesus
took
him
by
the
hand
and
raised
him
up
and
he
stood
up
28
So
after
he
entered
into
a
house
his
disciples
asked
him
privately
Why
could
we
not
expel
it
29
He
said
to
them
This
kind
can
come
out
only
by
prayer
30
They
departed
from
there
and
went
through
Galilee
but
he
did
not
want
anyone
to
get
to
know
about
it
31
For
he
was
teaching
his
disciples
and
telling
them
The
Son
of
man
is
going
to
be
betrayed
into
mens
hands
and
they
will
kill
him
but
despite
being
killed
he
will
rise
three
days
later
32
However
they
did
not
understand
his
statement
and
they
were
afraid
to
question
him
33
And
they
came
into
Capernaum
Now
when
he
was
inside
the
house
he
put
the
question
to
them
What
were
you
arguing
about
on
the
road
34
They
kept
silent
for
on
the
road
they
had
been
arguing
among
themselves
about
who
is
greater
35
So
he
sat
down
and
called
the
Twelve
and
said
to
them
If
anyone
wants
to
be
first
he
must
be
last
of
all
and
minister
of
all
36
Then
he
took
a
young
child
and
stood
him
in
their
midst
and
putting
his
arms
around
him
he
said
to
them
37
Whoever
receives
one
of
such
young
children
on
the
basis
of
my
name
receives
me
also
and
whoever
receives
me
receives
not
me
only
but
also
Him
who
sent
me
38
John
said
to
him
Teacher
we
saw
someone
expelling
demons
by
using
your
name
and
we
tried
to
prevent
him
because
he
was
not
following
us
39
But
Jesus
said
Do
not
try
to
prevent
him
for
there
is
no
one
who
will
do
a
powerful
work
on
the
basis
of
my
name
who
will
quickly
be
able
to
say
anything
bad
about
me
40
For
whoever
is
not
against
us
is
for
us
41
And
whoever
gives
you
a
cup
of
water
to
drink
because
you
belong
to
Christ
I
tell
you
truly
he
will
by
no
means
lose
his
reward
42
But
whoever
stumbles
one
of
these
little
ones
who
have
faith
it
would
be
better
for
him
if
a
millstone
that
is
turned
by
a
donkey
were
put
around
his
neck
and
he
were
pitched
into
the
sea
43
If
ever
your
hand
makes
you
stumble
cut
it
off
It
is
better
for
you
to
enter
into
life
maimed
than
to
go
off
with
two
hands
into
Gehenna
into
the
fire
that
cannot
be
put
out
44
——
45
And
if
your
foot
makes
you
stumble
cut
it
off
It
is
better
for
you
to
enter
into
life
lame
than
to
be
thrown
with
two
feet
into
Gehenna
46
——
47
And
if
your
eye
makes
you
stumble
throw
it
away
It
is
better
for
you
to
enter
one-eyed
into
the
Kingdom
of
God
than
to
be
thrown
with
two
eyes
into
Gehenna
48
where
the
maggot
does
not
die
and
the
fire
is
not
put
out
49
For
everyone
must
be
salted
with
fire
50
Salt
is
fine
but
if
the
salt
ever
loses
its
saltiness
with
what
will
you
season
it
Have
salt
in
yourselves
and
keep
peace
with
one
another
1
From
there
he
got
up
and
came
to
the
borders
of
Judea
across
the
Jordan
and
again
crowds
gathered
to
him
As
he
was
accustomed
to
do
he
again
began
teaching
them
2
And
Pharisees
approached
intent
on
testing
him
and
they
asked
whether
it
was
lawful
for
a
man
to
divorce
a
wife
3
He
answered
them
What
did
Moses
command
you
4
They
said
Moses
allowed
the
writing
of
a
certificate
of
dismissal
and
divorcing
her
5
But
Jesus
said
to
them
Out
of
regard
for
your
hard-heartedness
he
wrote
this
commandment
for
you
6
However
from
the
beginning
of
creation
He
made
them
male
and
female
7
For
this
reason
a
man
will
leave
his
father
and
his
mother
8
and
the
two
will
be
one
flesh

so
that
they
are
no
longer
two
but
one
flesh
9
Therefore
what
God
has
yoked
together
let
no
man
put
apart
10
When
they
were
again
in
the
house
the
disciples
began
to
question
him
about
this
11
He
said
to
them
Whoever
divorces
his
wife
and
marries
another
commits
adultery
against
her
12
and
if
ever
a
woman
after
divorcing
her
husband
marries
another
she
commits
adultery
13
People
now
began
bringing
him
young
children
for
him
to
touch
them
but
the
disciples
reprimanded
them
14
At
seeing
this
Jesus
was
indignant
and
said
to
them
Let
the
young
children
come
to
me
do
not
try
to
stop
them
for
the
Kingdom
of
God
belongs
to
such
ones
15
Truly
I
say
to
you
whoever
does
not
receive
the
Kingdom
of
God
like
a
young
child
will
by
no
means
enter
into
it
16
And
he
took
the
children
into
his
arms
and
began
blessing
them
laying
his
hands
on
them
17
As
he
was
going
on
his
way
a
man
ran
up
and
fell
on
his
knees
before
him
and
put
the
question
to
him
Good
Teacher
what
must
I
do
to
inherit
everlasting
life
18
Jesus
said
to
him
Why
do
you
call
me
good
Nobody
is
good
except
one
God
19
You
know
the
commandments
Do
not
murder
do
not
commit
adultery
do
not
steal
do
not
bear
false
witness
do
not
defraud
honor
your
father
and
your
mother
20
The
man
said
to
him
Teacher
all
these
things
I
have
kept
from
my
youth
on
21
Jesus
looked
at
him
and
felt
love
for
him
and
said
One
thing
is
missing
about
you
Go
sell
what
things
you
have
and
give
to
the
poor
and
you
will
have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
be
my
follower
22
But
he
grew
sad
at
the
answer
and
went
away
grieved
for
he
had
many
possessions
23
After
looking
around
Jesus
said
to
his
disciples
How
difficult
it
will
be
for
those
with
money
to
enter
into
the
Kingdom
of
God
24
But
the
disciples
were
surprised
at
his
words
Jesus
then
responded
Children
how
difficult
it
is
to
enter
into
the
Kingdom
of
God
25
It
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
a
needles
eye
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
Kingdom
of
God
26
They
became
still
more
astounded
and
said
to
him
Who
possibly
can
be
saved
27
Looking
straight
at
them
Jesus
said
With
men
it
is
impossible
but
not
so
with
God
for
all
things
are
possible
with
God
28
Peter
began
to
say
to
him
Look
We
have
left
all
things
and
followed
you
29
Jesus
said
Truly
I
say
to
you
no
one
has
left
house
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
mother
or
father
or
children
or
fields
for
my
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
the
good
news
30
who
will
not
get
100
times
more
now
in
this
period
of
time—houses
brothers
sisters
mothers
children
and
fields
with
persecutions—and
in
the
coming
system
of
things
everlasting
life
31
But
many
who
are
first
will
be
last
and
the
last
first
32
Now
they
were
going
on
the
road
up
to
Jerusalem
and
Jesus
was
going
ahead
of
them
and
they
were
astonished
but
those
who
followed
began
to
fear
Once
again
he
took
the
Twelve
aside
and
started
to
tell
them
these
things
that
were
about
to
happen
to
him
33
Look
We
are
going
up
to
Jerusalem
and
the
Son
of
man
will
be
handed
over
to
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
They
will
condemn
him
to
death
and
hand
him
over
to
men
of
the
nations
34
and
these
will
mock
him
and
spit
on
him
and
scourge
him
and
kill
him
but
three
days
later
he
will
rise
35
James
and
John
the
sons
of
Zebedee
approached
him
and
said
to
him
Teacher
we
want
you
to
do
for
us
whatever
we
ask
of
you
36
He
said
to
them
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
for
you
37
They
replied
Grant
us
to
sit
down
one
at
your
right
hand
and
one
at
your
left
in
your
glory
38
But
Jesus
said
to
them
You
do
not
know
what
you
are
asking
for
Can
you
drink
the
cup
that
I
am
drinking
or
be
baptized
with
the
baptism
with
which
I
am
being
baptized
39
They
said
to
him
We
can
At
that
Jesus
said
to
them
The
cup
I
am
drinking
you
will
drink
and
with
the
baptism
with
which
I
am
being
baptized
you
will
be
baptized
40
However
to
sit
down
at
my
right
hand
or
at
my
left
is
not
mine
to
give
but
it
belongs
to
those
for
whom
it
has
been
prepared
41
When
the
ten
others
heard
about
it
they
became
indignant
at
James
and
John
42
But
Jesus
called
them
to
him
and
said
to
them
You
know
that
those
who
appear
to
be
ruling
the
nations
lord
it
over
them
and
their
great
ones
wield
authority
over
them
43
This
must
not
be
the
way
among
you
but
whoever
wants
to
become
great
among
you
must
be
your
minister
44
and
whoever
wants
to
be
first
among
you
must
be
the
slave
of
all
45
For
even
the
Son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
to
but
to
minister
and
to
give
his
life
as
a
ransom
in
exchange
for
many
46
They
then
came
into
Jericho
But
as
he
and
his
disciples
and
a
considerable
crowd
were
going
out
of
Jericho
Bartimaeus
the
son
of
Timaeus
a
blind
beggar
was
sitting
beside
the
road
47
When
he
heard
that
it
was
Jesus
the
Nazarene
he
started
shouting
and
saying
Son
of
David
Jesus
have
mercy
on
me
48
At
this
many
began
rebuking
him
telling
him
to
be
silent
but
all
the
more
he
kept
shouting
Son
of
David
have
mercy
on
me
49
So
Jesus
stopped
and
said
Call
him
to
me
So
they
called
the
blind
man
saying
to
him
Take
courage
Get
up
he
is
calling
you
50
Throwing
off
his
outer
garment
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
went
to
Jesus
51
Then
Jesus
said
to
him
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
for
you
The
blind
man
said
to
him
Rabboni
let
me
recover
my
sight
52
And
Jesus
said
to
him
Go
Your
faith
has
made
you
well
And
immediately
he
recovered
his
sight
and
he
began
to
follow
him
on
the
road
1
Now
when
they
were
getting
near
to
Jerusalem
to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
at
the
Mount
of
Olives
he
sent
two
of
his
disciples
2
and
told
them
Go
into
the
village
that
is
within
sight
and
as
soon
as
you
enter
it
you
will
find
a
colt
tied
on
which
no
man
has
sat
until
now
Untie
it
and
bring
it
here
3
And
if
anyone
says
to
you
Why
are
you
doing
this
say
The
Lord
needs
it
and
will
send
it
back
here
right
away
4
So
they
went
away
and
found
the
colt
tied
at
a
door
outside
on
the
side
street
and
they
untied
it
5
But
some
of
those
standing
there
said
to
them
What
are
you
doing
untying
the
colt
6
They
told
them
just
what
Jesus
had
said
and
they
let
them
go
7
And
they
brought
the
colt
to
Jesus
and
they
put
their
outer
garments
on
it
and
he
sat
on
it
8
Also
many
spread
their
outer
garments
on
the
road
but
others
cut
down
foliage
from
the
fields
9
And
those
going
in
front
and
those
coming
behind
kept
shouting
Save
we
pray
Blessed
is
the
one
who
comes
in
Jehovahs
name
10
Blessed
is
the
coming
Kingdom
of
our
father
David
Save
we
pray
in
the
heights
above
11
And
he
entered
Jerusalem
and
went
into
the
temple
and
he
looked
around
at
everything
but
since
the
hour
was
already
late
he
went
out
to
Bethany
with
the
Twelve
12
The
next
day
when
they
were
leaving
Bethany
he
felt
hungry
13
From
a
distance
he
caught
sight
of
a
fig
tree
that
had
leaves
and
he
went
to
see
whether
he
could
find
something
on
it
But
on
coming
to
it
he
found
nothing
but
leaves
for
it
was
not
the
season
for
figs
14
So
he
said
to
it
Let
no
one
eat
fruit
from
you
ever
again
And
his
disciples
were
listening
15
They
now
came
to
Jerusalem
There
he
entered
the
temple
and
started
to
throw
out
those
selling
and
buying
in
the
temple
and
he
overturned
the
tables
of
the
money
changers
and
the
benches
of
those
selling
doves
16
and
he
would
not
let
anyone
carry
a
utensil
through
the
temple
17
He
was
teaching
and
saying
to
them
Is
it
not
written
My
house
will
be
called
a
house
of
prayer
for
all
the
nations
But
you
have
made
it
a
cave
of
robbers
18
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
heard
it
and
they
began
to
seek
how
to
kill
him
for
they
were
in
fear
of
him
because
all
the
crowd
was
astounded
at
his
teaching
19
When
it
became
late
in
the
day
they
went
out
of
the
city
20
But
when
they
were
passing
by
early
in
the
morning
they
saw
the
fig
tree
already
withered
from
its
roots
21
Peter
remembering
it
said
to
him
Rabbi
see
the
fig
tree
that
you
cursed
has
withered
22
In
reply
Jesus
said
to
them
Have
faith
in
God
23
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
whoever
tells
this
mountain
Be
lifted
up
and
thrown
into
the
sea

and
does
not
doubt
in
his
heart
but
has
faith
that
what
he
says
is
going
to
happen
he
will
have
it
happen
24
This
is
why
I
tell
you
all
the
things
you
pray
and
ask
for
have
faith
that
you
have
received
them
and
you
will
have
them
25
And
when
you
stand
praying
forgive
whatever
you
have
against
anyone
so
that
your
Father
who
is
in
the
heavens
may
also
forgive
you
your
trespasses
26
——
27
They
came
again
to
Jerusalem
And
as
he
was
walking
in
the
temple
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
came
28
and
said
to
him
By
what
authority
do
you
do
these
things
Or
who
gave
you
this
authority
to
do
these
things
29
Jesus
said
to
them
I
will
ask
you
one
question
Answer
me
and
I
will
tell
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things
30
Was
the
baptism
by
John
from
heaven
or
from
men
Answer
me
31
So
they
began
to
reason
among
themselves
saying
If
we
say
From
heaven

he
will
say
Why
then
did
you
not
believe
him
32
But
dare
we
say
From
men
They
were
in
fear
of
the
crowd
for
these
all
held
that
John
had
really
been
a
prophet
33
So
they
answered
Jesus
We
do
not
know
Jesus
said
to
them
Neither
am
I
telling
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things
1
Then
he
started
to
speak
to
them
with
illustrations
A
man
planted
a
vineyard
and
put
a
fence
around
it
and
dug
a
vat
for
the
winepress
and
erected
a
tower
then
he
leased
it
to
cultivators
and
traveled
abroad
2
In
due
season
he
sent
a
slave
to
the
cultivators
to
collect
some
of
the
fruits
of
the
vineyard
from
them
3
But
they
took
him
beat
him
and
sent
him
away
empty-handed
4
Again
he
sent
another
slave
to
them
and
that
one
they
struck
on
the
head
and
dishonored
5
And
he
sent
another
and
that
one
they
killed
and
many
others
some
of
whom
they
beat
and
some
of
whom
they
killed
6
One
more
he
had
a
beloved
son
He
sent
him
to
them
last
saying
They
will
respect
my
son
7
But
those
cultivators
said
among
themselves
This
is
the
heir
Come
let
us
kill
him
and
the
inheritance
will
be
ours
8
So
they
took
him
and
killed
him
and
threw
him
out
of
the
vineyard
9
What
will
the
owner
of
the
vineyard
do
He
will
come
and
kill
the
cultivators
and
will
give
the
vineyard
to
others
10
Did
you
never
read
this
scripture
The
stone
that
the
builders
rejected
this
has
become
the
chief
cornerstone
11
This
has
come
from
Jehovah
and
it
is
marvelous
in
our
eyes
12
At
that
they
wanted
to
seize
him
but
they
feared
the
crowd
for
they
knew
that
he
spoke
the
illustration
with
them
in
mind
So
they
left
him
and
went
away
13
Next
they
sent
to
him
some
of
the
Pharisees
and
of
the
party
followers
of
Herod
in
order
to
catch
him
in
his
speech
14
On
arriving
these
said
to
him
Teacher
we
know
you
are
truthful
and
you
do
not
seek
anyones
favor
for
you
do
not
look
at
the
outward
appearance
of
people
but
you
teach
the
way
of
God
in
line
with
truth
Is
it
lawful
to
pay
head
tax
to
Caesar
or
not
15
Should
we
pay
or
should
we
not
pay
Detecting
their
hypocrisy
he
said
to
them
Why
do
you
put
me
to
the
test
Bring
me
a
denarius
to
look
at
16
They
brought
one
and
he
said
to
them
Whose
image
and
inscription
is
this
They
said
to
him
Caesars
17
Jesus
then
said
Pay
back
Caesars
things
to
Caesar
but
Gods
things
to
God
And
they
were
amazed
at
him
18
Now
the
Sadducees
who
say
there
is
no
resurrection
came
and
asked
him
19
Teacher
Moses
wrote
us
that
if
someones
brother
dies
and
leaves
a
wife
behind
but
does
not
leave
a
child
his
brother
should
take
the
wife
and
raise
up
offspring
for
his
brother
20
There
were
seven
brothers
The
first
took
a
wife
but
when
he
died
he
left
no
offspring
21
And
the
second
married
her
but
died
without
leaving
offspring
and
the
third
the
same
way
22
And
all
seven
left
no
offspring
Last
of
all
the
woman
also
died
23
In
the
resurrection
whose
wife
will
she
be
For
the
seven
had
her
as
a
wife
24
Jesus
said
to
them
Is
not
this
why
you
are
mistaken
because
you
know
neither
the
Scriptures
nor
the
power
of
God
25
For
when
they
rise
from
the
dead
neither
do
men
marry
nor
are
women
given
in
marriage
but
they
are
as
angels
in
the
heavens
26
But
concerning
the
dead
being
raised
up
have
you
not
read
in
the
book
of
Moses
in
the
account
about
the
thornbush
that
God
said
to
him
I
am
the
God
of
Abraham
and
God
of
Isaac
and
God
of
Jacob
27
He
is
a
God
not
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
You
are
very
much
mistaken
28
One
of
the
scribes
who
had
come
up
and
heard
them
disputing
knowing
that
he
had
answered
them
in
a
fine
way
asked
him
Which
commandment
is
first
of
all
29
Jesus
answered
The
first
is
Hear
O
Israel
Jehovah
our
God
is
one
Jehovah
30
and
you
must
love
Jehovah
your
God
with
your
whole
heart
and
with
your
whole
soul
and
with
your
whole
mind
and
with
your
whole
strength
31
The
second
is
this
You
must
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
There
is
no
other
commandment
greater
than
these
32
The
scribe
said
to
him
Teacher
you
spoke
well
in
line
with
truth
He
is
One
and
there
is
no
other
besides
him
33
and
to
love
him
with
ones
whole
heart
with
ones
whole
understanding
and
with
ones
whole
strength
and
to
love
ones
neighbor
as
oneself
is
worth
far
more
than
all
the
whole
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
34
At
this
Jesus
discerning
that
he
had
answered
intelligently
said
to
him
You
are
not
far
from
the
Kingdom
of
God
But
no
one
had
the
courage
to
question
him
anymore
35
However
as
Jesus
continued
teaching
in
the
temple
he
said
How
is
it
that
the
scribes
say
that
the
Christ
is
Davids
son
36
By
the
holy
spirit
David
himself
said
Jehovah
said
to
my
Lord
Sit
at
my
right
hand
until
I
put
your
enemies
beneath
your
feet
37
David
himself
calls
him
Lord
so
how
can
it
be
that
he
is
his
son
And
the
large
crowd
was
listening
to
him
with
pleasure
38
And
in
his
teaching
he
went
on
to
say
Beware
of
the
scribes
who
want
to
walk
around
in
robes
and
want
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
39
and
front
seats
in
the
synagogues
and
the
most
prominent
places
at
evening
meals
40
They
devour
the
houses
of
the
widows
and
for
show
they
make
long
prayers
These
will
receive
a
more
severe
judgment
41
And
he
sat
down
with
the
treasury
chests
in
view
and
began
observing
how
the
crowd
was
dropping
money
into
the
treasury
chests
and
many
rich
people
were
dropping
in
many
coins
42
Now
a
poor
widow
came
and
dropped
in
two
small
coins
of
very
little
value
43
So
he
called
his
disciples
to
him
and
said
to
them
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
this
poor
widow
put
in
more
than
all
the
others
who
put
money
into
the
treasury
chests
44
For
they
all
put
in
out
of
their
surplus
but
she
out
of
her
want
put
in
everything
she
had
all
she
had
to
live
on
1
As
he
was
going
out
of
the
temple
one
of
his
disciples
said
to
him
Teacher
see
what
wonderful
stones
and
buildings
2
However
Jesus
said
to
him
Do
you
see
these
great
buildings
By
no
means
will
a
stone
be
left
here
upon
a
stone
and
not
be
thrown
down
3
As
he
was
sitting
on
the
Mount
of
Olives
with
the
temple
in
view
Peter
James
John
and
Andrew
asked
him
privately
4
Tell
us
when
will
these
things
be
and
what
will
be
the
sign
when
all
these
things
are
to
come
to
a
conclusion
5
So
Jesus
began
to
tell
them
Look
out
that
nobody
misleads
you
6
Many
will
come
on
the
basis
of
my
name
saying
I
am
he

and
will
mislead
many
7
Moreover
when
you
hear
of
wars
and
reports
of
wars
do
not
be
alarmed
these
things
must
take
place
but
the
end
is
not
yet
8
For
nation
will
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
there
will
be
earthquakes
in
one
place
after
another
there
will
also
be
food
shortages
These
are
a
beginning
of
pangs
of
distress
9
As
for
you
look
out
for
yourselves
People
will
hand
you
over
to
local
courts
and
you
will
be
beaten
in
synagogues
and
be
put
on
the
stand
before
governors
and
kings
for
my
sake
for
a
witness
to
them
10
Also
in
all
the
nations
the
good
news
has
to
be
preached
first
11
And
when
they
are
taking
you
to
hand
you
over
do
not
be
anxious
beforehand
about
what
to
say
but
whatever
is
given
you
in
that
hour
say
this
for
you
are
not
the
ones
speaking
but
the
holy
spirit
is
12
Furthermore
brother
will
deliver
brother
over
to
death
and
a
father
a
child
and
children
will
rise
up
against
parents
and
have
them
put
to
death
13
And
you
will
be
hated
by
all
people
on
account
of
my
name
But
the
one
who
has
endured
to
the
end
will
be
saved
14
However
when
you
catch
sight
of
the
disgusting
thing
that
causes
desolation
standing
where
it
should
not
be
let
the
reader
use
discernment
then
let
those
in
Judea
begin
fleeing
to
the
mountains
15
Let
the
man
on
the
housetop
not
come
down
nor
go
inside
to
take
anything
out
of
his
house
16
and
let
the
man
in
the
field
not
return
to
the
things
behind
to
pick
up
his
outer
garment
17
Woe
to
the
pregnant
women
and
those
nursing
a
baby
in
those
days
18
Keep
praying
that
it
may
not
occur
in
wintertime
19
for
those
days
will
be
days
of
a
tribulation
such
as
has
not
occurred
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
that
God
created
until
that
time
and
will
not
occur
again
20
In
fact
unless
Jehovah
had
cut
short
the
days
no
flesh
would
be
saved
But
on
account
of
the
chosen
ones
whom
he
has
chosen
he
has
cut
short
the
days
21
Then
too
if
anyone
says
to
you
See
Here
is
the
Christ

or
See
There
he
is

do
not
believe
it
22
For
false
Christs
and
false
prophets
will
arise
and
will
perform
signs
and
wonders
to
lead
astray
if
possible
the
chosen
ones
23
You
then
watch
out
I
have
told
you
all
things
beforehand
24
But
in
those
days
after
that
tribulation
the
sun
will
be
darkened
and
the
moon
will
not
give
its
light
25
and
the
stars
will
be
falling
out
of
heaven
and
the
powers
that
are
in
the
heavens
will
be
shaken
26
And
then
they
will
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
with
great
power
and
glory
27
And
then
he
will
send
out
the
angels
and
will
gather
his
chosen
ones
together
from
the
four
winds
from
earths
extremity
to
heavens
extremity
28
Now
learn
this
illustration
from
the
fig
tree
Just
as
soon
as
its
young
branch
grows
tender
and
sprouts
its
leaves
you
know
that
summer
is
near
29
Likewise
also
you
when
you
see
these
things
happening
know
that
he
is
near
at
the
doors
30
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
this
generation
will
by
no
means
pass
away
until
all
these
things
happen
31
Heaven
and
earth
will
pass
away
but
my
words
will
by
no
means
pass
away
32
Concerning
that
day
or
the
hour
nobody
knows
neither
the
angels
in
heaven
nor
the
Son
but
the
Father
33
Keep
looking
keep
awake
for
you
do
not
know
when
the
appointed
time
is
34
It
is
like
a
man
traveling
abroad
who
left
his
house
and
gave
the
authority
to
his
slaves
to
each
one
his
work
and
commanded
the
doorkeeper
to
keep
on
the
watch
35
Keep
on
the
watch
therefore
for
you
do
not
know
when
the
master
of
the
house
is
coming
whether
late
in
the
day
or
at
midnight
or
before
dawn
or
early
in
the
morning
36
in
order
that
when
he
comes
suddenly
he
does
not
find
you
sleeping
37
But
what
I
say
to
you
I
say
to
all
Keep
on
the
watch
1
Now
the
Passover
and
the
Festival
of
Unleavened
Bread
was
two
days
later
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
were
looking
for
a
way
to
seize
him
by
cunning
and
kill
him
2
for
they
were
saying
Not
at
the
festival
perhaps
there
might
be
an
uproar
of
the
people
3
And
while
he
was
at
Bethany
dining
in
the
house
of
Simon
the
leper
a
woman
came
with
an
alabaster
jar
of
perfumed
oil
genuine
nard
very
expensive
She
broke
open
the
alabaster
jar
and
began
pouring
it
on
his
head
4
At
this
some
said
to
one
another
indignantly
Why
has
this
perfumed
oil
been
wasted
5
For
this
perfumed
oil
could
have
been
sold
for
more
than
300
denarii
and
the
money
given
to
the
poor
And
they
were
greatly
annoyed
with
her
6
But
Jesus
said
Let
her
alone
Why
do
you
try
to
make
trouble
for
her
She
did
a
fine
deed
toward
me
7
For
you
always
have
the
poor
with
you
and
you
can
do
them
good
whenever
you
want
to
but
you
will
not
always
have
me
8
She
did
what
she
could
she
poured
perfumed
oil
on
my
body
beforehand
in
view
of
the
burial
9
Truly
I
say
to
you
wherever
the
good
news
is
preached
in
all
the
world
what
this
woman
did
will
also
be
told
in
memory
of
her
10
And
Judas
Iscariot
one
of
the
Twelve
went
off
to
the
chief
priests
in
order
to
betray
him
to
them
11
When
they
heard
it
they
were
delighted
and
promised
to
give
him
silver
money
So
he
began
seeking
an
opportunity
to
betray
him
12
Now
on
the
first
day
of
the
Unleavened
Bread
when
they
customarily
offered
up
the
Passover
sacrifice
his
disciples
said
to
him
Where
do
you
want
us
to
go
and
prepare
for
you
to
eat
the
Passover
13
With
that
he
sent
two
of
his
disciples
and
said
to
them
Go
into
the
city
and
a
man
carrying
an
earthenware
water
jar
will
meet
you
Follow
him
14
and
wherever
he
goes
inside
say
to
the
master
of
the
house
The
Teacher
says
Where
is
the
guest
room
where
I
may
eat
the
Passover
with
my
disciples
15
And
he
will
show
you
a
large
upper
room
furnished
and
ready
Prepare
it
for
us
there
16
So
the
disciples
went
out
and
they
entered
the
city
and
found
it
just
as
he
said
to
them
and
they
prepared
for
the
Passover
17
After
evening
had
fallen
he
came
with
the
Twelve
18
And
as
they
were
reclining
at
the
table
and
eating
Jesus
said
Truly
I
say
to
you
one
of
you
who
is
eating
with
me
will
betray
me
19
They
began
to
be
grieved
and
to
say
to
him
one
by
one
It
is
not
I
is
it
20
He
said
to
them
It
is
one
of
the
Twelve
the
one
dipping
with
me
into
the
bowl
21
For
the
Son
of
man
is
going
away
just
as
it
is
written
about
him
but
woe
to
that
man
through
whom
the
Son
of
man
is
betrayed
It
would
have
been
better
for
that
man
if
he
had
not
been
born
22
And
as
they
continued
eating
he
took
a
loaf
said
a
blessing
broke
it
and
gave
it
to
them
saying
Take
it
this
means
my
body
23
And
taking
a
cup
he
offered
thanks
and
gave
it
to
them
and
they
all
drank
out
of
it
24
And
he
said
to
them
This
means
my
blood
of
the
covenant

which
is
to
be
poured
out
in
behalf
of
many
25
Truly
I
say
to
you
I
will
by
no
means
drink
anymore
of
the
product
of
the
vine
until
that
day
when
I
drink
it
new
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
26
Finally
after
singing
praises
they
went
out
to
the
Mount
of
Olives
27
And
Jesus
said
to
them
You
will
all
be
stumbled
for
it
is
written
I
will
strike
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
will
be
scattered
about
28
But
after
I
have
been
raised
up
I
will
go
ahead
of
you
into
Galilee
29
But
Peter
said
to
him
Even
if
all
the
others
are
stumbled
I
will
not
be
30
At
that
Jesus
said
to
him
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
today
yes
on
this
very
night
before
a
rooster
crows
twice
you
will
disown
me
three
times
31
But
he
kept
insisting
If
I
have
to
die
with
you
I
will
by
no
means
disown
you
Also
all
the
others
began
to
say
the
same
thing
32
So
they
came
to
a
spot
named
Gethsemane
and
he
said
to
his
disciples
Sit
down
here
while
I
pray
33
And
he
took
Peter
and
James
and
John
along
with
him
and
he
began
to
feel
deeply
distressed
and
to
be
greatly
troubled
34
He
said
to
them
I
am
deeply
grieved
even
to
death
Stay
here
and
keep
on
the
watch
35
And
going
a
little
way
forward
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
began
praying
that
if
it
were
possible
the
hour
might
pass
away
from
him
36
And
he
said
Abba
Father
all
things
are
possible
for
you
remove
this
cup
from
me
Yet
not
what
I
want
but
what
you
want
37
He
returned
and
found
them
sleeping
and
he
said
to
Peter
Simon
are
you
sleeping
Did
you
not
have
the
strength
to
keep
on
the
watch
for
one
hour
38
Keep
on
the
watch
and
pray
continually
so
that
you
do
not
come
into
temptation
The
spirit
of
course
is
eager
but
the
flesh
is
weak
39
And
he
went
away
again
and
prayed
saying
the
same
thing
40
And
he
came
again
and
found
them
sleeping
for
their
eyes
were
weighed
down
so
they
did
not
know
what
to
answer
him
41
And
he
returned
the
third
time
and
said
to
them
At
such
a
time
as
this
you
are
sleeping
and
resting
It
is
enough
The
hour
has
come
Look
The
Son
of
man
is
being
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
sinners
42
Get
up
let
us
go
Look
My
betrayer
has
drawn
near
43
And
immediately
while
he
was
still
speaking
Judas
one
of
the
Twelve
arrived
and
with
him
a
crowd
with
swords
and
clubs
sent
from
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
44
Now
his
betrayer
had
given
them
an
agreed
sign
saying
Whoever
it
is
I
kiss
he
is
the
one
take
him
into
custody
and
lead
him
away
under
guard
45
And
he
came
straight
up
and
approached
him
and
said
Rabbi
and
gave
him
a
tender
kiss
46
So
they
seized
him
and
took
him
into
custody
47
However
one
of
those
standing
by
drew
his
sword
and
struck
the
slave
of
the
high
priest
taking
off
his
ear
48
But
in
response
Jesus
said
to
them
Did
you
come
out
to
arrest
me
with
swords
and
clubs
as
against
a
robber
49
Day
after
day
I
was
with
you
in
the
temple
teaching
and
yet
you
did
not
take
me
into
custody
Nevertheless
this
is
to
fulfill
the
Scriptures
50
And
they
all
abandoned
him
and
fled
51
However
a
certain
young
man
wearing
only
a
fine
linen
garment
over
his
naked
body
began
to
follow
him
nearby
and
they
tried
to
seize
him
52
but
he
left
his
linen
garment
behind
and
got
away
naked
53
They
now
led
Jesus
away
to
the
high
priest
and
all
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
assembled
54
But
Peter
from
a
good
distance
followed
him
as
far
as
into
the
courtyard
of
the
high
priest
and
he
was
sitting
together
with
the
house
attendants
and
warming
himself
before
a
bright
fire
55
Now
the
chief
priests
and
the
entire
Sanhedrin
were
looking
for
testimony
against
Jesus
in
order
to
put
him
to
death
but
they
were
not
finding
any
56
Many
indeed
were
giving
false
witness
against
him
but
their
testimonies
were
not
in
agreement
57
Also
certain
ones
were
standing
up
and
bearing
false
witness
against
him
saying
58
We
heard
him
say
I
will
throw
down
this
temple
that
was
made
with
hands
and
in
three
days
I
will
build
another
not
made
with
hands
59
But
even
on
these
grounds
their
testimony
was
not
in
agreement
60
Then
the
high
priest
stood
up
in
their
midst
and
questioned
Jesus
saying
Do
you
say
nothing
in
reply
What
is
it
these
men
are
testifying
against
you
61
But
he
kept
silent
and
made
no
reply
at
all
Again
the
high
priest
began
to
question
him
and
said
to
him
Are
you
the
Christ
the
Son
of
the
Blessed
One
62
Then
Jesus
said
I
am
and
you
will
see
the
Son
of
man
sitting
at
the
right
hand
of
power
and
coming
with
the
clouds
of
heaven
63
At
this
the
high
priest
ripped
his
garments
and
said
What
further
need
do
we
have
of
witnesses
64
You
heard
the
blasphemy
What
is
your
decision
They
all
condemned
him
as
deserving
of
death
65
And
some
started
to
spit
on
him
and
to
cover
his
face
and
hit
him
with
their
fists
and
say
to
him
Prophesy
And
slapping
him
in
the
face
the
court
attendants
took
him
66
Now
while
Peter
was
below
in
the
courtyard
one
of
the
servant
girls
of
the
high
priest
came
67
On
seeing
Peter
warming
himself
she
looked
straight
at
him
and
said
You
too
were
with
the
Nazarene
this
Jesus
68
But
he
denied
it
saying
Neither
do
I
know
him
nor
do
I
understand
what
you
are
talking
about

and
he
went
outside
to
the
entryway
69
There
the
servant
girl
saw
him
and
again
began
to
say
to
those
standing
by
This
is
one
of
them
70
Again
he
was
denying
it
And
after
a
little
while
those
standing
by
again
began
saying
to
Peter
Certainly
you
are
one
of
them
for
you
are
in
fact
a
Galilean
71
But
he
started
to
curse
and
swear
I
do
not
know
this
man
of
whom
you
speak
72
Immediately
a
rooster
crowed
a
second
time
and
Peter
recalled
what
Jesus
had
said
to
him
Before
a
rooster
crows
twice
you
will
disown
me
three
times
And
he
broke
down
and
began
to
weep
1
Immediately
at
dawn
the
chief
priests
with
the
elders
and
the
scribes
indeed
the
whole
Sanhedrin
consulted
together
and
they
bound
Jesus
and
led
him
off
and
handed
him
over
to
Pilate
2
So
Pilate
put
the
question
to
him
Are
you
the
King
of
the
Jews
In
answer
he
said
You
yourself
say
it
3
But
the
chief
priests
were
accusing
him
of
many
things
4
Now
Pilate
began
questioning
him
again
saying
Have
you
no
reply
to
make
See
how
many
charges
they
are
bringing
against
you
5
But
Jesus
made
no
further
answer
so
that
Pilate
was
amazed
6
Well
from
festival
to
festival
he
used
to
release
to
them
one
prisoner
whom
they
requested
7
At
the
time
the
man
named
Barabbas
was
in
prison
with
the
seditionists
who
in
their
sedition
had
committed
murder
8
So
the
crowd
came
up
and
began
to
make
their
request
according
to
what
Pilate
used
to
do
for
them
9
He
responded
to
them
saying
Do
you
want
me
to
release
to
you
the
King
of
the
Jews
10
For
Pilate
was
aware
that
out
of
envy
the
chief
priests
had
handed
him
over
11
But
the
chief
priests
stirred
up
the
crowd
to
have
him
release
Barabbas
to
them
instead
12
Again
in
reply
Pilate
said
to
them
What
then
should
I
do
with
the
one
you
call
the
King
of
the
Jews
13
Once
more
they
cried
out
To
the
stake
with
him
14
But
Pilate
went
on
to
say
to
them
Why
What
bad
thing
did
he
do
Still
they
cried
out
all
the
more
To
the
stake
with
him
15
At
that
Pilate
wishing
to
satisfy
the
crowd
released
Barabbas
to
them
and
after
having
Jesus
whipped
he
handed
him
over
to
be
executed
on
the
stake
16
The
soldiers
now
led
him
off
into
the
courtyard
that
is
into
the
governors
residence
and
they
called
the
whole
body
of
troops
together
17
And
they
dressed
him
in
purple
and
braided
a
crown
of
thorns
and
put
it
on
him
18
and
they
began
to
call
out
to
him
Greetings
you
King
of
the
Jews
19
Also
they
were
hitting
him
on
the
head
with
a
reed
and
spitting
on
him
and
they
got
on
their
knees
and
bowed
down
to
him
20
Finally
after
they
had
mocked
him
they
stripped
him
of
the
purple
and
put
his
outer
garments
on
him
And
they
led
him
out
to
nail
him
to
the
stake
21
Also
they
compelled
into
service
a
passerby
a
certain
Simon
of
Cyrene
coming
from
the
countryside
the
father
of
Alexander
and
Rufus
to
carry
his
torture
stake
22
So
they
brought
him
to
the
place
called
Golgotha
which
means
when
translated
Skull
Place
23
Here
they
tried
to
give
him
wine
drugged
with
myrrh
but
he
would
not
take
it
24
And
they
nailed
him
to
the
stake
and
distributed
his
outer
garments
by
casting
lots
over
them
to
decide
who
would
take
what
25
It
was
now
the
third
hour
and
they
nailed
him
to
the
stake
26
And
the
inscription
of
the
charge
against
him
was
written
The
King
of
the
Jews
27
Moreover
they
put
two
robbers
on
stakes
alongside
him
one
on
his
right
and
one
on
his
left
28
——
29
And
those
passing
by
spoke
abusively
to
him
shaking
their
heads
and
saying
Ha
You
who
would
throw
down
the
temple
and
build
it
in
three
days
30
save
yourself
by
coming
down
off
the
torture
stake
31
In
the
same
way
also
the
chief
priests
with
the
scribes
were
mocking
him
among
themselves
saying
Others
he
saved
himself
he
cannot
save
32
Let
the
Christ
the
King
of
Israel
now
come
down
off
the
torture
stake
so
that
we
may
see
and
believe
Even
those
who
were
on
stakes
alongside
him
were
reproaching
him
33
When
it
became
the
sixth
hour
a
darkness
fell
over
all
the
land
until
the
ninth
hour
34
And
at
the
ninth
hour
Jesus
called
out
with
a
loud
voice
Eli
Eli
lama
sabachthani
which
means
when
translated
My
God
my
God
why
have
you
forsaken
me
35
And
some
of
those
standing
near
on
hearing
it
began
to
say
See
He
is
calling
Elijah
36
Then
someone
ran
soaked
a
sponge
in
sour
wine
put
it
on
a
reed
and
gave
it
to
him
to
drink
saying
Let
him
be
Let
us
see
whether
Elijah
comes
to
take
him
down
37
But
Jesus
let
out
a
loud
cry
and
expired
38
And
the
curtain
of
the
sanctuary
was
torn
in
two
from
top
to
bottom
39
Now
when
the
army
officer
who
was
standing
by
with
him
in
view
saw
that
he
had
expired
under
these
circumstances
he
said
Certainly
this
man
was
Gods
Son
40
There
were
also
women
watching
from
a
distance
among
them
Mary
Magdalene
as
well
as
Mary
the
mother
of
James
the
Less
and
of
Joses
and
Salome
41
who
used
to
accompany
him
and
minister
to
him
when
he
was
in
Galilee
and
many
other
women
who
had
come
up
together
with
him
to
Jerusalem
42
Now
as
it
was
already
late
in
the
afternoon
and
since
it
was
Preparation
that
is
the
day
before
the
Sabbath
43
there
came
Joseph
of
Arimathea
a
reputable
member
of
the
Council
who
also
himself
was
waiting
for
the
Kingdom
of
God
He
took
courage
and
went
in
before
Pilate
and
asked
for
the
body
of
Jesus
44
But
Pilate
wondered
whether
he
could
already
be
dead
and
summoning
the
army
officer
he
asked
him
whether
Jesus
had
already
died
45
So
after
making
certain
from
the
army
officer
he
granted
the
body
to
Joseph
46
After
he
bought
fine
linen
and
took
him
down
he
wrapped
him
in
the
fine
linen
and
laid
him
in
a
tomb
that
was
quarried
out
of
rock
then
he
rolled
a
stone
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
tomb
47
But
Mary
Magdalene
and
Mary
the
mother
of
Joses
continued
looking
at
where
he
had
been
laid
1
So
when
the
Sabbath
was
over
Mary
Magdalene
Mary
the
mother
of
James
and
Salome
bought
spices
in
order
to
come
and
apply
them
to
his
body
2
And
very
early
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
when
the
sun
had
risen
they
came
to
the
tomb
3
They
were
saying
to
one
another
Who
will
roll
the
stone
away
from
the
entrance
of
the
tomb
for
us
4
But
when
they
looked
up
they
saw
that
the
stone
had
been
rolled
away
although
it
was
very
large
5
When
they
entered
into
the
tomb
they
saw
a
young
man
sitting
on
the
right
side
clothed
in
a
white
robe
and
they
were
stunned
6
He
said
to
them
Do
not
be
stunned
You
are
looking
for
Jesus
the
Nazarene
who
was
executed
on
the
stake
He
was
raised
up
He
is
not
here
Look
here
is
the
place
where
they
laid
him
7
But
go
tell
his
disciples
and
Peter
He
is
going
ahead
of
you
into
Galilee
You
will
see
him
there
just
as
he
told
you
8
So
when
they
came
out
they
fled
from
the
tomb
trembling
and
overwhelmed
with
emotion
And
they
said
nothing
to
anyone
for
they
were
in
fear
1
Seeing
that
many
have
undertaken
to
compile
an
account
of
the
facts
that
are
given
full
credence
among
us
2
just
as
these
were
handed
down
to
us
by
those
who
from
the
beginning
were
eyewitnesses
and
attendants
of
the
message
3
I
resolved
also
because
I
have
traced
all
things
from
the
start
with
accuracy
to
write
them
to
you
in
logical
order
most
excellent
Theophilus
4
so
that
you
may
know
fully
the
certainty
of
the
things
that
you
have
been
taught
orally
5
In
the
days
of
Herod
king
of
Judea
there
was
a
priest
named
Zechariah
of
the
division
of
Abijah
His
wife
was
from
the
daughters
of
Aaron
and
her
name
was
Elizabeth
6
They
both
were
righteous
before
God
walking
blamelessly
in
accord
with
all
the
commandments
and
legal
requirements
of
Jehovah
7
But
they
had
no
child
because
Elizabeth
was
barren
and
they
both
were
well
along
in
years
8
Now
as
he
was
serving
as
priest
in
the
assignment
of
his
division
before
God
9
according
to
the
established
practice
of
the
priesthood
it
became
his
turn
to
offer
incense
when
he
entered
into
the
sanctuary
of
Jehovah
10
And
the
entire
multitude
of
the
people
were
praying
outside
at
the
hour
of
offering
incense
11
Jehovahs
angel
appeared
to
him
standing
at
the
right
side
of
the
incense
altar
12
But
Zechariah
became
troubled
at
the
sight
and
he
was
overcome
with
fear
13
However
the
angel
said
to
him
Do
not
be
afraid
Zechariah
because
your
supplication
has
been
favorably
heard
and
your
wife
Elizabeth
will
bear
you
a
son
and
you
are
to
name
him
John
14
You
will
have
joy
and
great
gladness
and
many
will
rejoice
over
his
birth
15
for
he
will
be
great
in
the
sight
of
Jehovah
But
he
must
drink
no
wine
or
any
alcoholic
drink
at
all
and
he
will
be
filled
with
holy
spirit
even
from
before
birth
16
and
he
will
turn
back
many
of
the
sons
of
Israel
to
Jehovah
their
God
17
Also
he
will
go
ahead
of
him
with
Elijahs
spirit
and
power
to
turn
back
the
hearts
of
fathers
to
children
and
the
disobedient
ones
to
the
practical
wisdom
of
righteous
ones
in
order
to
get
ready
for
Jehovah
a
prepared
people
18
Zechariah
said
to
the
angel
How
can
I
be
sure
of
this
For
I
am
old
and
my
wife
is
well
along
in
years
19
In
reply
the
angel
said
to
him
I
am
Gabriel
who
stands
near
before
God
and
I
was
sent
to
speak
with
you
and
to
declare
this
good
news
to
you
20
But
look
you
will
be
silent
and
unable
to
speak
until
the
day
these
things
take
place
because
you
did
not
believe
my
words
which
will
be
fulfilled
in
their
appointed
time
21
Meanwhile
the
people
continued
waiting
for
Zechariah
and
they
were
surprised
that
he
delayed
so
long
in
the
sanctuary
22
When
he
came
out
he
was
unable
to
speak
to
them
and
they
perceived
that
he
had
just
seen
a
supernatural
sight
in
the
sanctuary
He
kept
making
signs
to
them
but
remained
speechless
23
When
the
days
of
his
holy
service
were
completed
he
went
off
to
his
home
24
Some
days
later
Elizabeth
his
wife
became
pregnant
and
she
kept
herself
secluded
for
five
months
saying
25
This
is
how
Jehovah
has
dealt
with
me
in
these
days
He
has
turned
his
attention
to
me
to
take
away
my
reproach
among
men
26
In
her
sixth
month
the
angel
Gabriel
was
sent
from
God
to
a
city
of
Galilee
named
Nazareth
27
to
a
virgin
promised
in
marriage
to
a
man
named
Joseph
of
Davids
house
and
the
name
of
the
virgin
was
Mary
28
And
coming
in
the
angel
said
to
her
Greetings
you
highly
favored
one
Jehovah
is
with
you
29
But
she
was
deeply
disturbed
at
his
words
and
tried
to
understand
what
kind
of
greeting
this
might
be
30
So
the
angel
said
to
her
Do
not
be
afraid
Mary
for
you
have
found
favor
with
God
31
And
look
you
will
become
pregnant
and
give
birth
to
a
son
and
you
are
to
name
him
Jesus
32
This
one
will
be
great
and
will
be
called
Son
of
the
Most
High
and
Jehovah
God
will
give
him
the
throne
of
David
his
father
33
and
he
will
rule
as
King
over
the
house
of
Jacob
forever
and
there
will
be
no
end
to
his
Kingdom
34
But
Mary
said
to
the
angel
How
is
this
to
be
since
I
am
not
having
sexual
relations
with
a
man
35
In
answer
the
angel
said
to
her
Holy
spirit
will
come
upon
you
and
power
of
the
Most
High
will
overshadow
you
And
for
that
reason
the
one
who
is
born
will
be
called
holy
Gods
Son
36
And
look
Elizabeth
your
relative
has
also
conceived
a
son
in
her
old
age
and
this
is
the
sixth
month
for
her
the
so-called
barren
woman
37
for
no
declaration
will
be
impossible
for
God
38
Then
Mary
said
Look
Jehovahs
slave
girl
May
it
happen
to
me
according
to
your
declaration
At
that
the
angel
departed
from
her
39
So
Mary
set
out
in
those
days
and
traveled
with
haste
into
the
mountainous
country
to
a
city
of
Judah
40
and
she
entered
the
home
of
Zechariah
and
greeted
Elizabeth
41
Well
as
Elizabeth
heard
the
greeting
of
Mary
the
infant
in
her
womb
leaped
and
Elizabeth
was
filled
with
holy
spirit
42
and
loudly
cried
out
Blessed
are
you
among
women
and
blessed
is
the
fruitage
of
your
womb
43
So
how
is
it
that
this
privilege
is
mine
to
have
the
mother
of
my
Lord
come
to
me
44
For
look
as
the
sound
of
your
greeting
reached
my
ears
the
infant
in
my
womb
leaped
for
joy
45
Happy
too
is
she
who
believed
for
there
will
be
a
complete
fulfillment
of
those
things
spoken
to
her
from
Jehovah
46
And
Mary
said
My
soul
magnifies
Jehovah
47
and
my
spirit
cannot
keep
from
being
overjoyed
at
God
my
Savior
48
because
he
has
looked
upon
the
low
position
of
his
slave
girl
For
look
from
now
on
all
generations
will
declare
me
happy
49
because
the
powerful
One
has
done
great
deeds
for
me
and
holy
is
his
name
50
and
for
generation
after
generation
his
mercy
is
upon
those
who
fear
him
51
He
has
acted
mightily
with
his
arm
he
has
scattered
those
who
are
haughty
in
the
intention
of
their
hearts
52
He
has
brought
down
powerful
men
from
thrones
and
has
exalted
lowly
ones
53
he
has
fully
satisfied
hungry
ones
with
good
things
and
has
sent
away
empty-handed
those
who
had
wealth
54
He
has
come
to
the
aid
of
Israel
his
servant
remembering
his
mercy
55
just
as
he
spoke
to
our
forefathers
to
Abraham
and
to
his
offspring
forever
56
Mary
stayed
with
her
about
three
months
and
then
returned
to
her
own
home
57
The
time
now
came
for
Elizabeth
to
give
birth
and
she
gave
birth
to
a
son
58
And
the
neighbors
and
her
relatives
heard
that
Jehovah
had
magnified
his
mercy
to
her
and
they
rejoiced
with
her
59
On
the
eighth
day
they
came
to
circumcise
the
young
child
and
they
were
going
to
name
him
after
his
father
Zechariah
60
But
his
mother
said
in
reply
No
but
he
will
be
called
John
61
At
this
they
said
to
her
Not
one
of
your
relatives
is
called
by
this
name
62
Then
they
asked
his
father
by
signs
what
he
wanted
him
to
be
called
63
So
he
asked
for
a
tablet
and
wrote
John
is
his
name
At
this
they
were
all
amazed
64
Instantly
his
mouth
was
opened
and
his
tongue
was
set
free
and
he
began
to
speak
praising
God
65
And
fear
fell
upon
all
those
living
in
their
neighborhood
and
all
these
things
began
to
be
talked
about
in
the
whole
mountainous
country
of
Judea
66
And
all
who
heard
noted
it
in
their
hearts
saying
What
will
this
young
child
turn
out
to
be
For
the
hand
of
Jehovah
was
indeed
with
him
67
Then
Zechariah
his
father
was
filled
with
holy
spirit
and
he
prophesied
saying
68
Let
Jehovah
be
praised
the
God
of
Israel
because
he
has
turned
his
attention
to
his
people
and
has
brought
them
deliverance
69
And
he
has
raised
up
a
horn
of
salvation
for
us
in
the
house
of
David
his
servant
70
just
as
he
has
spoken
through
the
mouth
of
his
holy
prophets
from
of
old
71
of
a
salvation
from
our
enemies
and
from
the
hand
of
all
those
hating
us
72
to
show
mercy
in
connection
with
our
forefathers
and
to
call
to
mind
his
holy
covenant
73
the
oath
that
he
swore
to
Abraham
our
forefather
74
to
grant
us
after
we
have
been
rescued
from
the
hands
of
enemies
the
privilege
of
fearlessly
rendering
sacred
service
to
him
75
with
loyalty
and
righteousness
before
him
all
our
days
76
But
as
for
you
young
child
you
will
be
called
a
prophet
of
the
Most
High
for
you
will
go
ahead
of
Jehovah
to
prepare
his
ways
77
to
give
knowledge
of
salvation
to
his
people
by
forgiveness
of
their
sins
78
because
of
the
tender
compassion
of
our
God
With
this
compassion
a
daybreak
will
visit
us
from
on
high
79
to
give
light
to
those
sitting
in
darkness
and
deaths
shadow
and
to
guide
our
feet
in
the
way
of
peace
80
And
the
young
child
grew
up
and
became
strong
in
spirit
and
he
continued
in
the
desert
until
the
day
he
showed
himself
openly
to
Israel
1
Now
in
those
days
a
decree
went
out
from
Caesar
Augustus
for
all
the
inhabited
earth
to
be
registered
2
This
first
registration
took
place
when
Quirinius
was
governor
of
Syria
3
And
all
the
people
went
to
be
registered
each
one
to
his
own
city
4
Of
course
Joseph
also
went
up
from
Galilee
from
the
city
of
Nazareth
into
Judea
to
Davids
city
which
is
called
Bethlehem
because
of
his
being
a
member
of
the
house
and
family
of
David
5
He
went
to
get
registered
with
Mary
who
had
been
given
him
in
marriage
as
promised
and
who
was
soon
to
give
birth
6
While
they
were
there
the
time
came
for
her
to
give
birth
7
And
she
gave
birth
to
her
son
the
firstborn
and
she
wrapped
him
in
strips
of
cloth
and
laid
him
in
a
manger
because
there
was
no
room
for
them
in
the
lodging
place
8
There
were
also
in
the
same
region
shepherds
living
out
of
doors
and
keeping
watch
in
the
night
over
their
flocks
9
Suddenly
Jehovahs
angel
stood
before
them
and
Jehovahs
glory
gleamed
around
them
and
they
became
very
fearful
10
But
the
angel
said
to
them
Do
not
be
afraid
for
look
I
am
declaring
to
you
good
news
of
a
great
joy
that
all
the
people
will
have
11
For
today
there
was
born
to
you
in
Davids
city
a
savior
who
is
Christ
the
Lord
12
And
this
is
a
sign
for
you
You
will
find
an
infant
wrapped
in
strips
of
cloth
and
lying
in
a
manger
13
Suddenly
there
was
with
the
angel
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
army
praising
God
and
saying
14
Glory
in
the
heights
above
to
God
and
on
earth
peace
among
men
of
goodwill
15
So
when
the
angels
had
departed
from
them
into
heaven
the
shepherds
began
saying
to
one
another
Let
us
by
all
means
go
over
to
Bethlehem
and
see
what
has
taken
place
which
Jehovah
has
made
known
to
us
16
And
they
went
quickly
and
found
Mary
as
well
as
Joseph
and
the
infant
lying
in
the
manger
17
When
they
saw
this
they
made
known
the
message
that
they
had
been
told
concerning
this
young
child
18
And
all
who
heard
were
astonished
at
what
the
shepherds
told
them
19
but
Mary
began
to
preserve
all
these
sayings
drawing
conclusions
in
her
heart
20
Then
the
shepherds
went
back
glorifying
and
praising
God
for
all
they
had
heard
and
seen
just
as
it
had
been
told
to
them
21
After
eight
days
when
it
was
time
to
circumcise
him
he
was
named
Jesus
the
name
given
by
the
angel
before
he
was
conceived
22
Also
when
the
time
came
for
purifying
them
according
to
the
Law
of
Moses
they
brought
him
up
to
Jerusalem
to
present
him
to
Jehovah
23
just
as
it
is
written
in
Jehovahs
Law
Every
firstborn
male
must
be
called
holy
to
Jehovah
24
And
they
offered
a
sacrifice
according
to
what
is
said
in
the
Law
of
Jehovah
a
pair
of
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
25
And
look
there
was
a
man
in
Jerusalem
named
Simeon
and
this
man
was
righteous
and
devout
waiting
for
Israels
consolation
and
holy
spirit
was
upon
him
26
Furthermore
it
had
been
divinely
revealed
to
him
by
the
holy
spirit
that
he
would
not
see
death
before
he
had
seen
the
Christ
of
Jehovah
27
Under
the
power
of
the
spirit
he
now
came
into
the
temple
and
as
the
parents
brought
the
young
child
Jesus
in
to
do
for
him
according
to
the
customary
practice
of
the
Law
28
he
took
the
child
into
his
arms
and
praised
God
and
said
29
Now
Sovereign
Lord
you
are
letting
your
slave
go
in
peace
according
to
your
declaration
30
because
my
eyes
have
seen
your
means
of
salvation
31
that
you
have
prepared
in
the
sight
of
all
the
peoples
32
a
light
for
removing
the
veil
from
the
nations
and
a
glory
of
your
people
Israel
33
And
the
childs
father
and
mother
continued
wondering
at
the
things
being
spoken
about
him
34
Also
Simeon
blessed
them
and
said
to
Mary
the
childs
mother
Look
This
child
is
appointed
for
the
falling
and
the
rising
again
of
many
in
Israel
and
for
a
sign
to
be
spoken
against
35
yes
a
long
sword
will
be
run
through
you
in
order
that
the
reasonings
of
many
hearts
may
be
revealed
36
Now
there
was
a
prophetess
Anna
the
daughter
of
Phanuel
of
Ashers
tribe
This
woman
was
well
along
in
years
and
had
lived
with
her
husband
for
seven
years
after
they
were
married
37
and
she
was
a
widow
now
84
years
old
She
was
never
missing
from
the
temple
rendering
sacred
service
night
and
day
with
fasting
and
supplications
38
In
that
very
hour
she
came
near
and
began
giving
thanks
to
God
and
speaking
about
the
child
to
all
who
were
waiting
for
Jerusalems
deliverance
39
So
when
they
had
carried
out
all
the
things
according
to
the
Law
of
Jehovah
they
went
back
into
Galilee
to
their
own
city
Nazareth
40
And
the
young
child
continued
growing
and
getting
strong
being
filled
with
wisdom
and
Gods
favor
continued
upon
him
41
Now
his
parents
were
accustomed
to
go
from
year
to
year
to
Jerusalem
for
the
festival
of
the
Passover
42
And
when
he
was
12
years
old
they
went
up
according
to
the
custom
of
the
festival
43
When
the
days
of
the
festival
were
over
and
they
were
returning
the
boy
Jesus
remained
behind
in
Jerusalem
and
his
parents
did
not
notice
it
44
Assuming
that
he
was
in
the
group
traveling
together
they
went
a
days
journey
and
then
began
to
search
for
him
among
the
relatives
and
acquaintances
45
But
not
finding
him
they
returned
to
Jerusalem
and
made
a
diligent
search
for
him
46
Well
after
three
days
they
found
him
in
the
temple
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
teachers
and
listening
to
them
and
asking
them
questions
47
But
all
those
listening
to
him
were
in
constant
amazement
at
his
understanding
and
his
answers
48
Now
when
his
parents
saw
him
they
were
astounded
and
his
mother
said
to
him
Child
why
did
you
treat
us
this
way
Here
your
father
and
I
have
been
frantically
looking
for
you
49
But
he
said
to
them
Why
were
you
looking
for
me
Did
you
not
know
that
I
must
be
in
the
house
of
my
Father
50
However
they
did
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
to
them
51
Then
he
went
down
with
them
and
returned
to
Nazareth
and
he
continued
subject
to
them
Also
his
mother
carefully
kept
all
these
sayings
in
her
heart
52
And
Jesus
went
on
progressing
in
wisdom
and
in
physical
growth
and
in
favor
with
God
and
men
1
In
the
15th
year
of
the
reign
of
Tiberius
Caesar
when
Pontius
Pilate
was
governor
of
Judea
Herod
was
district
ruler
of
Galilee
Philip
his
brother
was
district
ruler
of
the
country
of
Ituraea
and
Trachonitis
and
Lysanias
was
district
ruler
of
Abilene
2
in
the
days
of
chief
priest
Annas
and
of
Caiaphas
Gods
declaration
came
to
John
the
son
of
Zechariah
in
the
wilderness
3
So
he
went
into
all
the
country
around
the
Jordan
preaching
baptism
in
symbol
of
repentance
for
forgiveness
of
sins
4
just
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
words
of
Isaiah
the
prophet
A
voice
of
one
crying
out
in
the
wilderness
Prepare
the
way
of
Jehovah
Make
his
roads
straight
5
Every
valley
must
be
filled
up
and
every
mountain
and
hill
leveled
the
crooked
ways
must
become
straight
and
the
rough
ways
smooth
6
and
all
flesh
will
see
the
salvation
of
God
7
So
he
began
to
say
to
the
crowds
coming
out
to
be
baptized
by
him
You
offspring
of
vipers
who
has
warned
you
to
flee
from
the
coming
wrath
8
Therefore
produce
fruits
that
befit
repentance
Do
not
start
saying
to
yourselves
We
have
Abraham
as
our
father
For
I
say
to
you
that
God
is
able
to
raise
up
children
for
Abraham
from
these
stones
9
Indeed
the
ax
is
already
lying
at
the
root
of
the
trees
Every
tree
then
that
does
not
produce
fine
fruit
will
be
cut
down
and
thrown
into
the
fire
10
And
the
crowds
were
asking
him
What
then
should
we
do
11
In
reply
he
said
to
them
Let
the
man
who
has
two
garments
share
with
the
man
who
has
none
and
let
the
one
who
has
something
to
eat
do
the
same
12
Even
tax
collectors
came
to
be
baptized
and
they
said
to
him
Teacher
what
should
we
do
13
He
said
to
them
Do
not
demand
anything
more
than
the
tax
rate
14
Also
those
in
military
service
were
asking
him
What
should
we
do
And
he
said
to
them
Do
not
harass
anybody
or
accuse
anybody
falsely
but
be
satisfied
with
your
provisions
15
Now
the
people
were
in
expectation
and
all
of
them
were
reasoning
in
their
hearts
about
John
May
he
perhaps
be
the
Christ
16
John
gave
the
answer
saying
to
all
I
for
my
part
baptize
you
with
water
but
the
one
stronger
than
I
am
is
coming
the
lace
of
whose
sandals
I
am
not
worthy
to
untie
He
will
baptize
you
with
holy
spirit
and
with
fire
17
His
winnowing
shovel
is
in
his
hand
to
clean
up
his
threshing
floor
completely
and
to
gather
the
wheat
into
his
storehouse
but
the
chaff
he
will
burn
up
with
fire
that
cannot
be
put
out
18
He
also
gave
many
other
exhortations
and
continued
declaring
good
news
to
the
people
19
But
Herod
the
district
ruler
because
of
being
reproved
by
John
concerning
Herodias
the
wife
of
his
brother
and
concerning
all
the
wicked
deeds
that
Herod
had
done
20
added
this
also
to
all
those
deeds
He
locked
John
up
in
prison
21
Now
when
all
the
people
were
baptized
Jesus
too
was
baptized
As
he
was
praying
the
heaven
was
opened
up
22
and
the
holy
spirit
in
bodily
form
like
a
dove
came
down
upon
him
and
a
voice
came
out
of
heaven
You
are
my
Son
the
beloved
I
have
approved
you
23
When
Jesus
began
his
work
he
was
about
30
years
old
being
the
son
as

opinion
was

Then

full

turned
away
from
the
Jordan
and
he
was
led
about
by
the
spirit
in
the
wilderness
2
for
40
days
being
tempted
by
the
Devil
And
he
ate
nothing
in
those
days
so
when
they
had
ended
he
felt
hungry
3
At
this
the
Devil
said
to
him
If
you
are
a
son
of
God
tell
this
stone
to
become
a
loaf
of
bread
4
But
Jesus
answered
him
It
is
written
Man
must
not
live
on
bread
alone
5
So
he
brought
him
up
and
showed
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
inhabited
earth
in
an
instant
of
time
6
Then
the
Devil
said
to
him
I
will
give
you
all
this
authority
and
their
glory
because
it
has
been
handed
over
to
me
and
I
give
it
to
whomever
I
wish
7
If
you
therefore
do
an
act
of
worship
before
me
it
will
all
be
yours
8
In
reply
Jesus
said
to
him
It
is
written
It
is
Jehovah
your
God
you
must
worship
and
it
is
to
him
alone
you
must
render
sacred
service
9
He
then
led
him
into
Jerusalem
and
stationed
him
on
the
battlement
of
the
temple
and
said
to
him
If
you
are
a
son
of
God
throw
yourself
down
from
here
10
for
it
is
written
He
will
give
his
angels
a
command
concerning
you
to
preserve
you

11
and
They
will
carry
you
on
their
hands
so
that
you
may
not
strike
your
foot
against
a
stone
12
In
answer
Jesus
said
to
him
It
is
said
You
must
not
put
Jehovah
your
God
to
the
test
13
So
the
Devil
having
finished
all
the
temptation
departed
from
him
until
another
convenient
time
14
Now
Jesus
returned
in
the
power
of
the
spirit
into
Galilee
And
good
reports
about
him
spread
throughout
all
the
surrounding
country
15
Also
he
began
to
teach
in
their
synagogues
and
he
was
held
in
honor
by
all
16
He
then
went
to
Nazareth
where
he
had
been
brought
up
and
according
to
his
custom
on
the
Sabbath
day
he
entered
the
synagogue
and
stood
up
to
read
17
So
the
scroll
of
the
prophet
Isaiah
was
handed
to
him
and
he
opened
the
scroll
and
found
the
place
where
it
was
written
18
Jehovahs
spirit
is
upon
me
because
he
anointed
me
to
declare
good
news
to
the
poor
He
sent
me
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captives
and
a
recovery
of
sight
to
the
blind
to
send
the
crushed
ones
away
free
19
to
preach
Jehovahs
acceptable
year
20
With
that
he
rolled
up
the
scroll
handed
it
back
to
the
attendant
and
sat
down
and
the
eyes
of
all
in
the
synagogue
were
intently
fixed
on
him
21
Then
he
began
to
say
to
them
Today
this
scripture
that
you
just
heard
is
fulfilled
22
And
they
all
began
to
give
favorable
witness
about
him
and
to
be
amazed
at
the
gracious
words
coming
out
of
his
mouth
and
they
were
saying
This
is
a
son
of
Joseph
is
it
not
23
At
this
he
said
to
them
No
doubt
you
will
apply
this
saying
to
me
Physician
cure
yourself
Do
also
here
in
your
home
territory
the
things
we
have
heard
were
done
in
Capernaum
24
So
he
said
Truly
I
tell
you
that
no
prophet
is
accepted
in
his
home
territory
25
For
instance
I
tell
you
in
truth
There
were
many
widows
in
Israel
in
the
days
of
Elijah
when
heaven
was
shut
up
for
three
years
and
six
months
and
a
great
famine
came
on
all
the
land
26
Yet
Elijah
was
sent
to
none
of
those
women
but
only
to
a
widow
in
Zarephath
in
the
land
of
Sidon
27
Also
there
were
many
lepers
in
Israel
in
the
time
of
Elisha
the
prophet
yet
not
one
of
them
was
cleansed
only
Naaman
the
Syrian
28
Now
all
those
hearing
these
things
in
the
synagogue
became
filled
with
anger
29
and
they
rose
up
and
rushed
him
outside
the
city
and
they
led
him
to
the
brow
of
the
mountain
on
which
their
city
had
been
built
in
order
to
throw
him
down
headlong
30
But
he
went
right
through
their
midst
and
continued
on
his
way
31
He
then
went
down
to
Capernaum
a
city
of
Galilee
And
he
was
teaching
them
on
the
Sabbath
32
and
they
were
astounded
at
his
way
of
teaching
because
he
spoke
with
authority
33
Now
in
the
synagogue
there
was
a
man
with
a
spirit
an
unclean
demon
and
he
shouted
with
a
loud
voice
34
Ah
What
have
we
to
do
with
you
Jesus
the
Nazarene
Did
you
come
to
destroy
us
I
know
exactly
who
you
are
the
Holy
One
of
God
35
But
Jesus
rebuked
it
saying
Be
silent
and
come
out
of
him
So
after
throwing
the
man
down
in
their
midst
the
demon
came
out
of
him
without
hurting
him
36
At
this
they
were
all
astonished
and
began
to
say
to
one
another
What
kind
of
speech
is
this
For
with
authority
and
power
he
orders
the
unclean
spirits
and
out
they
come
37
So
the
news
about
him
kept
spreading
into
every
corner
of
the
surrounding
country
38
After
leaving
the
synagogue
he
entered
into
Simons
home
Now
Simons
mother-in-law
was
suffering
with
a
high
fever
and
they
asked
him
to
help
her
39
So
he
stood
over
her
and
rebuked
the
fever
and
it
left
her
Instantly
she
got
up
and
began
ministering
to
them
40
But
when
the
sun
was
setting
all
those
who
had
people
sick
with
various
diseases
brought
them
to
him
By
laying
his
hands
on
each
one
of
them
he
cured
them
41
Demons
also
came
out
of
many
crying
out
and
saying
You
are
the
Son
of
God
But
rebuking
them
he
would
not
permit
them
to
speak
for
they
knew
him
to
be
the
Christ
42
However
at
daybreak
he
departed
and
went
to
an
isolated
place
But
the
crowds
began
searching
for
him
and
came
to
where
he
was
and
they
tried
to
keep
him
from
going
away
from
them
43
But
he
said
to
them
I
must
also
declare
the
good
news
of
the
Kingdom
of
God
to
other
cities
because
for
this
I
was
sent
44
So
he
went
on
preaching
in
the
synagogues
of
Judea
1
On
one
occasion
when
the
crowd
was
pressing
in
on
him
and
listening
to
the
word
of
God
he
was
standing
by
the
lake
of
Gennesaret
2
And
he
saw
two
boats
docked
at
the
lakeside
but
the
fishermen
had
got
out
of
them
and
were
washing
off
their
nets
3
Going
aboard
one
of
the
boats
which
was
Simons
he
asked
him
to
pull
away
a
bit
from
land
Then
he
sat
down
and
he
began
teaching
the
crowds
from
the
boat
4
When
he
stopped
speaking
he
said
to
Simon
Pull
out
to
where
it
is
deep
and
let
down
your
nets
for
a
catch
5
But
in
reply
Simon
said
Instructor
we
toiled
all
night
and
caught
nothing
but
at
your
word
I
will
lower
the
nets
6
Well
when
they
did
this
they
caught
a
great
number
of
fish
In
fact
their
nets
began
ripping
apart
7
So
they
motioned
to
their
partners
in
the
other
boat
to
come
and
assist
them
and
they
came
and
filled
both
boats
so
that
these
began
to
sink
8
Seeing
this
Simon
Peter
fell
down
at
the
knees
of
Jesus
saying
Depart
from
me
Lord
because
I
am
a
sinful
man
9
For
both
he
and
those
with
him
were
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
at
the
catch
of
fish
they
had
taken
10
and
the
same
was
true
of
both
James
and
John
Zebedees
sons
who
were
partners
with
Simon
But
Jesus
said
to
Simon
Stop
being
afraid
From
now
on
you
will
be
catching
men
alive
11
So
they
brought
the
boats
back
to
land
and
abandoned
everything
and
followed
him
12
On
another
occasion
while
he
was
in
one
of
the
cities
look
there
was
a
man
full
of
leprosy
When
he
caught
sight
of
Jesus
he
fell
facedown
and
begged
him
Lord
if
you
just
want
to
you
can
make
me
clean
13
So
stretching
out
his
hand
he
touched
him
saying
I
want
to
Be
made
clean
Immediately
the
leprosy
vanished
from
him
14
Then
he
gave
the
man
orders
to
tell
no
one
But
go
and
show
yourself
to
the
priest
and
make
an
offering
for
your
cleansing
just
as
Moses
directed
for
a
witness
to
them
15
But
the
news
about
him
just
kept
spreading
and
large
crowds
would
gather
together
to
listen
and
to
be
cured
of
their
sicknesses
16
However
he
often
went
into
the
desolate
areas
to
pray
17
On
one
of
those
days
while
he
was
teaching
Pharisees
and
teachers
of
the
Law
who
had
come
out
of
every
village
of
Galilee
and
Judea
and
from
Jerusalem
were
sitting
there
and
Jehovahs
power
was
with
him
to
do
healing
18
And
look
men
were
carrying
a
paralyzed
man
on
a
stretcher
and
they
were
trying
to
bring
him
in
and
place
him
before
Jesus
19
So
not
finding
a
way
to
bring
him
in
because
of
the
crowd
they
climbed
up
to
the
roof
and
they
lowered
him
on
the
stretcher
through
the
tiling
right
among
those
in
front
of
Jesus
20
When
he
saw
their
faith
he
said
Man
your
sins
are
forgiven
21
Then
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
started
to
reason
saying
Who
is
this
who
speaks
blasphemies
Who
can
forgive
sins
except
God
alone
22
But
Jesus
discerning
their
reasoning
said
in
answer
to
them
What
are
you
reasoning
in
your
hearts
23
Which
is
easier
to
say
Your
sins
are
forgiven

or
to
say
Get
up
and
walk
24
But
in
order
for
you
to
know
that
the
Son
of
man
has
authority
on
earth
to
forgive
sins—
he
said
to
the
paralyzed
man
I
say
to
you
Get
up
pick
up
your
stretcher
and
go
to
your
home
25
At
that
he
stood
up
before
them
picked
up
what
he
had
been
lying
on
and
went
to
his
home
glorifying
God
26
Then
one
and
all
were
seized
with
amazement
and
they
began
to
glorify
God
and
they
became
filled
with
awe
saying
We
have
seen
wonderful
things
today
27
Now
after
this
he
went
out
and
saw
a
tax
collector
named
Levi
sitting
at
the
tax
office
and
he
said
to
him
Be
my
follower
28
And
leaving
everything
behind
he
rose
up
and
began
to
follow
him
29
Then
Levi
spread
a
big
reception
feast
for
him
in
his
house
and
there
was
a
large
crowd
of
tax
collectors
and
others
who
were
dining
with
them
30
At
this
the
Pharisees
and
their
scribes
began
murmuring
to
his
disciples
saying
Why
do
you
eat
and
drink
with
tax
collectors
and
sinners
31
In
reply
Jesus
said
to
them
Those
who
are
healthy
do
not
need
a
physician
but
those
who
are
ill
do
32
I
have
come
to
call
not
righteous
people
but
sinners
to
repentance
33
They
said
to
him
Johns
disciples
fast
frequently
and
offer
supplications
and
so
do
those
of
the
Pharisees
but
yours
eat
and
drink
34
Jesus
said
to
them
You
cannot
make
the
friends
of
the
bridegroom
fast
while
the
bridegroom
is
with
them
can
you
35
But
days
will
come
when
the
bridegroom
will
indeed
be
taken
away
from
them
then
they
will
fast
in
those
days
36
He
also
gave
an
illustration
to
them
Nobody
cuts
a
patch
from
a
new
outer
garment
and
sews
it
on
an
old
garment
If
he
does
then
the
new
patch
tears
away
and
the
patch
from
the
new
garment
does
not
match
the
old
37
Also
no
one
puts
new
wine
into
old
wineskins
If
he
does
the
new
wine
will
burst
the
wineskins
and
it
will
be
spilled
out
and
the
wineskins
will
be
ruined
38
But
new
wine
must
be
put
into
new
wineskins
39
No
one
after
drinking
old
wine
wants
new
for
he
says
The
old
is
nice
1
Now
on
a
sabbath
he
was
passing
through
grainfields
and
his
disciples
were
plucking
and
eating
the
heads
of
grain
rubbing
them
with
their
hands
2
At
this
some
of
the
Pharisees
said
Why
are
you
doing
what
is
not
lawful
on
the
Sabbath
3
But
in
reply
Jesus
said
to
them
Have
you
never
read
what
David
did
when
he
and
the
men
with
him
were
hungry
4
How
he
entered
into
the
house
of
God
and
received
the
loaves
of
presentation
and
ate
and
gave
some
to
the
men
with
him
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
anyone
to
eat
but
for
the
priests
only
5
Then
he
said
to
them
The
Son
of
man
is
Lord
of
the
Sabbath
6
On
another
sabbath
he
entered
the
synagogue
and
began
teaching
And
a
man
was
there
whose
right
hand
was
withered
7
The
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
were
now
watching
Jesus
closely
to
see
whether
he
would
cure
on
the
Sabbath
in
order
to
find
some
way
to
accuse
him
8
He
however
knew
their
reasoning
so
he
said
to
the
man
with
the
withered
hand
Get
up
and
stand
in
the
center
And
he
rose
and
stood
there
9
Then
Jesus
said
to
them
I
ask
you
men
Is
it
lawful
on
the
Sabbath
to
do
good
or
to
do
harm
to
save
a
life
or
to
destroy
it
10
After
looking
around
at
them
all
he
said
to
the
man
Stretch
out
your
hand
He
did
so
and
his
hand
was
restored
11
But
they
flew
into
a
senseless
rage
and
they
began
to
talk
over
with
one
another
what
they
might
do
to
Jesus
12
On
one
of
those
days
he
went
out
to
the
mountain
to
pray
and
he
spent
the
whole
night
in
prayer
to
God
13
And
when
it
became
day
he
called
his
disciples
to
him
and
chose
from
among
them
12
whom
he
also
named
apostles
14
Simon
whom
he
also
named
Peter
Andrew
his
brother
James
John
Philip
Bartholomew
15
Matthew
Thomas
James
the
son
of
Alphaeus
Simon
who
is
called
the
zealous
one

16
Judas
the
son
of
James
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
turned
traitor
17
And
he
came
down
with
them
and
stood
on
a
level
place
and
there
was
a
large
crowd
of
his
disciples
and
a
great
multitude
of
people
from
all
Judea
and
Jerusalem
and
the
coastal
region
of
Tyre
and
Sidon
who
came
to
hear
him
and
to
be
healed
of
their
sicknesses
18
Even
those
troubled
with
unclean
spirits
were
cured
19
And
all
the
crowd
were
seeking
to
touch
him
because
power
was
going
out
of
him
and
healing
them
all
20
And
he
looked
up
at
his
disciples
and
began
to
say
Happy
are
you
who
are
poor
for
yours
is
the
Kingdom
of
God
21
Happy
are
you
who
hunger
now
for
you
will
be
filled
Happy
are
you
who
weep
now
for
you
will
laugh
22
Happy
are
you
whenever
men
hate
you
and
when
they
exclude
you
and
reproach
you
and
denounce
your
name
as
wicked
for
the
sake
of
the
Son
of
man
23
Rejoice
in
that
day
and
leap
for
joy
for
look
your
reward
is
great
in
heaven
for
those
are
the
same
things
their
forefathers
used
to
do
to
the
prophets
24
But
woe
to
you
who
are
rich
for
you
are
having
your
consolation
in
full
25
Woe
to
you
who
are
filled
up
now
for
you
will
go
hungry
Woe
you
who
are
laughing
now
for
you
will
mourn
and
weep
26
Woe
whenever
all
men
speak
well
of
you
for
this
is
what
their
forefathers
did
to
the
false
prophets
27
But
I
say
to
you
who
are
listening
Continue
to
love
your
enemies
to
do
good
to
those
hating
you
28
to
bless
those
cursing
you
to
pray
for
those
who
are
insulting
you
29
To
him
who
strikes
you
on
the
one
cheek
offer
the
other
also
and
from
him
who
takes
away
your
outer
garment
do
not
withhold
the
inner
garment
either
30
Give
to
everyone
asking
you
and
from
the
one
taking
your
things
away
do
not
ask
them
back
31
Also
just
as
you
want
men
to
do
to
you
do
the
same
way
to
them
32
If
you
love
those
loving
you
of
what
credit
is
it
to
you
For
even
the
sinners
love
those
loving
them
33
And
if
you
do
good
to
those
doing
good
to
you
of
what
credit
is
it
to
you
Even
the
sinners
do
the
same
34
Also
if
you
lend
to
those
from
whom
you
expect
repayment
of
what
credit
is
it
to
you
Even
sinners
lend
to
sinners
so
that
they
may
get
back
as
much
35
On
the
contrary
continue
to
love
your
enemies
and
to
do
good
and
to
lend
without
hoping
for
anything
back
and
your
reward
will
be
great
and
you
will
be
sons
of
the
Most
High
for
he
is
kind
toward
the
unthankful
and
wicked
36
Continue
being
merciful
just
as
your
Father
is
merciful
37
Moreover
stop
judging
and
you
will
by
no
means
be
judged
and
stop
condemning
and
you
will
by
no
means
be
condemned
Keep
on
forgiving
and
you
will
be
forgiven
38
Practice
giving
and
people
will
give
to
you
They
will
pour
into
your
laps
a
fine
measure
pressed
down
shaken
together
and
overflowing
For
with
the
measure
that
you
are
measuring
out
they
will
measure
out
to
you
in
return
39
Then
he
also
told
them
an
illustration
A
blind
man
cannot
guide
a
blind
man
can
he
Both
will
fall
into
a
pit
will
they
not
40
A
student
is
not
above
his
teacher
but
everyone
who
is
perfectly
instructed
will
be
like
his
teacher
41
Why
then
do
you
look
at
the
straw
in
your
brothers
eye
but
do
not
notice
the
rafter
in
your
own
eye
42
How
can
you
say
to
your
brother
Brother
allow
me
to
remove
the
straw
that
is
in
your
eye

while
you
yourself
do
not
see
the
rafter
in
your
own
eye
Hypocrite
First
remove
the
rafter
from
your
own
eye
and
then
you
will
see
clearly
how
to
remove
the
straw
that
is
in
your
brothers
eye
43
For
no
fine
tree
produces
rotten
fruit
and
no
rotten
tree
produces
fine
fruit
44
For
each
tree
is
known
by
its
own
fruit
For
example
people
do
not
gather
figs
from
thorns
nor
do
they
cut
grapes
off
a
thornbush
45
A
good
man
brings
good
out
of
the
good
treasure
of
his
heart
but
a
wicked
man
brings
what
is
wicked
out
of
his
wicked
treasure
for
out
of
the
hearts
abundance
his
mouth
speaks
46
Why
then
do
you
call
me
Lord
Lord
but
do
not
do
the
things
I
say
47
Everyone
who
comes
to
me
and
hears
my
words
and
does
them
I
will
show
you
whom
he
is
like
48
He
is
like
a
man
who
in
building
a
house
dug
and
went
down
deep
and
laid
a
foundation
on
the
rock
Consequently
when
a
flood
came
the
river
dashed
against
that
house
but
was
not
strong
enough
to
shake
it
for
it
was
well-built
49
On
the
other
hand
whoever
hears
and
does
nothing
is
like
a
man
who
built
a
house
on
the
ground
without
a
foundation
The
river
dashed
against
it
and
immediately
it
collapsed
and
the
ruin
of
that
house
was
great
1
When
he
had
completed
what
he
had
to
say
to
the
people
he
entered
Capernaum
2
Now
an
army
officers
slave
who
was
dear
to
him
was
seriously
ill
and
about
to
pass
away
3
When
he
heard
about
Jesus
he
sent
some
elders
of
the
Jews
to
him
to
ask
him
to
come
and
make
his
slave
well
4
They
came
up
to
Jesus
and
began
to
plead
with
him
earnestly
saying
He
is
worthy
of
your
granting
him
this
5
for
he
loves
our
nation
and
he
himself
built
our
synagogue
6
So
Jesus
went
with
them
But
when
he
was
not
far
from
the
house
the
army
officer
had
already
sent
friends
to
say
to
him
Sir
do
not
bother
for
I
am
not
worthy
to
have
you
come
under
my
roof
7
That
is
why
I
did
not
consider
myself
worthy
to
come
to
you
But
say
the
word
and
let
my
servant
be
healed
8
For
I
too
am
a
man
placed
under
authority
having
soldiers
under
me
and
I
say
to
this
one
Go
and
he
goes
and
to
another
Come
and
he
comes
and
to
my
slave
Do
this
and
he
does
it
9
When
Jesus
heard
these
things
he
was
amazed
at
him
and
he
turned
to
the
crowd
following
him
and
said
I
tell
you
not
even
in
Israel
have
I
found
so
great
a
faith
10
And
when
those
who
had
been
sent
returned
to
the
house
they
found
the
slave
in
good
health
11
Soon
afterward
he
traveled
to
a
city
called
Nain
and
his
disciples
and
a
large
crowd
were
traveling
with
him
12
As
he
got
near
the
gate
of
the
city
why
look
there
was
a
dead
man
being
carried
out
the
only
son
of
his
mother
Besides
she
was
a
widow
A
considerable
crowd
from
the
city
was
also
with
her
13
When
the
Lord
caught
sight
of
her
he
was
moved
with
pity
for
her
and
he
said
to
her
Stop
weeping
14
With
that
he
approached
and
touched
the
bier
and
the
bearers
stood
still
Then
he
said
Young
man
I
say
to
you
get
up
15
And
the
dead
man
sat
up
and
started
to
speak
and
Jesus
gave
him
to
his
mother
16
Now
fear
seized
them
all
and
they
began
to
glorify
God
saying
A
great
prophet
has
been
raised
up
among
us

and
God
has
turned
his
attention
to
his
people
17
And
this
news
concerning
him
spread
out
into
all
Judea
and
all
the
surrounding
country
18
Now
Johns
disciples
reported
to
him
all
these
things
19
So
John
summoned
two
of
his
disciples
and
sent
them
to
the
Lord
to
ask
Are
you
the
Coming
One
or
are
we
to
expect
a
different
one
20
When
they
came
to
him
the
men
said
John
the
Baptist
sent
us
to
you
to
ask
Are
you
the
Coming
One
or
are
we
to
expect
another
21
In
that
hour
he
cured
many
people
of
sicknesses
serious
diseases
and
wicked
spirits
and
he
granted
many
blind
people
the
gift
of
sight
22
In
reply
he
said
to
them
Go
and
report
to
John
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
The
blind
are
now
seeing
the
lame
are
walking
the
lepers
are
being
cleansed
the
deaf
are
hearing
the
dead
are
being
raised
up
and
the
poor
are
being
told
the
good
news
23
Happy
is
the
one
who
finds
no
cause
for
stumbling
in
me
24
When
the
messengers
of
John
had
gone
away
Jesus
began
to
speak
to
the
crowds
about
John
What
did
you
go
out
into
the
wilderness
to
see
A
reed
being
tossed
by
the
wind
25
What
then
did
you
go
out
to
see
A
man
dressed
in
soft
garments
Why
those
wearing
splendid
dress
and
living
in
luxury
are
in
royal
houses
26
Really
then
what
did
you
go
out
to
see
A
prophet
Yes
I
tell
you
and
far
more
than
a
prophet
27
This
is
the
one
about
whom
it
is
written
Look
I
am
sending
my
messenger
ahead
of
you
who
will
prepare
your
way
ahead
of
you
28
I
tell
you
among
those
born
of
women
there
is
no
one
greater
than
John
but
a
lesser
person
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
is
greater
than
he
is
29
When
all
the
people
and
the
tax
collectors
heard
this
they
declared
God
to
be
righteous
for
they
had
been
baptized
with
the
baptism
of
John
30
But
the
Pharisees
and
those
versed
in
the
Law
disregarded
the
counsel
of
God
to
them
since
they
had
not
been
baptized
by
him
31
With
whom
therefore
should
I
compare
the
men
of
this
generation
and
whom
are
they
like
32
They
are
like
young
children
sitting
in
a
marketplace
and
calling
out
to
one
another
saying
We
played
the
flute
for
you
but
you
did
not
dance
we
wailed
but
you
did
not
weep
33
Likewise
John
the
Baptist
has
come
neither
eating
bread
nor
drinking
wine
but
you
say
He
has
a
demon
34
The
Son
of
man
has
come
eating
and
drinking
but
you
say
Look
A
man
who
is
a
glutton
and
is
given
to
drinking
wine
a
friend
of
tax
collectors
and
sinners
35
All
the
same
wisdom
is
proved
righteous
by
all
its
children
36
Now
one
of
the
Pharisees
kept
asking
him
to
dine
with
him
So
he
entered
the
house
of
the
Pharisee
and
reclined
at
the
table
37
And
look
a
woman
who
was
known
in
the
city
to
be
a
sinner
learned
that
he
was
dining
in
the
house
of
the
Pharisee
and
she
brought
an
alabaster
jar
of
perfumed
oil
38
Taking
a
position
behind
him
at
his
feet
she
wept
and
began
to
wet
his
feet
with
her
tears
and
she
wiped
them
off
with
the
hair
of
her
head
Also
she
tenderly
kissed
his
feet
and
poured
the
perfumed
oil
on
them
39
Seeing
this
the
Pharisee
who
had
invited
him
said
to
himself
If
this
man
were
really
a
prophet
he
would
know
who
and
what
kind
of
woman
it
is
who
is
touching
him
that
she
is
a
sinner
40
But
in
reply
Jesus
said
to
him
Simon
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
He
said
Teacher
say
it
41
Two
men
were
debtors
to
a
certain
lender
the
one
was
in
debt
for
500
denarii
but
the
other
for
50
42
When
they
did
not
have
anything
to
pay
him
back
with
he
freely
forgave
them
both
Therefore
which
one
of
them
will
love
him
more
43
In
answer
Simon
said
I
suppose
it
is
the
one
whom
he
forgave
more
He
said
to
him
You
judged
correctly
44
With
that
he
turned
to
the
woman
and
said
to
Simon
Do
you
see
this
woman
I
entered
your
house
you
gave
me
no
water
for
my
feet
But
this
woman
wet
my
feet
with
her
tears
and
wiped
them
off
with
her
hair
45
You
gave
me
no
kiss
but
this
woman
from
the
hour
that
I
came
in
did
not
stop
tenderly
kissing
my
feet
46
You
did
not
pour
oil
on
my
head
but
this
woman
poured
perfumed
oil
on
my
feet
47
Because
of
this
I
tell
you
her
sins
many
though
they
are
are
forgiven
because
she
loved
much
But
the
one
who
is
forgiven
little
loves
little
48
Then
he
said
to
her
Your
sins
are
forgiven
49
Those
reclining
at
the
table
with
him
started
to
say
among
themselves
Who
is
this
man
who
even
forgives
sins
50
But
he
said
to
the
woman
Your
faith
has
saved
you
go
in
peace
1
Shortly
afterward
he
traveled
from
city
to
city
and
from
village
to
village
preaching
and
declaring
the
good
news
of
the
Kingdom
of
God
And
the
Twelve
were
with
him
2
as
were
certain
women
who
had
been
cured
of
wicked
spirits
and
sicknesses
Mary
who
was
called
Magdalene
from
whom
seven
demons
had
come
out
3
Joanna
the
wife
of
Chuza
Herods
man
in
charge
Susanna
and
many
other
women
who
were
ministering
to
them
from
their
belongings
4
Now
when
a
large
crowd
had
gathered
together
with
those
who
went
to
him
from
city
to
city
he
spoke
by
means
of
an
illustration
5
A
sower
went
out
to
sow
his
seed
As
he
was
sowing
some
of
them
fell
alongside
the
road
and
were
trampled
on
and
the
birds
of
heaven
ate
them
up
6
Some
landed
on
the
rock
and
after
sprouting
they
dried
up
because
they
had
no
moisture
7
Others
fell
among
the
thorns
and
the
thorns
that
grew
up
with
them
choked
them
8
But
others
fell
on
the
good
soil
and
after
sprouting
they
produced
100
times
more
fruit
As
he
said
these
things
he
called
out
Let
the
one
who
has
ears
to
listen
listen
9
But
his
disciples
asked
him
what
this
illustration
meant
10
He
said
To
you
it
is
granted
to
understand
the
sacred
secrets
of
the
Kingdom
of
God
but
for
the
rest
it
is
in
illustrations
so
that
though
looking
they
may
look
in
vain
and
though
hearing
they
may
not
get
the
sense
11
Now
the
illustration
means
this
The
seed
is
the
word
of
God
12
Those
alongside
the
road
are
the
ones
who
have
heard
and
then
the
Devil
comes
and
takes
the
word
away
from
their
hearts
so
that
they
may
not
believe
and
be
saved
13
Those
on
the
rock
are
the
ones
who
when
they
hear
the
word
receive
it
with
joy
but
these
have
no
root
They
believe
for
a
while
but
in
a
season
of
testing
they
fall
away
14
As
for
that
which
fell
among
the
thorns
these
are
the
ones
who
have
heard
but
by
being
carried
away
by
anxieties
riches
and
pleasures
of
this
life
they
are
completely
choked
and
bring
nothing
to
maturity
15
As
for
that
on
the
fine
soil
these
are
the
ones
who
after
hearing
the
word
with
a
fine
and
good
heart
retain
it
and
bear
fruit
with
endurance
16
No
one
after
lighting
a
lamp
covers
it
with
a
vessel
or
puts
it
underneath
a
bed
but
he
puts
it
on
a
lampstand
so
that
those
who
come
in
may
see
the
light
17
For
there
is
nothing
hidden
that
will
not
become
manifest
nor
anything
carefully
concealed
that
will
never
become
known
and
not
come
out
in
the
open
18
Therefore
pay
attention
to
how
you
listen
for
whoever
has
will
be
given
more
but
whoever
does
not
have
even
what
he
imagines
he
has
will
be
taken
away
from
him
19
Now
his
mother
and
brothers
came
to
him
but
they
were
unable
to
get
near
him
because
of
the
crowd
20
So
it
was
reported
to
him
Your
mother
and
your
brothers
are
standing
outside
wanting
to
see
you
21
In
reply
he
said
to
them
My
mother
and
my
brothers
are
these
who
hear
the
word
of
God
and
do
it
22
One
day
he
and
his
disciples
got
into
a
boat
and
he
said
to
them
Let
us
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
lake
So
they
set
sail
23
But
as
they
were
sailing
along
he
fell
asleep
And
a
violent
windstorm
descended
on
the
lake
and
their
boat
began
to
fill
up
with
water
and
to
be
in
danger
24
So
they
went
and
woke
him
up
saying
Instructor
Instructor
we
are
about
to
perish
With
that
he
got
up
and
rebuked
the
wind
and
the
raging
of
the
water
and
they
subsided
and
a
calm
set
in
25
Then
he
said
to
them
Where
is
your
faith
But
they
were
filled
with
fear
and
were
astounded
saying
to
one
another
Who
really
is
this
For
he
orders
even
the
winds
and
the
water
and
they
obey
him
26
And
they
put
in
to
shore
in
the
region
of
the
Gerasenes
which
is
on
the
side
opposite
Galilee
27
As
Jesus
got
out
onto
land
a
demon-possessed
man
from
the
city
met
him
For
a
considerable
time
he
had
not
worn
clothing
and
he
was
staying
not
in
a
house
but
among
the
tombs
28
At
the
sight
of
Jesus
he
cried
out
and
fell
down
before
him
and
with
a
loud
voice
he
said
What
have
I
to
do
with
you
Jesus
Son
of
the
Most
High
God
I
beg
you
do
not
torment
me
29
For
Jesus
had
been
ordering
the
unclean
spirit
to
come
out
of
the
man
It
had
seized
him
on
many
occasions
and
he
was
repeatedly
bound
with
chains
and
fetters
and
kept
under
guard
but
he
would
break
the
bonds
and
be
driven
by
the
demon
into
the
isolated
places
30
Jesus
asked
him
What
is
your
name
He
said
Legion

for
many
demons
had
entered
into
him
31
And
they
kept
pleading
with
him
not
to
order
them
to
go
away
into
the
abyss
32
Now
a
large
herd
of
swine
was
feeding
there
on
the
mountain
so
they
pleaded
with
him
to
permit
them
to
enter
into
the
swine
and
he
gave
them
permission
33
With
that
the
demons
came
out
of
the
man
and
went
into
the
swine
and
the
herd
rushed
over
the
precipice
into
the
lake
and
drowned
34
But
when
the
herders
saw
what
had
happened
they
fled
and
reported
it
in
the
city
and
in
the
countryside
35
Then
people
went
out
to
see
what
had
happened
They
came
to
Jesus
and
found
the
man
from
whom
the
demons
had
come
out
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
sitting
at
the
feet
of
Jesus
and
they
grew
fearful
36
Those
who
had
seen
it
reported
to
them
how
the
demon-possessed
man
had
been
made
well
37
Then
a
great
number
from
the
surrounding
region
of
the
Gerasenes
asked
Jesus
to
go
away
from
them
because
they
were
gripped
by
great
fear
Then
he
went
aboard
the
boat
to
depart
38
However
the
man
from
whom
the
demons
had
gone
out
kept
begging
to
continue
with
him
but
he
sent
the
man
away
saying
39
Go
back
home
and
keep
on
relating
what
God
did
for
you
So
he
went
away
proclaiming
throughout
the
whole
city
what
Jesus
had
done
for
him
40
When
Jesus
returned
the
crowd
received
him
kindly
for
they
were
all
expecting
him
41
But
look
a
man
named
Jairus
came
this
man
was
a
presiding
officer
of
the
synagogue
And
he
fell
at
the
feet
of
Jesus
and
began
to
plead
with
him
to
come
to
his
house
42
because
his
only
daughter
who
was
about
12
years
old
was
dying
As
Jesus
was
going
the
crowds
pressed
in
on
him
43
Now
there
was
a
woman
who
had
a
flow
of
blood
for
12
years
and
she
had
not
been
able
to
get
a
cure
from
anyone
44
She
approached
from
behind
and
touched
the
fringe
of
his
outer
garment
and
immediately
her
flow
of
blood
stopped
45
So
Jesus
said
Who
touched
me
When
they
were
all
denying
it
Peter
said
Instructor
the
crowds
are
hemming
you
in
and
pressing
against
you
46
But
Jesus
said
Someone
touched
me
for
I
know
that
power
went
out
of
me
47
Seeing
that
she
had
not
escaped
notice
the
woman
came
trembling
and
fell
down
before
him
and
declared
before
all
the
people
why
she
touched
him
and
how
she
was
healed
immediately
48
But
he
said
to
her
Daughter
your
faith
has
made
you
well
Go
in
peace
49
While
he
was
yet
speaking
a
representative
of
the
presiding
officer
of
the
synagogue
came
saying
Your
daughter
has
died
do
not
bother
the
Teacher
any
longer
50
On
hearing
this
Jesus
answered
him
Have
no
fear
only
have
faith
and
she
will
be
saved
51
When
he
reached
the
house
he
did
not
let
anyone
go
in
with
him
except
Peter
John
James
and
the
girls
father
and
mother
52
But
people
were
all
weeping
and
beating
themselves
in
grief
for
her
So
he
said
Stop
weeping
for
she
did
not
die
but
is
sleeping
53
At
this
they
began
to
laugh
at
him
scornfully
because
they
knew
she
had
died
54
But
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
called
to
her
Child
get
up
55
And
her
spirit
returned
and
she
rose
immediately
and
he
ordered
that
something
be
given
her
to
eat
56
Well
her
parents
were
beside
themselves
but
he
instructed
them
to
tell
no
one
what
had
happened
1
Then
he
called
the
Twelve
together
and
gave
them
power
and
authority
over
all
the
demons
and
to
cure
diseases
2
And
he
sent
them
out
to
preach
the
Kingdom
of
God
and
to
heal
3
and
he
said
to
them
Carry
nothing
for
the
trip
neither
staff
nor
food
pouch
nor
bread
nor
money
neither
have
two
garments
4
But
wherever
you
enter
into
a
home
stay
there
and
leave
from
there
5
And
wherever
people
do
not
receive
you
on
going
out
of
that
city
shake
the
dust
off
your
feet
for
a
witness
against
them
6
Then
starting
out
they
went
through
the
territory
from
village
to
village
declaring
the
good
news
and
performing
cures
everywhere
7
Now
Herod
the
district
ruler
heard
about
everything
that
was
happening
and
he
was
greatly
perplexed
because
some
were
saying
that
John
had
been
raised
up
from
the
dead
8
but
others
were
saying
that
Elijah
had
appeared
and
still
others
that
one
of
the
ancient
prophets
had
risen
9
Herod
said
John
I
beheaded
Who
then
is
this
about
whom
I
am
hearing
such
things
So
he
was
trying
to
see
him
10
When
the
apostles
returned
they
reported
to
Jesus
all
they
had
done
With
that
he
took
them
along
and
withdrew
privately
into
a
city
called
Bethsaida
11
But
the
crowds
getting
to
know
it
followed
him
And
he
received
them
kindly
and
began
to
speak
to
them
about
the
Kingdom
of
God
and
he
healed
those
needing
a
cure
12
Then
the
day
was
coming
to
a
close
The
Twelve
now
came
up
and
said
to
him
Send
the
crowd
away
so
that
they
may
go
into
the
surrounding
villages
and
countryside
to
find
lodging
and
provisions
because
out
here
we
are
in
an
isolated
place
13
But
he
said
to
them
You
give
them
something
to
eat
They
said
We
have
nothing
more
than
five
loaves
and
two
fish
unless
perhaps
we
ourselves
go
and
buy
food
for
all
these
people
14
There
were
in
fact
about
5000
men
But
he
said
to
his
disciples
Have
them
sit
down
in
groups
of
about
50
each
15
And
they
did
so
and
had
them
all
sit
down
16
Taking
now
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish
he
looked
up
to
heaven
and
blessed
them
Then
he
broke
them
up
and
began
giving
them
to
the
disciples
to
set
before
the
crowd
17
So
they
all
ate
and
were
satisfied
and
they
took
up
the
leftovers
12
baskets
of
fragments
18
Later
while
he
was
praying
alone
the
disciples
came
to
him
and
he
questioned
them
saying
Who
are
the
crowds
saying
that
I
am
19
In
reply
they
said
John
the
Baptist
but
others
say
Elijah
and
still
others
say
that
one
of
the
ancient
prophets
has
risen
20
Then
he
said
to
them
You
though
who
do
you
say
I
am
Peter
answered
The
Christ
of
God
21
Then
in
a
stern
talk
to
them
he
instructed
them
not
to
tell
this
to
anybody
22
but
he
said
The
Son
of
man
must
undergo
many
sufferings
and
be
rejected
by
the
elders
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
be
killed
and
on
the
third
day
be
raised
up
23
Then
he
went
on
to
say
to
all
If
anyone
wants
to
come
after
me
let
him
disown
himself
and
pick
up
his
torture
stake
day
after
day
and
keep
following
me
24
For
whoever
wants
to
save
his
life
will
lose
it
but
whoever
loses
his
life
for
my
sake
is
the
one
who
will
save
it
25
Really
what
good
will
it
do
a
man
if
he
gains
the
whole
world
but
loses
his
own
self
or
suffers
ruin
26
For
whoever
becomes
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
words
the
Son
of
man
will
be
ashamed
of
that
person
when
he
comes
in
his
glory
and
that
of
the
Father
and
of
the
holy
angels
27
But
I
tell
you
truly
there
are
some
of
those
standing
here
who
will
not
taste
death
at
all
until
first
they
see
the
Kingdom
of
God
28
In
fact
about
eight
days
after
saying
these
words
he
took
Peter
John
and
James
along
and
climbed
up
the
mountain
to
pray
29
And
as
he
was
praying
the
appearance
of
his
face
changed
and
his
clothing
became
glitteringly
white
30
And
look
two
men
were
conversing
with
him
they
were
Moses
and
Elijah
31
These
appeared
with
glory
and
began
talking
about
his
departure
which
he
was
about
to
fulfill
at
Jerusalem
32
Now
Peter
and
those
with
him
were
weighed
down
with
sleep
but
when
they
became
fully
awake
they
saw
his
glory
and
the
two
men
standing
with
him
33
And
as
these
were
departing
from
him
Peter
said
to
Jesus
Instructor
it
is
fine
for
us
to
be
here
So
let
us
erect
three
tents
one
for
you
one
for
Moses
and
one
for
Elijah
He
did
not
realize
what
he
was
saying
34
But
as
he
was
saying
these
things
a
cloud
formed
and
began
to
overshadow
them
As
they
entered
into
the
cloud
they
became
afraid
35
Then
a
voice
came
out
of
the
cloud
saying
This
is
my
Son
the
one
who
has
been
chosen
Listen
to
him
36
As
the
voice
spoke
Jesus
was
found
alone
But
they
kept
quiet
and
did
not
report
to
anyone
in
those
days
any
of
the
things
they
saw
37
The
following
day
when
they
came
down
from
the
mountain
a
large
crowd
met
him
38
And
look
a
man
called
out
from
the
crowd
saying
Teacher
I
beg
you
to
take
a
look
at
my
son
because
he
is
my
only
one
39
And
look
a
spirit
seizes
him
and
suddenly
he
cries
out
and
it
throws
him
into
convulsions
with
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
only
with
difficulty
does
it
leave
him
after
bruising
him
40
I
begged
your
disciples
to
expel
it
but
they
could
not
41
In
response
Jesus
said
O
faithless
and
twisted
generation
how
long
must
I
continue
with
you
and
put
up
with
you
Bring
your
son
over
here
42
But
even
as
he
was
approaching
the
demon
hurled
him
to
the
ground
and
violently
threw
him
into
a
convulsion
However
Jesus
rebuked
the
unclean
spirit
and
healed
the
boy
and
gave
him
back
to
his
father
43
And
they
were
all
astounded
at
the
majestic
power
of
God
While
they
were
all
astonished
at
all
the
things
he
was
doing
he
said
to
his
disciples
44
Listen
carefully
and
remember
these
words
for
the
Son
of
man
is
going
to
be
betrayed
into
mens
hands
45
But
they
did
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
In
fact
it
was
concealed
from
them
so
that
they
might
not
grasp
it
and
they
were
afraid
to
question
him
about
this
saying
46
Then
a
dispute
arose
among
them
about
which
one
of
them
was
the
greatest
47
Jesus
knowing
the
reasoning
of
their
hearts
took
a
young
child
stood
him
beside
him
48
and
said
to
them
Whoever
receives
this
young
child
on
the
basis
of
my
name
receives
me
also
and
whoever
receives
me
also
receives
the
One
who
sent
me
For
the
one
who
conducts
himself
as
a
lesser
one
among
all
of
you
is
the
one
who
is
great
49
In
response
John
said
Instructor
we
saw
someone
expelling
demons
by
using
your
name
and
we
tried
to
prevent
him
because
he
is
not
following
with
us
50
But
Jesus
said
to
him
Do
not
try
to
prevent
him
for
whoever
is
not
against
you
is
for
you
51
As
the
days
were
drawing
near
for
him
to
be
taken
up
he
resolutely
set
his
face
to
go
to
Jerusalem
52
So
he
sent
messengers
ahead
of
him
And
they
went
and
entered
a
village
of
Samaritans
to
make
preparations
for
him
53
But
they
did
not
receive
him
because
he
was
determined
to
go
to
Jerusalem
54
When
the
disciples
James
and
John
saw
this
they
said
Lord
do
you
want
us
to
call
fire
down
from
heaven
and
annihilate
them
55
But
he
turned
and
rebuked
them
56
So
they
went
to
a
different
village
57
Now
as
they
were
going
along
the
road
someone
said
to
him
I
will
follow
you
wherever
you
go
58
But
Jesus
said
to
him
Foxes
have
dens
and
birds
of
heaven
have
nests
but
the
Son
of
man
has
nowhere
to
lay
down
his
head
59
Then
he
said
to
another
Be
my
follower
The
man
said
Lord
permit
me
first
to
go
and
bury
my
father
60
But
he
said
to
him
Let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
but
you
go
and
declare
abroad
the
Kingdom
of
God
61
And
still
another
said
I
will
follow
you
Lord
but
first
permit
me
to
say
good-bye
to
those
in
my
household
62
Jesus
said
to
him
No
man
who
has
put
his
hand
to
a
plow
and
looks
at
the
things
behind
is
well-suited
for
the
Kingdom
of
God
1
After
these
things
the
Lord
designated
70
others
and
sent
them
out
by
twos
ahead
of
him
into
every
city
and
place
where
he
himself
was
to
go
2
Then
he
said
to
them
Yes
the
harvest
is
great
but
the
workers
are
few
Therefore
beg
the
Master
of
the
harvest
to
send
out
workers
into
his
harvest
3
Go
Look
I
am
sending
you
out
as
lambs
in
among
wolves
4
Do
not
carry
a
money
bag
or
a
food
pouch
or
sandals
and
do
not
greet
anyone
along
the
road
5
Wherever
you
enter
into
a
house
say
first
May
this
house
have
peace
6
And
if
a
friend
of
peace
is
there
your
peace
will
rest
upon
him
But
if
there
is
not
it
will
return
to
you
7
So
stay
in
that
house
eating
and
drinking
the
things
they
provide
for
the
worker
is
worthy
of
his
wages
Do
not
keep
transferring
from
house
to
house
8
Also
wherever
you
enter
into
a
city
and
they
receive
you
eat
what
is
set
before
you
9
and
cure
the
sick
ones
in
it
and
tell
them
The
Kingdom
of
God
has
come
near
to
you
10
But
wherever
you
enter
into
a
city
and
they
do
not
receive
you
go
out
into
its
main
streets
and
say
11
We
wipe
off
against
you
even
the
dust
that
sticks
to
our
feet
from
your
city
Nevertheless
know
this
that
the
Kingdom
of
God
has
come
near
12
I
tell
you
that
it
will
be
more
endurable
for
Sodom
in
that
day
than
for
that
city
13
Woe
to
you
Chorazin
Woe
to
you
Bethsaida
because
if
the
powerful
works
that
have
taken
place
in
you
had
taken
place
in
Tyre
and
Sidon
they
would
long
ago
have
repented
sitting
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
14
Consequently
it
will
be
more
endurable
for
Tyre
and
Sidon
in
the
judgment
than
for
you
15
And
you
Capernaum
will
you
perhaps
be
exalted
to
heaven
Down
to
the
Grave
you
will
come
16
Whoever
listens
to
you
listens
to
me
And
whoever
disregards
you
disregards
me
also
Moreover
whoever
disregards
me
disregards
also
Him
who
sent
me
17
Then
the
70
returned
with
joy
saying
Lord
even
the
demons
are
made
subject
to
us
by
the
use
of
your
name
18
At
that
he
said
to
them
I
see
Satan
already
fallen
like
lightning
from
heaven
19
Look
I
have
given
you
the
authority
to
trample
underfoot
serpents
and
scorpions
and
over
all
the
power
of
the
enemy
and
nothing
at
all
will
harm
you
20
Nevertheless
do
not
rejoice
because
the
spirits
are
made
subject
to
you
but
rejoice
because
your
names
have
been
written
in
the
heavens
21
In
that
very
hour
he
became
overjoyed
in
the
holy
spirit
and
said
I
publicly
praise
you
Father
Lord
of
heaven
and
earth
because
you
have
carefully
hidden
these
things
from
wise
and
intellectual
ones
and
have
revealed
them
to
young
children
Yes
O
Father
because
this
is
the
way
you
approved
22
All
things
have
been
handed
over
to
me
by
my
Father
and
no
one
knows
who
the
Son
is
except
the
Father
and
no
one
knows
who
the
Father
is
except
the
Son
and
anyone
to
whom
the
Son
is
willing
to
reveal
him
23
With
that
he
turned
to
the
disciples
and
told
them
privately
Happy
are
the
eyes
that
see
the
things
you
are
seeing
24
For
I
say
to
you
many
prophets
and
kings
desired
to
see
the
things
you
are
observing
but
did
not
see
them
and
to
hear
the
things
you
are
hearing
but
did
not
hear
them
25
Now
look
a
man
versed
in
the
Law
stood
up
to
test
him
and
said
Teacher
what
do
I
need
to
do
to
inherit
everlasting
life
26
He
said
to
him
What
is
written
in
the
Law
How
do
you
read
27
In
answer
he
said
You
must
love
Jehovah
your
God
with
your
whole
heart
and
with
your
whole
soul
and
with
your
whole
strength
and
with
your
whole
mind
and
your
neighbor
as
yourself
28
He
said
to
him
You
answered
correctly
keep
doing
this
and
you
will
get
life
29
But
wanting
to
prove
himself
righteous
the
man
said
to
Jesus
Who
really
is
my
neighbor
30
In
reply
Jesus
said
A
man
was
going
down
from
Jerusalem
to
Jericho
and
fell
victim
to
robbers
who
stripped
him
beat
him
and
went
off
leaving
him
half-dead
31
Now
by
coincidence
a
priest
was
going
down
on
that
road
but
when
he
saw
him
he
passed
by
on
the
opposite
side
32
Likewise
a
Levite
when
he
came
to
the
place
and
saw
him
passed
by
on
the
opposite
side
33
But
a
certain
Samaritan
traveling
the
road
came
upon
him
and
at
seeing
him
he
was
moved
with
pity
34
So
he
approached
him
and
bandaged
his
wounds
pouring
oil
and
wine
on
them
Then
he
mounted
him
on
his
own
animal
and
brought
him
to
an
inn
and
took
care
of
him
35
The
next
day
he
took
out
two
denarii
gave
them
to
the
innkeeper
and
said
Take
care
of
him
and
whatever
you
spend
besides
this
I
will
repay
you
when
I
return
36
Who
of
these
three
seems
to
you
to
have
made
himself
neighbor
to
the
man
who
fell
victim
to
the
robbers
37
He
said
The
one
who
acted
mercifully
toward
him
Jesus
then
said
to
him
Go
and
do
the
same
yourself
38
Now
as
they
went
on
their
way
he
entered
into
a
certain
village
Here
a
woman
named
Martha
received
him
as
a
guest
in
her
house
39
She
also
had
a
sister
called
Mary
who
sat
down
at
the
feet
of
the
Lord
and
kept
listening
to
what
he
was
saying
40
Martha
on
the
other
hand
was
distracted
with
attending
to
many
duties
So
she
came
to
him
and
said
Lord
does
it
not
matter
to
you
that
my
sister
has
left
me
alone
to
attend
to
things
Tell
her
to
come
and
help
me
41
In
answer
the
Lord
said
to
her
Martha
Martha
you
are
anxious
and
disturbed
about
many
things
42
A
few
things
though
are
needed
or
just
one
For
her
part
Mary
chose
the
good
portion
and
it
will
not
be
taken
away
from
her
1
Now
he
was
in
a
certain
place
praying
and
when
he
stopped
one
of
his
disciples
said
to
him
Lord
teach
us
how
to
pray
just
as
John
also
taught
his
disciples
2
So
he
said
to
them
Whenever
you
pray
say
Father
let
your
name
be
sanctified
Let
your
Kingdom
come
3
Give
us
each
day
our
bread
according
to
our
daily
needs
4
And
forgive
us
our
sins
for
we
ourselves
also
forgive
everyone
who
is
in
debt
to
us
and
do
not
bring
us
into
temptation
5
Then
he
said
to
them
Suppose
one
of
you
has
a
friend
and
you
go
to
him
at
midnight
and
say
to
him
Friend
lend
me
three
loaves
6
because
one
of
my
friends
has
just
come
to
me
on
a
journey
and
I
have
nothing
to
offer
him
7
But
that
one
replies
from
inside
Stop
bothering
me
The
door
is
already
locked
and
my
young
children
are
with
me
in
bed
I
cannot
get
up
and
give
you
anything
8
I
tell
you
even
if
he
will
not
get
up
and
give
him
anything
because
of
being
his
friend
certainly
because
of
his
bold
persistence
he
will
get
up
and
give
him
whatever
he
needs
9
So
I
say
to
you
keep
on
asking
and
it
will
be
given
you
keep
on
seeking
and
you
will
find
keep
on
knocking
and
it
will
be
opened
to
you
10
For
everyone
asking
receives
and
everyone
seeking
finds
and
to
everyone
knocking
it
will
be
opened
11
Indeed
which
father
among
you
if
his
son
asks
for
a
fish
will
hand
him
a
serpent
instead
of
a
fish
12
Or
if
he
also
asks
for
an
egg
will
hand
him
a
scorpion
13
Therefore
if
you
although
being
wicked
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
to
your
children
how
much
more
so
will
the
Father
in
heaven
give
holy
spirit
to
those
asking
him
14
Later
he
expelled
a
speechless
demon
After
the
demon
came
out
the
speechless
man
spoke
and
the
crowds
were
amazed
15
But
some
of
them
said
He
expels
the
demons
by
means
of
Beelzebub
the
ruler
of
the
demons
16
And
others
to
test
him
began
demanding
a
sign
out
of
heaven
from
him
17
Knowing
their
thinking
he
said
to
them
Every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
comes
to
ruin
and
a
house
divided
against
itself
falls
18
In
the
same
way
if
Satan
is
also
divided
against
himself
how
will
his
kingdom
stand
For
you
say
I
expel
the
demons
by
means
of
Beelzebub
19
If
I
expel
the
demons
by
means
of
Beelzebub
by
whom
do
your
sons
expel
them
This
is
why
they
will
be
your
judges
20
But
if
it
is
by
means
of
Gods
finger
that
I
expel
the
demons
the
Kingdom
of
God
has
really
overtaken
you
21
When
a
strong
well-armed
man
guards
his
palace
his
belongings
remain
secure
22
But
when
someone
stronger
than
he
is
comes
against
him
and
conquers
him
that
man
takes
away
all
his
weapons
in
which
he
was
trusting
and
he
divides
up
the
things
he
took
from
him
23
Whoever
is
not
on
my
side
is
against
me
and
whoever
does
not
gather
with
me
scatters
24
When
an
unclean
spirit
comes
out
of
a
man
it
passes
through
waterless
places
in
search
of
a
resting-place
and
after
finding
none
it
says
I
will
return
to
my
house
from
which
I
moved
25
And
on
arriving
it
finds
the
house
swept
clean
and
adorned
26
Then
it
goes
and
takes
along
seven
other
spirits
more
wicked
than
itself
and
after
getting
inside
they
dwell
there
So
the
final
circumstances
of
that
man
become
worse
than
the
first
27
Now
as
he
was
saying
these
things
a
woman
from
the
crowd
called
out
to
him
Happy
is
the
womb
that
carried
you
and
the
breasts
that
nursed
you
28
But
he
said
No
rather
happy
are
those
hearing
the
word
of
God
and
keeping
it
29
When
the
crowds
were
massing
together
he
began
to
say
This
generation
is
a
wicked
generation
it
looks
for
a
sign
but
no
sign
will
be
given
to
it
except
the
sign
of
Jonah
30
For
just
as
Jonah
became
a
sign
to
the
Ninevites
so
will
the
Son
of
man
be
to
this
generation
31
The
queen
of
the
south
will
be
raised
up
in
the
judgment
with
the
men
of
this
generation
and
will
condemn
them
for
she
came
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
hear
the
wisdom
of
Solomon
But
look
something
more
than
Solomon
is
here
32
The
men
of
Nineveh
will
rise
in
the
judgment
with
this
generation
and
will
condemn
it
because
they
repented
at
what
Jonah
preached
But
look
something
more
than
Jonah
is
here
33
After
lighting
a
lamp
a
person
puts
it
not
in
a
hidden
place
nor
under
a
basket
but
on
the
lampstand
so
that
those
who
come
in
may
see
the
light
34
The
lamp
of
the
body
is
your
eye
When
your
eye
is
focused
your
whole
body
is
also
bright
but
when
it
is
envious
your
body
is
also
dark
35
Be
alert
therefore
that
the
light
that
is
in
you
is
not
darkness
36
Therefore
if
your
whole
body
is
bright
with
no
part
of
it
dark
it
will
all
be
as
bright
as
when
a
lamp
gives
you
light
by
its
rays
37
When
he
had
said
this
a
Pharisee
asked
him
to
dine
with
him
So
he
went
in
and
reclined
at
the
table
38
However
the
Pharisee
was
surprised
at
seeing
that
he
did
not
first
wash
before
the
dinner
39
But
the
Lord
said
to
him
Now
you
Pharisees
you
cleanse
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
dish
but
inside
you
are
full
of
greediness
and
wickedness
40
Unreasonable
ones
The
one
who
made
the
outside
made
also
the
inside
did
he
not
41
But
give
as
gifts
of
mercy
the
things
that
are
from
within
and
look
everything
about
you
will
be
clean
42
But
woe
to
you
Pharisees
because
you
give
the
tenth
of
the
mint
and
of
the
rue
and
of
every
other
garden
herb
but
you
disregard
the
justice
and
the
love
of
God
These
things
you
were
under
obligation
to
do
but
not
to
disregard
those
other
things
43
Woe
to
you
Pharisees
because
you
love
the
front
seats
in
the
synagogues
and
the
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
44
Woe
to
you
because
you
are
as
those
graves
that
are
not
clearly
visible
that
men
walk
on
and
do
not
know
it
45
In
reply
one
of
those
versed
in
the
Law
said
to
him
Teacher
in
saying
these
things
you
insult
us
also
46
Then
he
said
Woe
also
to
you
who
are
versed
in
the
Law
because
you
load
men
down
with
loads
hard
to
carry
but
you
yourselves
do
not
touch
the
loads
with
one
of
your
fingers
47
Woe
to
you
because
you
build
the
tombs
of
the
prophets
but
your
forefathers
killed
them
48
Certainly
you
are
witnesses
of
the
deeds
of
your
forefathers
and
yet
you
approve
of
them
for
they
killed
the
prophets
but
you
are
building
their
tombs
49
That
is
why
the
wisdom
of
God
also
said
I
will
send
prophets
and
apostles
to
them
and
they
will
kill
and
persecute
some
of
them
50
so
that
the
blood
of
all
the
prophets
spilled
from
the
founding
of
the
world
may
be
charged
against
this
generation
51
from
the
blood
of
Abel
down
to
the
blood
of
Zechariah
who
was
killed
between
the
altar
and
the
house
Yes
I
tell
you
it
will
be
charged
against
this
generation
52
Woe
to
you
who
are
versed
in
the
Law
because
you
took
away
the
key
of
knowledge
You
yourselves
did
not
go
in
and
you
hinder
those
going
in
53
So
when
he
went
out
from
there
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
began
to
put
extreme
pressure
on
him
and
to
ply
him
with
many
more
questions
54
lying
in
wait
for
him
to
catch
him
in
something
he
might
say
1
In
the
meantime
when
a
crowd
of
so
many
thousands
had
gathered
together
that
they
were
stepping
on
one
another
he
started
by
saying
first
to
his
disciples
Watch
out
for
the
leaven
of
the
Pharisees
which
is
hypocrisy
2
But
there
is
nothing
carefully
concealed
that
will
not
be
revealed
and
nothing
secret
that
will
not
become
known
3
Therefore
whatever
you
say
in
the
darkness
will
be
heard
in
the
light
and
what
you
whisper
in
private
rooms
will
be
preached
from
the
housetops
4
Moreover
I
say
to
you
my
friends
do
not
fear
those
who
kill
the
body
and
after
this
are
not
able
to
do
anything
more
5
But
I
will
show
you
whom
to
fear
Fear
the
One
who
after
killing
has
authority
to
throw
into
Gehenna
Yes
I
tell
you
fear
this
One
6
Five
sparrows
sell
for
two
coins
of
small
value
do
they
not
Yet
not
one
of
them
is
forgotten
by
God
7
But
even
the
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered
Have
no
fear
you
are
worth
more
than
many
sparrows
8
I
say
to
you
everyone
who
acknowledges
me
before
men
the
Son
of
man
will
also
acknowledge
him
before
the
angels
of
God
9
But
whoever
disowns
me
before
men
will
be
disowned
before
the
angels
of
God
10
And
everyone
who
says
a
word
against
the
Son
of
man
it
will
be
forgiven
him
but
whoever
blasphemes
against
the
holy
spirit
will
not
be
forgiven
11
When
they
bring
you
in
before
public
assemblies
government
officials
and
authorities
do
not
become
anxious
about
how
or
what
you
will
speak
in
defense
or
what
you
will
say
12
for
the
holy
spirit
will
teach
you
in
that
very
hour
the
things
you
should
say
13
Then
someone
in
the
crowd
said
to
him
Teacher
tell
my
brother
to
divide
the
inheritance
with
me
14
He
said
to
him
Man
who
appointed
me
judge
or
arbitrator
between
you
two
15
Then
he
said
to
them
Keep
your
eyes
open
and
guard
against
every
sort
of
greed
because
even
when
a
person
has
an
abundance
his
life
does
not
result
from
the
things
he
possesses
16
With
that
he
told
them
an
illustration
saying
The
land
of
a
rich
man
produced
well
17
So
he
began
reasoning
within
himself
What
should
I
do
now
that
I
have
nowhere
to
gather
my
crops
18
Then
he
said
I
will
do
this
I
will
tear
down
my
storehouses
and
build
bigger
ones
and
there
I
will
gather
all
my
grain
and
all
my
goods
19
and
I
will
say
to
myself
You
have
many
good
things
stored
up
for
many
years
take
it
easy
eat
drink
enjoy
yourself
20
But
God
said
to
him
Unreasonable
one
this
night
they
are
demanding
your
life
from
you
Who
then
is
to
have
the
things
you
stored
up
21
So
it
goes
with
the
man
who
stores
up
treasure
for
himself
but
is
not
rich
toward
God
22
Then
he
said
to
his
disciples
That
is
why
I
say
to
you
stop
being
anxious
about
your
lives
as
to
what
you
will
eat
or
about
your
bodies
as
to
what
you
will
wear
23
For
the
life
is
worth
more
than
food
and
the
body
more
than
clothing
24
Consider
the
ravens
They
neither
sow
seed
nor
reap
they
have
neither
barn
nor
storehouse
yet
God
feeds
them
Are
you
not
worth
much
more
than
birds
25
Who
of
you
by
being
anxious
can
add
a
cubit
to
his
life
span
26
If
therefore
you
cannot
do
such
a
small
thing
why
be
anxious
about
the
remaining
things
27
Consider
how
the
lilies
grow
They
neither
toil
nor
spin
but
I
tell
you
that
not
even
Solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
arrayed
as
one
of
these
28
Now
if
this
is
how
God
clothes
the
vegetation
in
the
field
that
today
exists
and
tomorrow
is
cast
into
an
oven
how
much
more
will
he
clothe
you
you
with
little
faith
29
So
stop
seeking
what
you
will
eat
and
what
you
will
drink
and
stop
being
in
anxious
suspense
30
for
all
these
are
the
things
the
nations
of
the
world
are
eagerly
pursuing
but
your
Father
knows
you
need
these
things
31
Instead
keep
seeking
his
Kingdom
and
these
things
will
be
added
to
you
32
Have
no
fear
little
flock
for
your
Father
has
approved
of
giving
you
the
Kingdom
33
Sell
your
belongings
and
give
gifts
of
mercy
Make
money
pouches
that
do
not
wear
out
a
never-failing
treasure
in
the
heavens
where
no
thief
gets
near
and
no
moth
consumes
34
For
where
your
treasure
is
there
your
hearts
will
be
also
35
Be
dressed
and
ready
and
have
your
lamps
burning
36
and
you
should
be
like
men
waiting
for
their
master
to
return
from
the
marriage
so
when
he
comes
and
knocks
they
may
at
once
open
to
him
37
Happy
are
those
slaves
whom
the
master
on
coming
finds
watching
Truly
I
say
to
you
he
will
dress
himself
for
service
and
have
them
recline
at
the
table
and
will
come
alongside
and
minister
to
them
38
And
if
he
comes
in
the
second
watch
even
if
in
the
third
and
finds
them
ready
happy
are
they
39
But
know
this
if
the
householder
had
known
at
what
hour
the
thief
would
come
he
would
not
have
let
his
house
be
broken
into
40
You
also
keep
ready
because
at
an
hour
that
you
do
not
think
likely
the
Son
of
man
is
coming
41
Then
Peter
said
Lord
are
you
telling
this
illustration
just
to
us
or
also
to
everyone
42
And
the
Lord
said
Who
really
is
the
faithful
steward
the
discreet
one
whom
his
master
will
appoint
over
his
body
of
attendants
to
keep
giving
them
their
measure
of
food
supplies
at
the
proper
time
43
Happy
is
that
slave
if
his
master
on
coming
finds
him
doing
so
44
I
tell
you
truthfully
he
will
appoint
him
over
all
his
belongings
45
But
if
ever
that
slave
should
say
in
his
heart
My
master
delays
coming

and
starts
to
beat
the
male
and
female
servants
and
to
eat
and
drink
and
get
drunk
46
the
master
of
that
slave
will
come
on
a
day
that
he
is
not
expecting
him
and
at
an
hour
that
he
does
not
know
and
he
will
punish
him
with
the
greatest
severity
and
assign
him
a
part
with
the
unfaithful
ones
47
Then
that
slave
who
understood
the
will
of
his
master
but
did
not
get
ready
or
do
what
he
asked
will
be
beaten
with
many
strokes
48
But
the
one
who
did
not
understand
and
yet
did
things
deserving
of
strokes
will
be
beaten
with
few
Indeed
everyone
to
whom
much
was
given
much
will
be
demanded
of
him
and
the
one
who
was
put
in
charge
of
much
will
have
more
than
usual
demanded
of
him
49
I
came
to
start
a
fire
on
the
earth
and
what
more
is
there
for
me
to
wish
if
it
has
already
been
lit
50
Indeed
I
have
a
baptism
with
which
to
be
baptized
and
how
I
am
distressed
until
it
is
finished
51
Do
you
think
I
came
to
give
peace
on
the
earth
No
I
tell
you
but
rather
division
52
For
from
now
on
there
will
be
five
in
one
house
divided
three
against
two
and
two
against
three
53
They
will
be
divided
father
against
son
and
son
against
father
mother
against
daughter
and
daughter
against
mother
mother-in-law
against
daughter-in-law
and
daughter-in-law
against
mother-in-law
54
Then
he
also
said
to
the
crowds
When
you
see
a
cloud
rising
in
the
west
at
once
you
say
A
storm
is
coming

and
it
happens
55
And
when
you
see
that
a
south
wind
is
blowing
you
say
There
will
be
a
heat
wave

and
it
occurs
56
Hypocrites
you
know
how
to
examine
the
appearance
of
earth
and
sky
but
why
do
you
not
know
how
to
examine
this
particular
time
57
Why
do
you
not
judge
also
for
yourselves
what
is
righteous
58
For
example
when
you
are
going
with
your
legal
opponent
to
a
ruler
while
on
the
way
get
to
work
to
settle
the
dispute
with
him
so
that
he
may
not
summon
you
before
the
judge
and
the
judge
deliver
you
to
the
court
officer
and
the
court
officer
throw
you
into
prison
59
I
tell
you
you
will
certainly
not
get
out
of
there
until
you
pay
over
your
last
small
coin
1
At
that
time
some
who
were
present
reported
to
him
about
the
Galileans
whose
blood
Pilate
had
mixed
with
their
sacrifices
2
In
reply
he
said
to
them
Do
you
think
that
those
Galileans
were
worse
sinners
than
all
other
Galileans
because
they
have
suffered
these
things
3
No
I
tell
you
but
unless
you
repent
you
will
all
likewise
be
destroyed
4
Or
those
18
on
whom
the
tower
in
Siloam
fell
killing
them—do
you
think
that
they
had
greater
guilt
than
all
other
men
who
live
in
Jerusalem
5
No
I
tell
you
but
unless
you
repent
you
will
all
be
destroyed
as
they
were
6
Then
he
went
on
to
tell
this
illustration
A
man
had
a
fig
tree
planted
in
his
vineyard
and
he
came
looking
for
fruit
on
it
but
found
none
7
Then
he
said
to
the
vinedresser
Here
it
is
three
years
that
I
have
come
looking
for
fruit
on
this
fig
tree
but
have
found
none
Cut
it
down
Why
should
it
keep
the
ground
useless
8
In
reply
he
said
to
him
Master
leave
it
alone
for
one
more
year
until
I
dig
around
it
and
put
on
manure
9
If
it
produces
fruit
in
the
future
well
and
good
but
if
not
then
cut
it
down
10
Now
he
was
teaching
in
one
of
the
synagogues
on
the
Sabbath
11
And
look
a
woman
was
there
who
had
had
a
spirit
of
weakness
for
18
years
and
she
was
bent
double
and
was
unable
to
straighten
up
at
all
12
When
he
saw
her
Jesus
addressed
her
and
said
Woman
you
are
released
from
your
weakness
13
And
he
laid
his
hands
on
her
and
instantly
she
straightened
up
and
began
to
glorify
God
14
But
in
response
the
presiding
officer
of
the
synagogue
indignant
because
Jesus
did
the
cure
on
the
Sabbath
said
to
the
crowd
There
are
six
days
on
which
work
ought
to
be
done
so
come
and
be
cured
on
those
days
and
not
on
the
Sabbath
day
15
However
the
Lord
answered
him
Hypocrites
does
not
each
one
of
you
on
the
Sabbath
untie
his
bull
or
his
donkey
from
the
stall
and
lead
it
away
to
give
it
something
to
drink
16
Should
not
this
woman
who
is
a
daughter
of
Abraham
and
whom
Satan
held
bound
for
18
years
be
released
from
this
bondage
on
the
Sabbath
day
17
Well
when
he
said
these
things
all
his
opposers
began
to
feel
shame
but
the
entire
crowd
began
to
rejoice
at
all
the
glorious
things
he
did
18
So
he
went
on
to
say
What
is
the
Kingdom
of
God
like
and
with
what
can
I
compare
it
19
It
is
like
a
mustard
grain
that
a
man
took
and
planted
in
his
garden
and
it
grew
and
became
a
tree
and
the
birds
of
heaven
nested
in
its
branches
20
And
again
he
said
With
what
can
I
compare
the
Kingdom
of
God
21
It
is
like
leaven
that
a
woman
took
and
mixed
with
three
large
measures
of
flour
until
the
whole
mass
was
fermented
22
And
he
traveled
from
city
to
city
and
from
village
to
village
teaching
and
continuing
on
his
journey
to
Jerusalem
23
Now
a
man
said
to
him
Lord
are
those
being
saved
few
He
said
to
them
24
Exert
yourselves
vigorously
to
get
in
through
the
narrow
door
because
many
I
tell
you
will
seek
to
get
in
but
will
not
be
able
25
When
the
householder
gets
up
and
locks
the
door
you
will
stand
outside
knocking
at
the
door
saying
Lord
open
to
us
But
in
answer
he
will
say
to
you
I
do
not
know
where
you
are
from
26
Then
you
will
start
saying
We
ate
and
drank
in
your
presence
and
you
taught
in
our
main
streets
27
But
he
will
say
to
you
I
do
not
know
where
you
are
from
Get
away
from
me
all
you
workers
of
unrighteousness
28
There
is
where
your
weeping
and
the
gnashing
of
your
teeth
will
be
when
you
see
Abraham
Isaac
Jacob
and
all
the
prophets
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
but
you
yourselves
thrown
outside
29
Furthermore
people
will
come
from
east
and
west
and
from
north
and
south
and
will
recline
at
the
table
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
30
And
look
there
are
those
last
who
will
be
first
and
there
are
those
first
who
will
be
last
31
In
that
very
hour
some
of
the
Pharisees
came
up
and
told
him
Get
out
and
go
away
from
here
because
Herod
wants
to
kill
you
32
And
he
said
to
them
Go
and
tell
that
fox
Look
I
am
casting
out
demons
and
healing
people
today
and
tomorrow
and
on
the
third
day
I
will
be
finished
33
Nevertheless
I
must
go
on
today
tomorrow
and
the
following
day
because
it
cannot
be
that
a
prophet
should
be
put
to
death
outside
of
Jerusalem
34
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
the
killer
of
the
prophets
and
stoner
of
those
sent
to
her—how
often
I
wanted
to
gather
your
children
together
the
way
a
hen
gathers
her
brood
of
chicks
under
her
wings
But
you
did
not
want
it
35
Look
Your
house
is
abandoned
to
you
I
tell
you
you
will
by
no
means
see
me
until
you
say
Blessed
is
the
one
who
comes
in
Jehovahs
name
1
On
another
occasion
he
went
to
eat
a
meal
in
the
house
of
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
Pharisees
on
the
Sabbath
and
they
were
closely
watching
him
2
And
look
a
man
who
had
dropsy
was
in
front
of
him
3
So
in
response
Jesus
asked
those
versed
in
the
Law
and
the
Pharisees
Is
it
lawful
to
cure
on
the
Sabbath
or
not
4
But
they
kept
silent
With
that
he
took
hold
of
the
man
healed
him
and
sent
him
away
5
Then
he
said
to
them
Who
of
you
if
his
son
or
bull
falls
into
a
well
will
not
immediately
pull
him
out
on
the
Sabbath
day
6
And
they
were
not
able
to
reply
to
this
7
He
then
told
the
invited
men
an
illustration
when
he
noticed
how
they
were
choosing
the
most
prominent
places
for
themselves
He
said
to
them
8
When
you
are
invited
by
someone
to
a
marriage
feast
do
not
recline
in
the
most
prominent
place
Perhaps
someone
more
distinguished
than
you
may
also
have
been
invited
9
Then
the
one
who
invited
you
both
will
come
and
say
to
you
Let
this
man
have
your
place
Then
you
will
proceed
with
shame
to
take
the
lowest
place
10
But
when
you
are
invited
go
and
recline
in
the
lowest
place
so
that
when
the
man
who
invited
you
comes
he
will
say
to
you
Friend
go
on
up
higher
Then
you
will
have
honor
in
front
of
all
your
fellow
guests
11
For
everyone
who
exalts
himself
will
be
humbled
and
whoever
humbles
himself
will
be
exalted
12
Next
he
said
also
to
the
man
who
had
invited
him
When
you
spread
a
dinner
or
an
evening
meal
do
not
call
your
friends
or
your
brothers
or
your
relatives
or
your
rich
neighbors
Otherwise
they
might
also
invite
you
in
return
and
it
would
become
a
repayment
to
you
13
But
when
you
spread
a
feast
invite
the
poor
the
crippled
the
lame
the
blind
14
and
you
will
be
happy
because
they
have
nothing
with
which
to
repay
you
For
you
will
be
repaid
in
the
resurrection
of
the
righteous
ones
15
On
hearing
these
things
one
of
the
fellow
guests
said
to
him
Happy
is
the
one
who
dines
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
16
Jesus
said
to
him
A
man
was
spreading
a
grand
evening
meal
and
he
invited
many
17
He
sent
his
slave
out
at
the
hour
of
the
evening
meal
to
say
to
the
invited
ones
Come
because
everything
is
now
ready
18
But
they
all
alike
began
to
make
excuses
The
first
said
to
him
I
bought
a
field
and
need
to
go
out
and
see
it
I
ask
you
have
me
excused
19
And
another
said
I
bought
five
yoke
of
cattle
and
am
going
to
examine
them
I
ask
you
have
me
excused
20
Still
another
said
I
just
got
married
and
for
this
reason
I
cannot
come
21
So
the
slave
came
and
reported
these
things
to
his
master
Then
the
master
of
the
house
became
angry
and
said
to
his
slave
Go
out
quickly
to
the
main
streets
and
the
alleys
of
the
city
and
bring
in
here
the
poor
and
crippled
and
blind
and
lame
22
In
time
the
slave
said
Master
what
you
ordered
has
been
done
and
still
there
is
room
23
So
the
master
said
to
the
slave
Go
out
to
the
roads
and
the
lanes
and
compel
them
to
come
in
so
that
my
house
may
be
filled
24
For
I
say
to
you
none
of
those
men
who
were
invited
will
taste
my
evening
meal
25
Now
large
crowds
were
traveling
with
him
and
he
turned
and
said
to
them
26
If
anyone
comes
to
me
and
does
not
hate
his
father
and
mother
and
wife
and
children
and
brothers
and
sisters
yes
and
even
his
own
life
he
cannot
be
my
disciple
27
Whoever
does
not
carry
his
torture
stake
and
come
after
me
cannot
be
my
disciple
28
For
example
who
of
you
wanting
to
build
a
tower
does
not
first
sit
down
and
calculate
the
expense
to
see
if
he
has
enough
to
complete
it
29
Otherwise
he
might
lay
its
foundation
but
not
be
able
to
finish
it
and
all
the
onlookers
would
start
to
ridicule
him
30
saying
This
man
started
to
build
but
was
not
able
to
finish
31
Or
what
king
marching
out
against
another
king
in
war
does
not
first
sit
down
and
take
counsel
whether
he
is
able
with
10000
troops
to
stand
up
to
the
one
who
comes
against
him
with
20000
32
If
in
fact
he
cannot
do
so
then
while
that
one
is
yet
far
away
he
sends
out
a
body
of
ambassadors
and
sues
for
peace
33
In
the
same
way
you
may
be
sure
that
not
one
of
you
who
does
not
say
good-bye
to
all
his
belongings
can
be
my
disciple
34
Salt
to
be
sure
is
fine
But
if
the
salt
loses
its
strength
with
what
will
it
be
seasoned
35
It
is
not
suitable
for
soil
or
for
manure
People
throw
it
away
Let
the
one
who
has
ears
to
listen
listen
1
Now
all
the
tax
collectors
and
the
sinners
kept
gathering
around
him
to
hear
him
2
And
both
the
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
kept
muttering
This
man
welcomes
sinners
and
eats
with
them
3
Then
he
told
them
this
illustration
saying
4
What
man
among
you
with
100
sheep
on
losing
one
of
them
will
not
leave
the
99
behind
in
the
wilderness
and
go
after
the
lost
one
until
he
finds
it
5
And
when
he
has
found
it
he
puts
it
on
his
shoulders
and
rejoices
6
And
when
he
gets
home
he
calls
his
friends
and
his
neighbors
together
saying
to
them
Rejoice
with
me
for
I
have
found
my
sheep
that
was
lost
7
I
tell
you
that
in
the
same
way
there
will
be
more
joy
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
who
repents
than
over
99
righteous
ones
who
have
no
need
of
repentance
8
Or
what
woman
who
has
ten
drachma
coins
if
she
loses
one
of
the
drachmas
does
not
light
a
lamp
and
sweep
her
house
and
search
carefully
until
she
finds
it
9
And
when
she
has
found
it
she
calls
her
friends
and
neighbors
together
saying
Rejoice
with
me
for
I
have
found
the
drachma
coin
that
I
had
lost
10
In
the
same
way
I
tell
you
joy
arises
among
the
angels
of
God
over
one
sinner
who
repents
11
Then
he
said
A
man
had
two
sons
12
And
the
younger
one
said
to
his
father
Father
give
me
the
share
of
the
property
that
should
come
to
me
So
he
divided
his
belongings
between
them
13
A
few
days
later
the
younger
son
gathered
all
his
things
together
and
traveled
to
a
distant
country
and
there
squandered
his
property
by
living
a
debauched
life
14
When
he
had
spent
everything
a
severe
famine
occurred
throughout
that
country
and
he
fell
into
need
15
He
even
went
and
attached
himself
to
one
of
the
citizens
of
that
country
who
sent
him
into
his
fields
to
herd
swine
16
And
he
longed
to
be
filled
with
the
carob
pods
that
the
swine
were
eating
but
no
one
would
give
him
anything
17
When
he
came
to
his
senses
he
said
How
many
of
my
fathers
hired
men
have
more
than
enough
bread
while
I
am
dying
here
from
hunger
18
I
will
get
up
and
travel
to
my
father
and
say
to
him
Father
I
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
against
you
19
I
am
no
longer
worthy
of
being
called
your
son
Make
me
as
one
of
your
hired
men
20
So
he
got
up
and
went
to
his
father
While
he
was
still
a
long
way
off
his
father
caught
sight
of
him
and
was
moved
with
pity
and
he
ran
and
embraced
him
and
tenderly
kissed
him
21
Then
the
son
said
to
him
Father
I
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
against
you
I
am
no
longer
worthy
of
being
called
your
son
22
But
the
father
said
to
his
slaves
Quick
bring
out
a
robe
the
best
one
and
clothe
him
with
it
and
put
a
ring
on
his
hand
and
sandals
on
his
feet
23
Also
bring
the
fattened
calf
slaughter
it
and
let
us
eat
and
celebrate
24
for
this
son
of
mine
was
dead
but
has
come
to
life
again
he
was
lost
and
has
been
found
And
they
started
to
enjoy
themselves
25
Now
his
older
son
was
in
the
field
and
as
he
returned
and
got
near
the
house
he
heard
music
and
dancing
26
So
he
called
one
of
the
servants
to
him
and
asked
what
was
happening
27
He
said
to
him
Your
brother
has
come
and
your
father
slaughtered
the
fattened
calf
because
he
got
him
back
in
good
health
28
But
he
became
angry
and
refused
to
go
in
Then
his
father
came
out
and
began
to
plead
with
him
29
In
reply
he
said
to
his
father
Look
These
many
years
I
have
slaved
for
you
and
never
once
did
I
disobey
your
orders
and
yet
you
never
once
gave
me
a
young
goat
to
enjoy
with
my
friends
30
But
as
soon
as
this
son
of
yours
arrived
who
squandered
your
belongings
with
prostitutes
you
slaughtered
the
fattened
calf
for
him
31
Then
he
said
to
him
My
son
you
have
always
been
with
me
and
all
the
things
that
are
mine
are
yours
32
But
we
just
had
to
celebrate
and
rejoice
for
your
brother
was
dead
but
has
come
to
life
he
was
lost
and
has
been
found
1
Then
he
also
said
to
the
disciples
A
rich
man
had
a
steward
who
was
accused
of
handling
his
goods
wastefully
2
So
he
called
him
and
said
What
is
this
I
hear
about
you
Hand
in
the
account
of
your
stewardship
for
you
can
no
longer
manage
the
house
3
Then
the
steward
said
to
himself
What
am
I
to
do
seeing
that
my
master
is
taking
the
stewardship
away
from
me
I
am
not
strong
enough
to
dig
and
I
am
ashamed
to
beg
4
Ah
I
know
what
I
will
do
so
that
when
I
am
removed
from
the
stewardship
people
will
welcome
me
into
their
homes
5
And
calling
to
him
each
one
of
his
masters
debtors
he
said
to
the
first
How
much
do
you
owe
my
master
6
He
replied
A
hundred
measures
of
olive
oil
He
said
to
him
Take
back
your
written
agreement
and
sit
down
and
quickly
write
50
7
Next
he
said
to
another
one
Now
you
how
much
do
you
owe
He
said
A
hundred
large
measures
of
wheat
He
said
to
him
Take
back
your
written
agreement
and
write
80
8
And
his
master
commended
the
steward
though
unrighteous
because
he
acted
with
practical
wisdom
for
the
sons
of
this
system
of
things
are
wiser
in
a
practical
way
toward
their
own
generation
than
the
sons
of
the
light
are
9
Also
I
say
to
you
Make
friends
for
yourselves
by
means
of
the
unrighteous
riches
so
that
when
such
fail
they
may
receive
you
into
the
everlasting
dwelling
places
10
The
person
faithful
in
what
is
least
is
faithful
also
in
much
and
the
person
unrighteous
in
what
is
least
is
unrighteous
also
in
much
11
Therefore
if
you
have
not
proved
yourselves
faithful
in
connection
with
the
unrighteous
riches
who
will
entrust
you
with
what
is
true
12
And
if
you
have
not
proved
yourselves
faithful
in
connection
with
what
belongs
to
another
who
will
give
you
something
for
yourselves
13
No
servant
can
be
a
slave
to
two
masters
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one
and
love
the
other
or
he
will
stick
to
the
one
and
despise
the
other
You
cannot
be
slaves
to
God
and
to
Riches
14
Now
the
Pharisees
who
were
money
lovers
were
listening
to
all
these
things
and
they
began
to
sneer
at
him
15
So
he
said
to
them
You
are
those
who
declare
yourselves
righteous
before
men
but
God
knows
your
hearts
For
what
is
considered
exalted
by
men
is
a
disgusting
thing
in
Gods
sight
16
The
Law
and
the
Prophets
were
until
John
From
then
on
the
Kingdom
of
God
is
being
declared
as
good
news
and
every
sort
of
person
is
pressing
forward
toward
it
17
Indeed
it
is
easier
for
heaven
and
earth
to
pass
away
than
for
one
stroke
of
a
letter
of
the
Law
to
go
unfulfilled
18
Everyone
who
divorces
his
wife
and
marries
another
commits
adultery
and
whoever
marries
a
woman
divorced
from
her
husband
commits
adultery
19
There
was
a
rich
man
who
used
to
dress
in
purple
and
linen
enjoying
himself
day
after
day
with
magnificence
20
But
a
beggar
named
Lazarus
used
to
be
put
at
his
gate
covered
with
ulcers
21
and
desiring
to
be
filled
with
the
things
dropping
from
the
table
of
the
rich
man
Yes
even
the
dogs
would
come
and
lick
his
ulcers
22
Now
in
the
course
of
time
the
beggar
died
and
was
carried
off
by
the
angels
to
Abrahams
side
Also
the
rich
man
died
and
was
buried
23
And
in
the
Grave
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
being
in
torment
and
he
saw
Abraham
from
afar
and
Lazarus
by
his
side
24
So
he
called
and
said
Father
Abraham
have
mercy
on
me
and
send
Lazarus
to
dip
the
tip
of
his
finger
in
water
and
cool
my
tongue
for
I
am
in
anguish
in
this
blazing
fire
25
But
Abraham
said
Child
remember
that
you
had
your
fill
of
good
things
in
your
lifetime
but
Lazarus
for
his
part
received
bad
things
Now
however
he
is
being
comforted
here
but
you
are
in
anguish
26
And
besides
all
these
things
a
great
chasm
has
been
fixed
between
us
and
you
so
that
those
who
want
to
go
over
from
here
to
you
cannot
neither
may
people
cross
over
from
there
to
us
27
Then
he
said
That
being
so
I
ask
you
father
to
send
him
to
the
house
of
my
father
28
for
I
have
five
brothers
in
order
that
he
may
give
them
a
thorough
witness
so
that
they
will
not
also
come
into
this
place
of
torment
29
But
Abraham
said
They
have
Moses
and
the
Prophets
let
them
listen
to
these
30
Then
he
said
No
indeed
father
Abraham
but
if
someone
from
the
dead
goes
to
them
they
will
repent
31
But
he
said
to
him
If
they
do
not
listen
to
Moses
and
the
Prophets
neither
will
they
be
persuaded
if
someone
rises
from
the
dead
1
Then
he
said
to
his
disciples
It
is
unavoidable
that
causes
for
stumbling
should
come
Nevertheless
woe
to
the
one
through
whom
they
come
2
It
would
be
more
advantageous
for
him
if
a
millstone
were
hung
from
his
neck
and
he
were
thrown
into
the
sea
than
for
him
to
stumble
one
of
these
little
ones
3
Pay
attention
to
yourselves
If
your
brother
commits
a
sin
rebuke
him
and
if
he
repents
forgive
him
4
Even
if
he
sins
seven
times
a
day
against
you
and
he
comes
back
to
you
seven
times
saying
I
repent

you
must
forgive
him
5
Now
the
apostles
said
to
the
Lord
Give
us
more
faith
6
Then
the
Lord
said
If
you
had
faith
the
size
of
a
mustard
grain
you
would
say
to
this
black
mulberry
tree
Be
uprooted
and
planted
in
the
sea
and
it
would
obey
you
7
Which
one
of
you
who
has
a
slave
plowing
or
shepherding
would
say
to
him
when
he
comes
in
from
the
field
Come
here
at
once
and
dine
at
the
table
8
Rather
will
he
not
say
to
him
Get
something
ready
for
me
to
have
my
evening
meal
and
put
on
an
apron
and
serve
me
until
I
finish
eating
and
drinking
and
afterward
you
can
eat
and
drink
9
He
will
not
feel
gratitude
to
the
slave
because
he
did
what
was
assigned
will
he
10
Likewise
when
you
have
done
all
the
things
assigned
to
you
say
We
are
good-for-nothing
slaves
What
we
have
done
is
what
we
ought
to
have
done
11
While
he
was
going
to
Jerusalem
he
was
passing
between
Samaria
and
Galilee
12
And
as
he
was
entering
a
village
ten
men
with
leprosy
met
him
but
they
stood
at
a
distance
13
And
they
raised
their
voices
and
said
Jesus
Instructor
have
mercy
on
us
14
When
he
saw
them
he
said
to
them
Go
and
show
yourselves
to
the
priests
Then
as
they
were
going
off
they
were
cleansed
15
One
of
them
when
he
saw
that
he
was
healed
turned
back
glorifying
God
with
a
loud
voice
16
And
he
fell
facedown
at
Jesus
feet
thanking
him
Furthermore
he
was
a
Samaritan
17
In
reply
Jesus
said
All
ten
were
cleansed
were
they
not
Where
then
are
the
other
nine
18
Did
no
one
else
turn
back
to
give
glory
to
God
except
this
man
of
another
nation
19
Then
he
said
to
him
Get
up
and
be
on
your
way
your
faith
has
made
you
well
20
On
being
asked
by
the
Pharisees
when
the
Kingdom
of
God
was
coming
he
answered
them
The
Kingdom
of
God
is
not
coming
with
striking
observableness
21
nor
will
people
say
See
here
or
There
For
look
the
Kingdom
of
God
is
in
your
midst
22
Then
he
said
to
the
disciples
Days
will
come
when
you
will
desire
to
see
one
of
the
days
of
the
Son
of
man
but
you
will
not
see
it
23
And
people
will
say
to
you
See
there
or
See
here
Do
not
go
out
or
chase
after
them
24
For
just
as
lightning
flashes
from
one
part
of
heaven
to
another
part
of
heaven
so
the
Son
of
man
will
be
in
his
day
25
First
however
he
must
undergo
many
sufferings
and
be
rejected
by
this
generation
26
Moreover
just
as
it
occurred
in
the
days
of
Noah
so
it
will
be
in
the
days
of
the
Son
of
man
27
they
were
eating
they
were
drinking
men
were
marrying
women
were
being
given
in
marriage
until
that
day
when
Noah
entered
into
the
ark
and
the
Flood
came
and
destroyed
them
all
28
Likewise
just
as
it
occurred
in
the
days
of
Lot
they
were
eating
they
were
drinking
they
were
buying
they
were
selling
they
were
planting
they
were
building
29
But
on
the
day
that
Lot
went
out
of
Sodom
it
rained
fire
and
sulfur
from
heaven
and
destroyed
them
all
30
It
will
be
the
same
on
that
day
when
the
Son
of
man
is
revealed
31
On
that
day
let
the
person
who
is
on
the
housetop
but
whose
belongings
are
in
the
house
not
come
down
to
pick
these
up
and
likewise
the
person
out
in
the
field
must
not
return
to
the
things
behind
32
Remember
the
wife
of
Lot
33
Whoever
seeks
to
keep
his
life
safe
will
lose
it
but
whoever
loses
it
will
preserve
it
alive
34
I
tell
you
in
that
night
two
people
will
be
in
one
bed
the
one
will
be
taken
along
but
the
other
will
be
abandoned
35
There
will
be
two
women
grinding
at
the
same
mill
the
one
will
be
taken
along
but
the
other
will
be
abandoned
36
——
37
So
in
response
they
said
to
him
Where
Lord
He
said
to
them
Where
the
body
is
there
also
the
eagles
will
be
gathered
together
1
Then
he
went
on
to
tell
them
an
illustration
about
the
need
for
them
always
to
pray
and
not
to
give
up
2
saying
In
a
certain
city
there
was
a
judge
who
had
no
fear
of
God
and
no
respect
for
man
3
There
was
also
a
widow
in
that
city
who
kept
going
to
him
and
saying
See
that
I
get
justice
from
my
legal
opponent
4
Well
for
a
while
he
was
unwilling
but
afterward
he
said
to
himself
Although
I
do
not
fear
God
or
respect
any
man
5
because
this
widow
keeps
making
me
trouble
I
will
see
that
she
gets
justice
so
that
she
will
not
keep
coming
and
wearing
me
out
with
her
demand
6
Then
the
Lord
said
Hear
what
the
judge
although
unrighteous
said
7
Certainly
then
will
not
God
cause
justice
to
be
done
for
his
chosen
ones
who
cry
out
to
him
day
and
night
while
he
is
patient
toward
them
8
I
tell
you
he
will
cause
justice
to
be
done
to
them
speedily
Nevertheless
when
the
Son
of
man
arrives
will
he
really
find
this
faith
on
the
earth
9
He
also
told
this
illustration
to
some
who
trusted
in
their
own
righteousness
and
who
considered
others
as
nothing
10
Two
men
went
up
into
the
temple
to
pray
the
one
a
Pharisee
and
the
other
a
tax
collector
11
The
Pharisee
stood
and
began
to
pray
these
things
to
himself
O
God
I
thank
you
that
I
am
not
like
everyone
else—extortioners
unrighteous
adulterers—or
even
like
this
tax
collector
12
I
fast
twice
a
week
I
give
the
tenth
of
all
things
I
acquire
13
But
the
tax
collector
standing
at
a
distance
was
not
willing
even
to
raise
his
eyes
heavenward
but
kept
beating
his
chest
saying
O
God
be
gracious
to
me
a
sinner
14
I
tell
you
this
man
went
down
to
his
home
and
was
proved
more
righteous
than
that
Pharisee
Because
everyone
who
exalts
himself
will
be
humiliated
but
whoever
humbles
himself
will
be
exalted
15
Now
people
were
also
bringing
him
their
infants
for
him
to
touch
them
but
on
seeing
this
the
disciples
began
to
reprimand
them
16
However
Jesus
called
the
infants
to
him
saying
Let
the
young
children
come
to
me
and
do
not
try
to
stop
them
for
the
Kingdom
of
God
belongs
to
such
ones
17
Truly
I
say
to
you
whoever
does
not
receive
the
Kingdom
of
God
like
a
young
child
will
by
no
means
enter
into
it
18
And
one
of
the
rulers
questioned
him
saying
Good
Teacher
what
must
I
do
to
inherit
everlasting
life
19
Jesus
said
to
him
Why
do
you
call
me
good
Nobody
is
good
except
one
God
20
You
know
the
commandments
Do
not
commit
adultery
do
not
murder
do
not
steal
do
not
bear
false
witness
honor
your
father
and
your
mother
21
Then
he
said
All
of
these
I
have
kept
from
youth
on
22
After
hearing
that
Jesus
said
to
him
There
is
still
one
thing
lacking
about
you
Sell
all
the
things
you
have
and
distribute
the
proceeds
to
the
poor
and
you
will
have
treasure
in
the
heavens
and
come
be
my
follower
23
When
he
heard
this
he
became
deeply
grieved
for
he
was
very
rich
24
Jesus
looked
at
him
and
said
How
difficult
it
will
be
for
those
having
money
to
make
their
way
into
the
Kingdom
of
God
25
It
is
easier
in
fact
for
a
camel
to
get
through
the
eye
of
a
sewing
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
Kingdom
of
God
26
Those
who
heard
this
said
Who
possibly
can
be
saved
27
He
said
The
things
impossible
with
men
are
possible
with
God
28
But
Peter
said
Look
We
have
left
what
was
ours
and
followed
you
29
He
said
to
them
Truly
I
say
to
you
there
is
no
one
who
has
left
house
or
wife
or
brothers
or
parents
or
children
for
the
sake
of
the
Kingdom
of
God
30
who
will
not
get
many
times
more
in
this
period
of
time
and
in
the
coming
system
of
things
everlasting
life
31
Then
he
took
the
Twelve
aside
and
said
to
them
Look
We
are
going
up
to
Jerusalem
and
all
the
things
written
by
means
of
the
prophets
about
the
Son
of
man
will
be
accomplished
32
For
instance
he
will
be
handed
over
to
men
of
the
nations
and
will
be
mocked
and
treated
insolently
and
spat
on
33
And
after
scourging
him
they
will
kill
him
but
on
the
third
day
he
will
rise
34
However
they
did
not
get
the
meaning
of
any
of
these
things
for
these
words
were
hidden
from
them
and
they
did
not
understand
the
things
said
35
Now
as
Jesus
was
getting
near
to
Jericho
a
blind
man
was
sitting
beside
the
road
begging
36
Because
he
heard
a
crowd
passing
by
he
began
to
inquire
what
was
going
on
37
They
reported
to
him
Jesus
the
Nazarene
is
passing
by
38
At
that
he
cried
out
Jesus
Son
of
David
have
mercy
on
me
39
And
those
who
were
in
front
began
rebuking
him
telling
him
to
keep
quiet
but
all
the
more
he
kept
shouting
Son
of
David
have
mercy
on
me
40
Then
Jesus
stopped
and
commanded
that
the
man
be
brought
to
him
After
he
came
near
Jesus
asked
him
41
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
for
you
He
said
Lord
let
me
recover
my
sight
42
So
Jesus
said
to
him
Recover
your
sight
your
faith
has
made
you
well
43
And
instantly
he
recovered
his
sight
and
he
began
to
follow
him
glorifying
God
Also
at
seeing
it
all
the
people
gave
praise
to
God
1
He
then
entered
Jericho
and
was
passing
through
2
Now
a
man
named
Zacchaeus
was
there
he
was
a
chief
tax
collector
and
he
was
rich
3
Well
he
was
trying
to
see
who
this
Jesus
was
but
he
could
not
see
because
of
the
crowd
since
he
was
short
4
So
he
ran
ahead
and
climbed
a
sycamore
tree
in
order
to
see
him
for
he
was
about
to
pass
that
way
5
Now
when
Jesus
got
to
the
place
he
looked
up
and
said
to
him
Zacchaeus
hurry
and
get
down
for
today
I
must
stay
in
your
house
6
With
that
he
hurried
down
and
joyfully
welcomed
him
as
a
guest
7
When
they
saw
this
they
were
all
muttering
He
went
as
a
guest
to
the
house
of
a
man
who
is
a
sinner
8
But
Zacchaeus
stood
up
and
said
to
the
Lord
Look
The
half
of
my
belongings
Lord
I
am
giving
to
the
poor
and
whatever
I
extorted
from
anyone
I
am
restoring
four
times
over
9
At
this
Jesus
said
to
him
Today
salvation
has
come
to
this
house
because
he
too
is
a
son
of
Abraham
10
For
the
Son
of
man
came
to
seek
and
to
save
what
was
lost
11
While
they
were
listening
to
these
things
he
told
another
illustration
because
he
was
near
Jerusalem
and
they
thought
that
the
Kingdom
of
God
was
going
to
appear
instantly
12
So
he
said
A
man
of
noble
birth
traveled
to
a
distant
land
to
secure
kingly
power
for
himself
and
to
return
13
Calling
ten
of
his
slaves
he
gave
them
ten
minas
and
told
them
Do
business
with
these
until
I
come
14
But
his
citizens
hated
him
and
sent
out
a
body
of
ambassadors
after
him
to
say
We
do
not
want
this
man
to
become
king
over
us
15
When
he
eventually
got
back
after
having
secured
the
kingly
power
he
summoned
the
slaves
to
whom
he
had
given
the
money
in
order
to
ascertain
what
they
had
gained
by
their
business
activity
16
So
the
first
one
came
forward
and
said
Lord
your
mina
gained
ten
minas
17
He
said
to
him
Well
done
good
slave
Because
in
a
very
small
matter
you
have
proved
yourself
faithful
hold
authority
over
ten
cities
18
Now
the
second
came
saying
Your
mina
Lord
made
five
minas
19
He
said
to
this
one
as
well
You
too
be
in
charge
of
five
cities
20
But
another
one
came
saying
Lord
here
is
your
mina
that
I
kept
hidden
away
in
a
cloth
21
You
see
I
was
in
fear
of
you
because
you
are
a
harsh
man
you
take
what
you
did
not
deposit
and
you
reap
what
you
did
not
sow
22
He
said
to
him
By
your
own
words
I
judge
you
wicked
slave
You
knew
did
you
that
I
am
a
harsh
man
taking
what
I
did
not
deposit
and
reaping
what
I
did
not
sow
23
So
why
did
you
not
put
my
money
in
a
bank
Then
on
my
coming
I
would
have
collected
it
with
interest
24
With
that
he
said
to
those
standing
by
Take
the
mina
from
him
and
give
it
to
the
one
who
has
the
ten
minas
25
But
they
said
to
him
Lord
he
has
ten
minas—
26
I
say
to
you
to
everyone
who
has
more
will
be
given
but
from
the
one
who
does
not
have
even
what
he
has
will
be
taken
away
27
Moreover
bring
these
enemies
of
mine
here
who
did
not
want
me
to
become
king
over
them
and
execute
them
in
front
of
me
28
After
he
had
said
these
things
he
went
on
ahead
going
up
to
Jerusalem
29
And
when
he
got
near
to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
at
the
mountain
called
Mount
of
Olives
he
sent
two
of
the
disciples
30
saying
Go
into
the
village
that
is
within
sight
and
after
you
enter
it
you
will
find
a
colt
tied
on
which
no
man
has
ever
sat
Untie
it
and
bring
it
here
31
But
if
anyone
asks
you
Why
are
you
untying
it
you
must
say
The
Lord
needs
it
32
So
those
who
were
sent
went
away
and
found
it
just
as
he
had
said
to
them
33
But
as
they
were
untying
the
colt
its
owners
said
to
them
Why
are
you
untying
the
colt
34
They
said
The
Lord
needs
it
35
And
they
led
it
to
Jesus
and
they
threw
their
outer
garments
on
the
colt
and
seated
Jesus
on
it
36
As
he
moved
along
they
were
spreading
their
outer
garments
on
the
road
37
As
soon
as
he
got
near
the
road
down
the
Mount
of
Olives
the
whole
multitude
of
the
disciples
began
to
rejoice
and
to
praise
God
with
a
loud
voice
because
of
all
the
powerful
works
they
had
seen
38
saying
Blessed
is
the
one
coming
as
the
King
in
Jehovahs
name
Peace
in
heaven
and
glory
in
the
heights
above
39
However
some
of
the
Pharisees
from
the
crowd
said
to
him
Teacher
rebuke
your
disciples
40
But
in
reply
he
said
I
tell
you
if
these
remained
silent
the
stones
would
cry
out
41
And
when
he
got
nearby
he
viewed
the
city
and
wept
over
it
42
saying
If
you
even
you
had
discerned
on
this
day
the
things
having
to
do
with
peace—but
now
they
have
been
hidden
from
your
eyes
43
Because
the
days
will
come
upon
you
when
your
enemies
will
build
around
you
a
fortification
of
pointed
stakes
and
will
encircle
you
and
besiege
you
from
every
side
44
They
will
dash
you
and
your
children
within
you
to
the
ground
and
they
will
not
leave
a
stone
upon
a
stone
in
you
because
you
did
not
discern
the
time
of
your
being
inspected
45
Then
he
entered
the
temple
and
started
to
throw
out
those
who
were
selling
46
saying
to
them
It
is
written
My
house
will
be
a
house
of
prayer

but
you
have
made
it
a
cave
of
robbers
47
He
continued
teaching
daily
in
the
temple
But
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
principal
ones
of
the
people
were
seeking
to
kill
him
48
but
they
did
not
find
any
way
to
do
this
for
the
people
one
and
all
kept
hanging
on
to
him
to
hear
him
1
On
one
of
the
days
while
he
was
teaching
the
people
in
the
temple
and
declaring
the
good
news
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
with
the
elders
came
2
and
said
to
him
Tell
us
by
what
authority
do
you
do
these
things
Or
who
gave
you
this
authority
3
He
replied
to
them
I
will
also
ask
you
a
question
and
you
tell
me
4
Was
the
baptism
of
John
from
heaven
or
from
men
5
Then
they
drew
conclusions
among
themselves
saying
If
we
say
From
heaven

he
will
say
Why
did
you
not
believe
him
6
But
if
we
say
From
men

the
people
one
and
all
will
stone
us
for
they
are
convinced
that
John
was
a
prophet
7
So
they
replied
that
they
did
not
know
its
source
8
Jesus
said
to
them
Neither
am
I
telling
you
by
what
authority
I
do
these
things
9
Then
he
began
to
tell
the
people
this
illustration
A
man
planted
a
vineyard
and
leased
it
to
cultivators
and
he
traveled
abroad
for
a
considerable
time
10
In
due
season
he
sent
a
slave
to
the
cultivators
so
that
they
would
give
him
some
of
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard
The
cultivators
however
sent
him
away
empty-handed
after
beating
him
11
But
again
he
sent
another
slave
That
one
also
they
beat
and
humiliated
and
sent
away
empty-handed
12
Yet
again
he
sent
a
third
this
one
also
they
wounded
and
threw
out
13
At
this
the
owner
of
the
vineyard
said
What
should
I
do
I
will
send
my
son
the
beloved
They
will
likely
respect
this
one
14
When
the
cultivators
caught
sight
of
him
they
reasoned
with
one
another
saying
This
is
the
heir
Let
us
kill
him
so
that
the
inheritance
may
become
ours
15
So
they
threw
him
out
of
the
vineyard
and
killed
him
What
then
will
the
owner
of
the
vineyard
do
to
them
16
He
will
come
and
kill
these
cultivators
and
will
give
the
vineyard
to
others
On
hearing
this
they
said
Never
may
that
happen
17
But
he
looked
straight
at
them
and
said
What
then
does
this
mean
where
it
is
written
The
stone
that
the
builders
rejected
this
has
become
the
chief
cornerstone
18
Everyone
falling
on
that
stone
will
be
shattered
As
for
anyone
on
whom
it
falls
it
will
crush
him
19
The
scribes
and
the
chief
priests
then
sought
to
get
their
hands
on
him
in
that
very
hour
but
they
feared
the
people
for
they
realized
that
he
told
this
illustration
with
them
in
mind
20
And
after
observing
him
closely
they
sent
men
whom
they
had
secretly
hired
to
pretend
that
they
were
righteous
in
order
to
catch
him
in
his
speech
so
as
to
turn
him
over
to
the
government
and
to
the
authority
of
the
governor
21
And
they
questioned
him
saying
Teacher
we
know
you
speak
and
teach
correctly
and
show
no
partiality
but
you
teach
the
way
of
God
in
line
with
truth
22
Is
it
lawful
for
us
to
pay
head
tax
to
Caesar
or
not
23
But
he
detected
their
cunning
and
said
to
them
24
Show
me
a
denarius
Whose
image
and
inscription
does
it
have
They
said
Caesars
25
He
said
to
them
By
all
means
then
pay
back
Caesars
things
to
Caesar
but
Gods
things
to
God
26
Well
they
were
not
able
to
trap
him
in
his
speech
before
the
people
but
amazed
at
his
answer
they
became
silent
27
However
some
of
the
Sadducees
those
who
say
there
is
no
resurrection
came
and
asked
him
28
Teacher
Moses
wrote
us
If
a
mans
brother
dies
leaving
a
wife
but
he
was
childless
his
brother
should
take
the
wife
and
raise
up
offspring
for
his
brother
29
Now
there
were
seven
brothers
The
first
took
a
wife
but
died
childless
30
So
the
second
31
and
the
third
married
her
Likewise
even
all
seven
they
died
and
left
no
children
32
Finally
the
woman
also
died
33
Consequently
in
the
resurrection
whose
wife
will
she
become
For
the
seven
had
her
as
a
wife
34
Jesus
said
to
them
The
children
of
this
system
of
things
marry
and
are
given
in
marriage
35
but
those
who
have
been
counted
worthy
of
gaining
that
system
of
things
and
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
36
In
fact
neither
can
they
die
anymore
for
they
are
like
the
angels
and
they
are
Gods
children
by
being
children
of
the
resurrection
37
But
that
the
dead
are
raised
up
even
Moses
made
known
in
the
account
about
the
thornbush
when
he
calls
Jehovah
the
God
of
Abraham
and
God
of
Isaac
and
God
of
Jacob
38
He
is
a
God
not
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
for
they
are
all
living
to
him
39
In
response
some
of
the
scribes
said
Teacher
you
spoke
well
40
For
they
no
longer
had
the
courage
to
ask
him
a
single
question
41
In
turn
he
asked
them
How
is
it
they
say
that
the
Christ
is
Davids
son
42
For
David
himself
says
in
the
book
of
Psalms
Jehovah
said
to
my
Lord
Sit
at
my
right
hand
43
until
I
place
your
enemies
as
a
stool
for
your
feet
44
David
therefore
calls
him
Lord
so
how
is
he
his
son
45
Then
while
all
the
people
were
listening
he
said
to
his
disciples
46
Beware
of
the
scribes
who
like
to
walk
around
in
robes
and
who
love
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
front
seats
in
the
synagogues
and
the
most
prominent
places
at
evening
meals
47
and
who
devour
the
houses
of
the
widows
and
for
show
make
long
prayers
These
will
receive
a
more
severe
judgment
1
Now
as
he
looked
up
he
saw
the
rich
dropping
their
gifts
into
the
treasury
chests
2
Then
he
saw
a
needy
widow
drop
in
two
small
coins
of
very
little
value
3
and
he
said
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
this
poor
widow
put
in
more
than
they
all
did
4
For
all
of
these
put
in
gifts
out
of
their
surplus
but
she
out
of
her
want
put
in
all
the
means
of
living
she
had
5
Later
when
some
were
speaking
about
the
temple
how
it
was
adorned
with
fine
stones
and
dedicated
things
6
he
said
As
for
these
things
that
you
now
see
the
days
will
come
when
not
a
stone
will
be
left
upon
a
stone
and
not
be
thrown
down
7
Then
they
questioned
him
saying
Teacher
when
will
these
things
actually
be
and
what
will
be
the
sign
when
these
things
are
to
occur
8
He
said
Look
out
that
you
are
not
misled
for
many
will
come
on
the
basis
of
my
name
saying
I
am
he

and
The
due
time
is
near
Do
not
go
after
them
9
Furthermore
when
you
hear
of
wars
and
disturbances
do
not
be
terrified
For
these
things
must
take
place
first
but
the
end
will
not
occur
immediately
10
Then
he
said
to
them
Nation
will
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
11
There
will
be
great
earthquakes
and
in
one
place
after
another
food
shortages
and
pestilences
and
there
will
be
fearful
sights
and
from
heaven
great
signs
12
But
before
all
these
things
happen
people
will
lay
their
hands
on
you
and
persecute
you
handing
you
over
to
the
synagogues
and
prisons
You
will
be
brought
before
kings
and
governors
for
the
sake
of
my
name
13
It
will
result
in
your
giving
a
witness
14
Therefore
resolve
in
your
hearts
not
to
rehearse
beforehand
how
to
make
your
defense
15
for
I
will
give
you
words
and
wisdom
that
all
your
opposers
together
will
not
be
able
to
resist
or
dispute
16
Moreover
you
will
be
handed
over
even
by
parents
and
brothers
and
relatives
and
friends
and
they
will
put
some
of
you
to
death
17
and
you
will
be
hated
by
all
people
because
of
my
name
18
But
not
even
a
hair
of
your
heads
will
perish
19
By
your
endurance
you
will
preserve
your
lives
20
However
when
you
see
Jerusalem
surrounded
by
encamped
armies
then
know
that
the
desolating
of
her
has
drawn
near
21
Then
let
those
in
Judea
begin
fleeing
to
the
mountains
let
those
in
the
midst
of
her
leave
and
let
those
in
the
countryside
not
enter
into
her
22
because
these
are
days
for
meting
out
justice
in
order
that
all
the
things
written
may
be
fulfilled
23
Woe
to
the
pregnant
women
and
those
nursing
a
baby
in
those
days
For
there
will
be
great
distress
on
the
land
and
wrath
against
this
people
24
And
they
will
fall
by
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
be
led
captive
into
all
the
nations
and
Jerusalem
will
be
trampled
on
by
the
nations
until
the
appointed
times
of
the
nations
are
fulfilled
25
Also
there
will
be
signs
in
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
on
the
earth
anguish
of
nations
not
knowing
the
way
out
because
of
the
roaring
of
the
sea
and
its
agitation
26
People
will
become
faint
out
of
fear
and
expectation
of
the
things
coming
upon
the
inhabited
earth
for
the
powers
of
the
heavens
will
be
shaken
27
And
then
they
will
see
the
Son
of
man
coming
in
a
cloud
with
power
and
great
glory
28
But
as
these
things
start
to
occur
stand
up
straight
and
lift
up
your
heads
because
your
deliverance
is
getting
near
29
With
that
he
told
them
an
illustration
Notice
the
fig
tree
and
all
the
other
trees
30
When
they
are
budding
you
see
it
for
yourselves
and
know
that
now
the
summer
is
near
31
Likewise
also
you
when
you
see
these
things
happening
know
that
the
Kingdom
of
God
is
near
32
Truly
I
say
to
you
that
this
generation
will
by
no
means
pass
away
until
all
things
happen
33
Heaven
and
earth
will
pass
away
but
my
words
will
by
no
means
pass
away
34
But
pay
attention
to
yourselves
that
your
hearts
never
become
weighed
down
with
overeating
and
heavy
drinking
and
anxieties
of
life
and
suddenly
that
day
be
instantly
upon
you
35
as
a
snare
For
it
will
come
upon
all
those
dwelling
on
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
36
Keep
awake
then
all
the
time
making
supplication
that
you
may
succeed
in
escaping
all
these
things
that
must
occur
and
in
standing
before
the
Son
of
man
37
So
by
day
he
would
be
teaching
in
the
temple
but
by
night
he
would
go
out
and
lodge
on
the
mountain
called
the
Mount
of
Olives
38
And
all
the
people
would
come
to
him
early
in
the
morning
to
hear
him
in
the
temple
1
Now
the
Festival
of
the
Unleavened
Bread
which
is
called
Passover
was
getting
near
2
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
were
looking
for
an
effective
way
to
get
rid
of
him
because
they
were
afraid
of
the
people
3
Then
Satan
entered
into
Judas
the
one
called
Iscariot
who
was
numbered
among
the
Twelve
4
and
he
went
off
and
talked
with
the
chief
priests
and
temple
captains
about
how
to
betray
him
to
them
5
They
were
delighted
at
this
and
agreed
to
give
him
silver
money
6
So
he
consented
and
began
looking
for
a
good
opportunity
to
betray
him
to
them
without
a
crowd
around
7
The
day
of
the
Unleavened
Bread
now
arrived
on
which
the
Passover
sacrifice
must
be
offered
8
so
Jesus
sent
Peter
and
John
saying
Go
and
get
the
Passover
ready
for
us
to
eat
9
They
said
to
him
Where
do
you
want
us
to
get
it
ready
10
He
said
to
them
Look
When
you
enter
into
the
city
a
man
carrying
an
earthenware
water
jar
will
meet
you
Follow
him
into
the
house
that
he
enters
11
And
say
to
the
landlord
of
the
house
The
Teacher
says
to
you
Where
is
the
guest
room
where
I
may
eat
the
Passover
with
my
disciples
12
And
that
man
will
show
you
a
large
furnished
upper
room
Get
it
ready
there
13
So
they
left
and
found
it
just
as
he
had
told
them
and
they
prepared
for
the
Passover
14
So
when
the
hour
came
he
reclined
at
the
table
along
with
the
apostles
15
And
he
said
to
them
I
have
greatly
desired
to
eat
this
Passover
with
you
before
I
suffer
16
for
I
tell
you
I
will
not
eat
it
again
until
it
is
fulfilled
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
17
And
accepting
a
cup
he
gave
thanks
and
said
Take
this
and
pass
it
from
one
to
the
other
among
yourselves
18
for
I
tell
you
from
now
on
I
will
not
drink
again
from
the
product
of
the
vine
until
the
Kingdom
of
God
comes
19
Also
he
took
a
loaf
gave
thanks
broke
it
and
gave
it
to
them
saying
This
means
my
body
which
is
to
be
given
in
your
behalf
Keep
doing
this
in
remembrance
of
me
20
Also
he
did
the
same
with
the
cup
after
they
had
the
evening
meal
saying
This
cup
means
the
new
covenant
by
virtue
of
my
blood
which
is
to
be
poured
out
in
your
behalf
21
But
look
the
hand
of
my
betrayer
is
with
me
at
the
table
22
For
indeed
the
Son
of
man
is
going
his
way
according
to
what
has
been
determined
all
the
same
woe
to
that
man
through
whom
he
is
betrayed
23
So
they
began
to
discuss
among
themselves
which
one
of
them
could
really
be
about
to
do
this
24
However
there
also
arose
a
heated
dispute
among
them
over
which
one
of
them
was
considered
to
be
the
greatest
25
But
he
said
to
them
The
kings
of
the
nations
lord
it
over
them
and
those
having
authority
over
them
are
called
Benefactors
26
You
though
are
not
to
be
that
way
But
let
the
one
who
is
the
greatest
among
you
become
as
the
youngest
and
the
one
taking
the
lead
as
the
one
ministering
27
For
which
one
is
greater
the
one
dining
or
the
one
serving
Is
it
not
the
one
dining
But
I
am
among
you
as
the
one
serving
28
However
you
are
the
ones
who
have
stuck
with
me
in
my
trials
29
and
I
make
a
covenant
with
you
just
as
my
Father
has
made
a
covenant
with
me
for
a
kingdom
30
so
that
you
may
eat
and
drink
at
my
table
in
my
Kingdom
and
sit
on
thrones
to
judge
the
12
tribes
of
Israel
31
Simon
Simon
look
Satan
has
demanded
to
have
all
of
you
to
sift
you
as
wheat
32
But
I
have
made
supplication
for
you
that
your
faith
may
not
give
out
and
you
once
you
have
returned
strengthen
your
brothers
33
Then
he
said
to
him
Lord
I
am
ready
to
go
with
you
both
to
prison
and
to
death
34
But
he
said
I
tell
you
Peter
a
rooster
will
not
crow
today
until
you
have
denied
knowing
me
three
times
35
He
also
said
to
them
When
I
sent
you
out
without
a
money
bag
and
a
food
pouch
and
sandals
you
did
not
lack
anything
did
you
They
said
No
36
Then
he
said
to
them
But
now
let
the
one
who
has
a
money
bag
take
it
likewise
a
food
pouch
and
let
the
one
who
has
no
sword
sell
his
outer
garment
and
buy
one
37
For
I
tell
you
that
what
is
written
must
be
accomplished
in
me
namely
He
was
counted
with
lawless
ones
For
this
is
being
fulfilled
concerning
me
38
Then
they
said
Lord
look
here
are
two
swords
He
said
to
them
It
is
enough
39
On
leaving
he
went
as
was
his
custom
to
the
Mount
of
Olives
and
the
disciples
also
followed
him
40
On
arriving
at
the
place
he
said
to
them
Carry
on
prayer
so
that
you
do
not
enter
into
temptation
41
And
he
withdrew
from
them
about
a
stones
throw
away
and
he
bent
his
knees
and
began
to
pray
42
saying
Father
if
you
want
to
remove
this
cup
from
me
Nevertheless
let
not
my
will
but
yours
take
place
43
Then
an
angel
from
heaven
appeared
to
him
and
strengthened
him
44
But
he
was
in
such
agony
that
he
kept
praying
more
earnestly
and
his
sweat
became
as
drops
of
blood
falling
to
the
ground
45
When
he
rose
from
prayer
and
went
to
the
disciples
he
found
them
slumbering
exhausted
from
grief
46
He
said
to
them
Why
are
you
sleeping
Get
up
and
keep
praying
so
that
you
do
not
enter
into
temptation
47
While
he
was
still
speaking
look
a
crowd
and
the
man
called
Judas
one
of
the
Twelve
was
leading
them
and
he
approached
Jesus
to
kiss
him
48
But
Jesus
said
to
him
Judas
are
you
betraying
the
Son
of
man
with
a
kiss
49
When
those
around
him
saw
what
was
going
to
happen
they
said
Lord
should
we
strike
with
the
sword
50
One
of
them
even
struck
the
slave
of
the
high
priest
taking
off
his
right
ear
51
But
in
reply
Jesus
said
That
is
enough
And
he
touched
the
ear
and
healed
him
52
Jesus
then
said
to
the
chief
priests
and
captains
of
the
temple
and
elders
who
had
come
there
for
him
Did
you
come
out
with
swords
and
clubs
as
against
a
robber
53
While
I
was
with
you
in
the
temple
day
after
day
you
did
not
lay
your
hands
on
me
But
this
is
your
hour
and
the
authority
of
darkness
54
Then
they
arrested
him
and
led
him
off
and
they
brought
him
into
the
house
of
the
high
priest
but
Peter
was
following
at
a
distance
55
When
they
lit
a
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
and
sat
down
together
Peter
was
sitting
among
them
56
But
a
servant
girl
seeing
him
sitting
in
the
light
of
the
fire
looked
closely
at
him
and
said
This
man
was
also
with
him
57
But
he
denied
it
saying
I
do
not
know
him
woman
58
After
a
short
time
another
person
saw
him
and
said
You
too
are
one
of
them
But
Peter
said
Man
I
am
not
59
And
after
about
an
hour
had
passed
another
man
began
insisting
strongly
Certainly
this
man
was
also
with
him
for
he
is
in
fact
a
Galilean
60
But
Peter
said
Man
I
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
And
instantly
while
he
was
still
speaking
a
rooster
crowed
61
At
this
the
Lord
turned
and
looked
straight
at
Peter
and
Peter
recalled
the
statement
of
the
Lord
when
he
had
said
to
him
Before
a
rooster
crows
today
you
will
disown
me
three
times
62
And
he
went
outside
and
wept
bitterly
63
Now
the
men
who
held
Jesus
in
custody
began
to
mock
him
hitting
him
64
and
after
covering
his
face
they
kept
asking
Prophesy
Who
is
it
that
struck
you
65
And
they
said
many
other
blasphemous
things
against
him
66
And
when
it
became
day
the
assembly
of
elders
of
the
people
both
chief
priests
and
scribes
gathered
together
and
they
led
him
into
their
Sanhedrin
hall
and
said
67
If
you
are
the
Christ
tell
us
But
he
said
to
them
Even
if
I
told
you
you
would
not
believe
it
at
all
68
Moreover
if
I
questioned
you
you
would
not
answer
69
However
from
now
on
the
Son
of
man
will
be
seated
at
the
powerful
right
hand
of
God
70
At
this
they
all
said
Are
you
therefore
the
Son
of
God
He
said
to
them
You
yourselves
are
saying
that
I
am
71
They
said
Why
do
we
need
further
testimony
For
we
ourselves
have
heard
it
out
of
his
own
mouth
1
So
the
multitude
got
up
one
and
all
and
led
him
to
Pilate
2
Then
they
began
to
accuse
him
saying
We
found
this
man
subverting
our
nation
forbidding
the
paying
of
taxes
to
Caesar
and
saying
he
himself
is
Christ
a
king
3
Now
Pilate
asked
him
the
question
Are
you
the
King
of
the
Jews
In
answer
he
said
You
yourself
are
saying
it
4
Then
Pilate
said
to
the
chief
priests
and
the
crowds
I
find
no
crime
in
this
man
5
But
they
insisted
saying
He
stirs
up
the
people
by
teaching
throughout
all
Judea
starting
from
Galilee
even
to
here
6
On
hearing
that
Pilate
asked
whether
the
man
was
a
Galilean
7
After
ascertaining
that
he
was
under
the
jurisdiction
of
Herod
he
sent
him
on
to
Herod
who
was
also
in
Jerusalem
in
those
days
8
When
Herod
saw
Jesus
he
rejoiced
greatly
For
a
considerable
time
he
had
been
wanting
to
see
Jesus
because
he
had
heard
much
about
him
and
he
was
hoping
to
see
some
sign
performed
by
him
9
So
he
began
to
question
him
at
length
but
he
gave
him
no
answer
10
However
the
chief
priests
and
the
scribes
kept
standing
up
and
vehemently
accusing
him
11
Then
Herod
together
with
his
soldiers
treated
him
with
contempt
and
he
mocked
him
by
clothing
him
with
a
splendid
garment
and
then
sent
him
back
to
Pilate
12
Herod
and
Pilate
became
friends
with
each
other
on
that
very
day
for
before
that
they
had
been
at
enmity
with
each
other
13
Pilate
then
called
together
the
chief
priests
the
rulers
and
the
people
14
and
said
to
them
You
brought
this
man
to
me
as
one
inciting
the
people
to
revolt
Now
look
I
examined
him
in
front
of
you
but
found
in
this
man
no
grounds
for
the
charges
you
are
bringing
against
him
15
In
fact
neither
did
Herod
for
he
sent
him
back
to
us
and
look
he
has
done
nothing
deserving
of
death
16
I
will
therefore
punish
him
and
release
him
17
——
18
But
the
whole
crowd
shouted
out
Do
away
with
this
man
and
release
Barabbas
to
us
19
This
man
had
been
thrown
into
prison
for
sedition
that
had
occurred
in
the
city
and
for
murder
20
Again
Pilate
called
out
to
them
because
he
wanted
to
release
Jesus
21
Then
they
began
to
yell
saying
To
the
stake
with
him
To
the
stake
with
him
22
The
third
time
he
said
to
them
Why
What
bad
thing
did
this
man
do
I
found
in
him
nothing
deserving
of
death
I
will
therefore
punish
him
and
release
him
23
At
this
they
became
insistent
demanding
with
loud
voices
that
he
be
executed
and
their
voices
prevailed
24
So
Pilate
made
the
decision
that
their
demand
be
met
25
He
released
the
man
whom
they
were
demanding
who
had
been
thrown
into
prison
for
sedition
and
murder
but
he
surrendered
Jesus
to
their
will
26
Now
as
they
led
him
away
they
seized
a
certain
Simon
of
Cyrene
who
was
coming
from
the
countryside
and
they
placed
the
torture
stake
on
him
to
carry
it
behind
Jesus
27
A
large
number
of
people
were
following
him
including
women
who
kept
beating
themselves
in
grief
and
wailing
for
him
28
Jesus
turned
to
the
women
and
said
Daughters
of
Jerusalem
stop
weeping
for
me
Weep
instead
for
yourselves
and
for
your
children
29
for
look
days
are
coming
when
people
will
say
Happy
are
the
barren
women
the
wombs
that
did
not
give
birth
and
the
breasts
that
did
not
nurse
30
Then
they
will
start
saying
to
the
mountains
Fall
over
us
and
to
the
hills
Cover
us
over
31
If
they
do
these
things
when
the
tree
is
moist
what
will
occur
when
it
is
withered
32
Two
other
men
criminals
were
also
being
led
off
to
be
executed
with
him
33
And
when
they
got
to
the
place
called
Skull
they
nailed
him
to
the
stake
there
alongside
the
criminals
one
on
his
right
and
one
on
his
left
34
But
Jesus
was
saying
Father
forgive
them
for
they
do
not
know
what
they
are
doing
Furthermore
they
cast
lots
to
distribute
his
garments
35
And
the
people
stood
looking
on
But
the
rulers
were
sneering
and
saying
Others
he
saved
let
him
save
himself
if
he
is
the
Christ
of
God
the
Chosen
One
36
Even
the
soldiers
mocked
him
coming
up
and
offering
him
sour
wine
37
and
saying
If
you
are
the
King
of
the
Jews
save
yourself
38
There
was
also
an
inscription
over
him
This
is
the
King
of
the
Jews
39
Then
one
of
the
criminals
hanging
there
began
to
speak
abusively
to
him
saying
You
are
the
Christ
are
you
not
Save
yourself
and
us
too
40
In
response
the
other
rebuked
him
saying
Do
you
not
fear
God
at
all
now
that
you
have
received
the
same
judgment
41
And
we
rightly
so
for
we
are
getting
back
what
we
deserve
for
the
things
we
did
but
this
man
did
nothing
wrong
42
Then
he
said
Jesus
remember
me
when
you
get
into
your
Kingdom
43
And
he
said
to
him
Truly
I
tell
you
today
you
will
be
with
me
in
Paradise
44
Well
by
now
it
was
about
the
sixth
hour
and
yet
a
darkness
fell
over
all
the
land
until
the
ninth
hour
45
because
the
sunlight
failed
then
the
curtain
of
the
sanctuary
was
torn
down
the
middle
46
And
Jesus
called
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
Father
into
your
hands
I
entrust
my
spirit
After
he
said
this
he
expired
47
Because
of
seeing
what
occurred
the
army
officer
began
to
glorify
God
saying
Truly
this
man
was
righteous
48
And
when
all
the
crowds
that
were
gathered
together
there
for
this
spectacle
saw
the
things
that
occurred
they
returned
home
beating
their
chests
49
And
all
those
acquainted
with
him
were
standing
at
a
distance
Also
women
who
had
accompanied
him
from
Galilee
were
there
and
saw
these
things
50
And
look
there
was
a
man
named
Joseph
a
member
of
the
Council
who
was
a
good
and
righteous
man
51
This
man
had
not
voted
in
support
of
their
scheme
and
action
He
was
from
Arimathea
a
city
of
the
Judeans
and
was
waiting
for
the
Kingdom
of
God
52
This
man
went
in
before
Pilate
and
asked
for
the
body
of
Jesus
53
And
he
took
it
down
and
wrapped
it
up
in
fine
linen
and
he
laid
it
in
a
tomb
carved
in
the
rock
where
no
man
had
yet
lain
54
Now
it
was
the
day
of
Preparation
and
the
Sabbath
was
about
to
begin
55
But
the
women
who
had
come
with
him
from
Galilee
followed
along
and
took
a
look
at
the
tomb
and
saw
how
his
body
was
laid
56
and
they
went
back
to
prepare
spices
and
perfumed
oils
But
of
course
they
rested
on
the
Sabbath
according
to
the
commandment
1
But
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
they
came
very
early
to
the
tomb
bringing
the
spices
they
had
prepared
2
But
they
found
the
stone
rolled
away
from
the
tomb
3
and
when
they
entered
they
did
not
find
the
body
of
the
Lord
Jesus
4
While
they
were
perplexed
about
this
look
two
men
in
shining
garments
stood
by
them
5
The
women
became
frightened
and
kept
their
faces
turned
toward
the
ground
so
the
men
said
to
them
Why
are
you
looking
for
the
living
one
among
the
dead
6
He
is
not
here
but
has
been
raised
up
Recall
how
he
spoke
to
you
while
he
was
yet
in
Galilee
7
saying
that
the
Son
of
man
must
be
handed
over
to
sinful
men
and
be
executed
on
the
stake
and
on
the
third
day
rise
8
Then
they
remembered
his
words
9
and
they
returned
from
the
tomb
and
reported
all
these
things
to
the
Eleven
and
to
all
the
rest
10
They
were
Mary
Magdalene
Joanna
and
Mary
the
mother
of
James
Also
the
rest
of
the
women
with
them
were
telling
these
things
to
the
apostles
11
However
these
sayings
seemed
like
nonsense
to
them
and
they
would
not
believe
the
women
12
But
Peter
got
up
and
ran
to
the
tomb
and
stooping
forward
he
saw
only
the
linen
cloths
So
he
went
off
wondering
to
himself
what
had
occurred
13
But
look
on
that
very
day
two
of
them
were
traveling
to
a
village
named
Emmaus
about
seven
miles
from
Jerusalem
14
and
they
were
conversing
with
each
other
about
all
these
things
that
had
happened
15
Now
as
they
were
conversing
and
discussing
these
things
Jesus
himself
approached
and
began
walking
with
them
16
but
their
eyes
were
kept
from
recognizing
him
17
He
said
to
them
What
are
these
matters
that
you
are
debating
between
yourselves
as
you
walk
along
And
they
stood
still
looking
sad
18
In
answer
the
one
named
Cleopas
said
to
him
Are
you
a
stranger
dwelling
alone
in
Jerusalem
and
do
not
know
the
things
that
have
occurred
there
during
these
days
19
He
asked
them
What
things
They
said
to
him
The
things
concerning
Jesus
the
Nazarene
who
proved
to
be
a
prophet
powerful
in
deed
and
word
before
God
and
all
the
people
20
and
how
our
chief
priests
and
rulers
handed
him
over
to
be
sentenced
to
death
and
they
nailed
him
to
the
stake
21
But
we
were
hoping
that
this
man
was
the
one
who
was
going
to
deliver
Israel
Yes
and
besides
all
these
things
this
is
the
third
day
since
these
things
occurred
22
Moreover
some
women
from
among
us
also
astonished
us
for
they
went
early
to
the
tomb
23
and
when
they
did
not
find
his
body
they
came
saying
that
they
had
also
seen
a
supernatural
sight
of
angels
who
said
he
is
alive
24
Then
some
of
those
who
were
with
us
went
off
to
the
tomb
and
they
found
it
just
as
the
women
had
said
but
they
did
not
see
him
25
So
he
said
to
them
O
senseless
ones
and
slow
of
heart
to
believe
all
the
things
the
prophets
have
spoken
26
Was
it
not
necessary
for
the
Christ
to
suffer
these
things
and
to
enter
into
his
glory
27
And
starting
with
Moses
and
all
the
Prophets
he
interpreted
to
them
things
pertaining
to
himself
in
all
the
Scriptures
28
Finally
they
got
close
to
the
village
to
which
they
were
traveling
and
he
made
as
if
to
travel
on
farther
29
But
they
urged
him
to
remain
saying
Stay
with
us
because
it
is
almost
evening
and
the
day
is
nearly
over
With
that
he
went
in
to
stay
with
them
30
And
as
he
was
dining
with
them
he
took
the
bread
blessed
it
broke
it
and
began
handing
it
to
them
31
At
that
their
eyes
were
fully
opened
and
they
recognized
him
but
he
disappeared
from
them
32
And
they
said
to
each
other
Were
not
our
hearts
burning
within
us
as
he
was
speaking
to
us
on
the
road
as
he
was
fully
opening
up
the
Scriptures
to
us
33
And
they
got
up
in
that
very
hour
and
returned
to
Jerusalem
and
they
found
the
Eleven
and
those
assembled
together
with
them
34
who
said
For
a
fact
the
Lord
was
raised
up
and
he
appeared
to
Simon
35
Then
they
related
the
events
on
the
road
and
how
he
became
known
to
them
by
the
breaking
of
the
bread
36
While
they
were
speaking
of
these
things
he
himself
stood
in
their
midst
and
said
to
them
May
you
have
peace
37
But
because
they
were
terrified
and
frightened
they
imagined
that
they
were
seeing
a
spirit
38
So
he
said
to
them
Why
are
you
troubled
and
why
have
doubts
come
up
in
your
hearts
39
See
my
hands
and
my
feet
that
it
is
I
myself
touch
me
and
see
for
a
spirit
does
not
have
flesh
and
bones
just
as
you
see
that
I
have
40
And
as
he
said
this
he
showed
them
his
hands
and
his
feet
41
But
while
they
were
still
not
believing
for
sheer
joy
and
amazement
he
said
to
them
Do
you
have
something
there
to
eat
42
So
they
handed
him
a
piece
of
broiled
fish
43
and
he
took
it
and
ate
it
before
their
eyes
44
He
then
said
to
them
These
are
my
words
that
I
spoke
to
you
while
I
was
yet
with
you
that
all
the
things
written
about
me
in
the
Law
of
Moses
and
in
the
Prophets
and
Psalms
must
be
fulfilled
45
Then
he
opened
up
their
minds
fully
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
Scriptures
46
and
he
said
to
them
This
is
what
is
written
that
the
Christ
would
suffer
and
rise
from
among
the
dead
on
the
third
day
47
and
on
the
basis
of
his
name
repentance
for
forgiveness
of
sins
would
be
preached
in
all
the
nations—starting
out
from
Jerusalem
48
You
are
to
be
witnesses
of
these
things
49
And
look
I
am
sending
upon
you
what
my
Father
promised
You
though
stay
in
the
city
until
you
are
clothed
with
power
from
on
high
50
Then
he
led
them
out
as
far
as
Bethany
and
he
lifted
up
his
hands
and
blessed
them
51
As
he
was
blessing
them
he
was
parted
from
them
and
taken
up
to
heaven
52
And
they
did
obeisance
to
him
and
returned
to
Jerusalem
with
great
joy
53
And
they
were
continually
in
the
temple
praising
God
1
In
the
beginning
was
the
Word
and
the
Word
was
with
God
and
the
Word
was
a
god
2
This
one
was
in
the
beginning
with
God
3
All
things
came
into
existence
through
him
and
apart
from
him
not
even
one
thing
came
into
existence
What
has
come
into
existence
4
by
means
of
him
was
life
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
men
5
And
the
light
is
shining
in
the
darkness
but
the
darkness
has
not
overpowered
it
6
There
came
a
man
who
was
sent
as
a
representative
of
God
his
name
was
John
7
This
man
came
as
a
witness
in
order
to
bear
witness
about
the
light
so
that
people
of
all
sorts
might
believe
through
him
8
He
was
not
that
light
but
he
was
meant
to
bear
witness
about
that
light
9
The
true
light
that
gives
light
to
every
sort
of
man
was
about
to
come
into
the
world
10
He
was
in
the
world
and
the
world
came
into
existence
through
him
but
the
world
did
not
know
him
11
He
came
to
his
own
home
but
his
own
people
did
not
accept
him
12
However
to
all
who
did
receive
him
he
gave
authority
to
become
Gods
children
because
they
were
exercising
faith
in
his
name
13
And
they
were
born
not
from
blood
or
from
a
fleshly
will
or
from
mans
will
but
from
God
14
So
the
Word
became
flesh
and
resided
among
us
and
we
had
a
view
of
his
glory
a
glory
such
as
belongs
to
an
only-begotten
son
from
a
father
and
he
was
full
of
divine
favor
and
truth
15
John
bore
witness
about
him
yes
he
cried
out
This
was
the
one
of
whom
I
said
The
one
coming
behind
me
has
advanced
in
front
of
me
for
he
existed
before
me
16
For
we
all
received
from
his
fullness
even
undeserved
kindness
upon
undeserved
kindness
17
Because
the
Law
was
given
through
Moses
the
undeserved
kindness
and
the
truth
came
to
be
through
Jesus
Christ
18
No
man
has
seen
God
at
any
time
the
only-begotten
god
who
is
at
the
Fathers
side
is
the
one
who
has
explained
Him
19
This
is
the
witness
John
gave
when
the
Jews
sent
priests
and
Levites
from
Jerusalem
to
ask
him
Who
are
you
20
And
he
admitted
it
and
did
not
deny
it
saying
I
am
not
the
Christ
21
And
they
asked
him
What
then
Are
you
Elijah
He
replied
I
am
not
Are
you
the
Prophet
And
he
answered
No
22
So
they
said
to
him
Who
are
you
Tell
us
so
that
we
may
give
an
answer
to
those
who
sent
us
What
do
you
say
about
yourself
23
He
said
I
am
a
voice
of
someone
crying
out
in
the
wilderness
Make
the
way
of
Jehovah
straight

just
as
Isaiah
the
prophet
said
24
Now
those
sent
were
from
the
Pharisees
25
So
they
questioned
him
and
said
to
him
Why
then
do
you
baptize
if
you
are
not
the
Christ
or
Elijah
or
the
Prophet
26
John
answered
them
I
baptize
in
water
One
is
standing
among
you
whom
you
do
not
know
27
the
one
coming
behind
me
the
lace
of
whose
sandal
I
am
not
worthy
to
untie
28
These
things
took
place
in
Bethany
across
the
Jordan
where
John
was
baptizing
29
The
next
day
he
saw
Jesus
coming
toward
him
and
he
said
See
the
Lamb
of
God
who
takes
away
the
sin
of
the
world
30
This
is
the
one
about
whom
I
said
Behind
me
there
comes
a
man
who
has
advanced
in
front
of
me
for
he
existed
before
me
31
Even
I
did
not
know
him
but
the
reason
why
I
came
baptizing
in
water
was
so
that
he
might
be
made
manifest
to
Israel
32
John
also
bore
witness
saying
I
viewed
the
spirit
coming
down
as
a
dove
out
of
heaven
and
it
remained
upon
him
33
Even
I
did
not
know
him
but
the
very
One
who
sent
me
to
baptize
in
water
said
to
me
Whoever
it
is
upon
whom
you
see
the
spirit
coming
down
and
remaining
this
is
the
one
who
baptizes
in
holy
spirit
34
And
I
have
seen
it
and
I
have
given
witness
that
this
one
is
the
Son
of
God
35
Again
the
next
day
John
was
standing
with
two
of
his
disciples
36
and
as
he
looked
at
Jesus
walking
he
said
See
the
Lamb
of
God
37
When
the
two
disciples
heard
him
say
this
they
followed
Jesus
38
Then
Jesus
turned
and
seeing
them
following
he
said
to
them
What
are
you
looking
for
They
said
to
him
Rabbi
which
means
when
translated
Teacher
where
are
you
staying
39
He
said
to
them
Come
and
you
will
see
So
they
went
and
saw
where
he
was
staying
and
they
stayed
with
him
that
day
it
was
about
the
tenth
hour
40
Andrew
the
brother
of
Simon
Peter
was
one
of
the
two
who
heard
what
John
said
and
followed
Jesus
41
He
first
found
his
own
brother
Simon
and
said
to
him
We
have
found
the
Messiah
which
means
when
translated
Christ
42
and
he
led
him
to
Jesus
When
Jesus
looked
at
him
he
said
You
are
Simon
the
son
of
John
you
will
be
called
Cephas
which
is
translated
Peter
43
The
next
day
he
wanted
to
leave
for
Galilee
Jesus
then
found
Philip
and
said
to
him
Be
my
follower
44
Now
Philip
was
from
Bethsaida
from
the
city
of
Andrew
and
Peter
45
Philip
found
Nathanael
and
said
to
him
We
have
found
the
one
of
whom
Moses
in
the
Law
and
the
Prophets
wrote
Jesus
the
son
of
Joseph
from
Nazareth
46
But
Nathanael
said
to
him
Can
anything
good
come
out
of
Nazareth
Philip
said
to
him
Come
and
see
47
Jesus
saw
Nathanael
coming
toward
him
and
said
about
him
See
truly
an
Israelite
in
whom
there
is
no
deceit
48
Nathanael
said
to
him
How
do
you
know
me
Jesus
answered
him
Before
Philip
called
you
while
you
were
under
the
fig
tree
I
saw
you
49
Nathanael
responded
Rabbi
you
are
the
Son
of
God
you
are
King
of
Israel
50
Jesus
answered
him
Do
you
believe
because
I
told
you
I
saw
you
under
the
fig
tree
You
will
see
things
greater
than
these
51
He
then
said
to
him
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
men
you
will
see
heaven
opened
up
and
the
angels
of
God
ascending
and
descending
to
the
Son
of
man
1
And
on
the
third
day
a
marriage
feast
took
place
in
Cana
of
Galilee
and
the
mother
of
Jesus
was
there
2
Jesus
and
his
disciples
were
also
invited
to
the
marriage
feast
3
When
the
wine
ran
short
the
mother
of
Jesus
said
to
him
They
have
no
wine
4
But
Jesus
said
to
her
Woman
why
is
that
of
concern
to
me
and
to
you
My
hour
has
not
yet
come
5
His
mother
said
to
those
serving
Do
whatever
he
tells
you
6
Now
there
were
six
stone
water
jars
sitting
there
as
required
by
the
purification
rules
of
the
Jews
each
able
to
hold
two
or
three
liquid
measures
7
Jesus
said
to
them
Fill
the
jars
with
water
So
they
filled
them
to
the
brim
8
Then
he
said
to
them
Now
draw
some
out
and
take
it
to
the
director
of
the
feast
So
they
took
it
9
When
the
director
of
the
feast
tasted
the
water
that
had
now
been
turned
into
wine
not
knowing
where
it
came
from
although
the
servants
who
had
drawn
out
the
water
knew
the
director
of
the
feast
called
the
bridegroom
10
and
said
to
him
Everyone
else
puts
out
the
fine
wine
first
and
when
people
are
intoxicated
the
inferior
You
have
saved
the
fine
wine
until
now
11
Jesus
did
this
in
Cana
of
Galilee
as
the
beginning
of
his
signs
and
he
made
his
glory
manifest
and
his
disciples
put
their
faith
in
him
12
After
this
he
and
his
mother
and
his
brothers
and
his
disciples
went
down
to
Capernaum
but
they
did
not
stay
there
many
days
13
Now
the
Passover
of
the
Jews
was
near
and
Jesus
went
up
to
Jerusalem
14
He
found
in
the
temple
those
selling
cattle
and
sheep
and
doves
and
the
money
brokers
in
their
seats
15
So
after
making
a
whip
of
ropes
he
drove
all
those
with
the
sheep
and
cattle
out
of
the
temple
and
he
poured
out
the
coins
of
the
money
changers
and
overturned
their
tables
16
And
he
said
to
those
selling
the
doves
Take
these
things
away
from
here
Stop
making
the
house
of
my
Father
a
house
of
commerce
17
His
disciples
recalled
that
it
is
written
The
zeal
for
your
house
will
consume
me
18
Therefore
in
response
the
Jews
said
to
him
What
sign
can
you
show
us
since
you
are
doing
these
things
19
Jesus
replied
to
them
Tear
down
this
temple
and
in
three
days
I
will
raise
it
up
20
The
Jews
then
said
This
temple
was
built
in
46
years
and
will
you
raise
it
up
in
three
days
21
But
he
was
talking
about
the
temple
of
his
body
22
When
though
he
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
his
disciples
recalled
that
he
used
to
say
this
and
they
believed
the
scripture
and
what
Jesus
had
spoken
23
However
when
he
was
in
Jerusalem
at
the
festival
of
the
Passover
many
people
put
their
faith
in
his
name
when
they
saw
the
signs
that
he
was
performing
24
But
Jesus
would
not
entrust
himself
to
them
because
he
knew
them
all
25
and
because
he
did
not
need
to
have
anyone
bear
witness
about
man
for
he
knew
what
was
in
man
1
There
was
a
man
of
the
Pharisees
named
Nicodemus
a
ruler
of
the
Jews
2
This
one
came
to
him
in
the
night
and
said
to
him
Rabbi
we
know
that
you
have
come
from
God
as
a
teacher
for
no
one
can
perform
these
signs
that
you
perform
unless
God
is
with
him
3
In
response
Jesus
said
to
him
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
unless
anyone
is
born
again
he
cannot
see
the
Kingdom
of
God
4
Nicodemus
said
to
him
How
can
a
man
be
born
when
he
is
old
He
cannot
enter
into
the
womb
of
his
mother
a
second
time
and
be
born
can
he
5
Jesus
answered
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
unless
anyone
is
born
from
water
and
spirit
he
cannot
enter
into
the
Kingdom
of
God
6
What
has
been
born
from
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
what
has
been
born
from
the
spirit
is
spirit
7
Do
not
be
amazed
because
I
told
you
You
people
must
be
born
again
8
The
wind
blows
where
it
wants
to
and
you
hear
the
sound
of
it
but
you
do
not
know
where
it
comes
from
and
where
it
is
going
So
it
is
with
everyone
who
has
been
born
from
the
spirit
9
In
answer
Nicodemus
said
to
him
How
can
these
things
be
10
Jesus
replied
Are
you
a
teacher
of
Israel
and
yet
do
not
know
these
things
11
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
what
we
know
we
speak
and
what
we
have
seen
we
bear
witness
to
but
you
do
not
receive
the
witness
we
give
12
If
I
have
told
you
earthly
things
and
you
still
do
not
believe
how
will
you
believe
if
I
tell
you
heavenly
things
13
Moreover
no
man
has
ascended
into
heaven
but
the
one
who
descended
from
heaven
the
Son
of
man
14
And
just
as
Moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
so
the
Son
of
man
must
be
lifted
up
15
so
that
everyone
believing
in
him
may
have
everlasting
life
16
For
God
loved
the
world
so
much
that
he
gave
his
only-begotten
Son
so
that
everyone
exercising
faith
in
him
might
not
be
destroyed
but
have
everlasting
life
17
For
God
did
not
send
his
Son
into
the
world
for
him
to
judge
the
world
but
for
the
world
to
be
saved
through
him
18
Whoever
exercises
faith
in
him
is
not
to
be
judged
Whoever
does
not
exercise
faith
has
been
judged
already
because
he
has
not
exercised
faith
in
the
name
of
the
only-begotten
Son
of
God
19
Now
this
is
the
basis
for
judgment
that
the
light
has
come
into
the
world
but
men
have
loved
the
darkness
rather
than
the
light
for
their
works
were
wicked
20
For
whoever
practices
vile
things
hates
the
light
and
does
not
come
to
the
light
so
that
his
works
may
not
be
reproved
21
But
whoever
does
what
is
true
comes
to
the
light
so
that
his
works
may
be
made
manifest
as
having
been
done
in
harmony
with
God
22
After
this
Jesus
and
his
disciples
went
into
the
Judean
countryside
and
there
he
spent
some
time
with
them
and
was
baptizing
23
But
John
too
was
baptizing
in
Aenon
near
Salim
because
there
was
a
great
quantity
of
water
there
and
people
kept
coming
and
were
being
baptized
24
for
John
had
not
yet
been
thrown
into
prison
25
Now
the
disciples
of
John
had
a
dispute
with
a
Jew
concerning
purification
26
So
they
came
to
John
and
said
to
him
Rabbi
the
man
who
was
with
you
across
the
Jordan
about
whom
you
bore
witness
see
this
one
is
baptizing
and
all
are
going
to
him
27
In
answer
John
said
A
man
cannot
receive
a
single
thing
unless
it
has
been
given
him
from
heaven
28
You
yourselves
bear
me
witness
that
I
said
I
am
not
the
Christ
but
I
have
been
sent
ahead
of
that
one
29
Whoever
has
the
bride
is
the
bridegroom
But
the
friend
of
the
bridegroom
when
he
stands
and
hears
him
has
a
great
deal
of
joy
on
account
of
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
So
my
joy
has
been
made
complete
30
That
one
must
keep
on
increasing
but
I
must
keep
on
decreasing
31
The
one
who
comes
from
above
is
over
all
others
The
one
who
is
from
the
earth
is
from
the
earth
and
speaks
of
things
of
the
earth
The
one
who
comes
from
heaven
is
over
all
others
32
He
bears
witness
to
what
he
has
seen
and
heard
but
no
man
accepts
his
witness
33
Whoever
has
accepted
his
witness
has
put
his
seal
to
it
that
God
is
true
34
For
the
one
whom
God
sent
speaks
the
sayings
of
God
for
He
does
not
give
the
spirit
sparingly
35
The
Father
loves
the
Son
and
has
given
all
things
into
his
hand
36
The
one
who
exercises
faith
in
the
Son
has
everlasting
life
the
one
who
disobeys
the
Son
will
not
see
life
but
the
wrath
of
God
remains
upon
him
1
When
the
Lord
became
aware
that
the
Pharisees
had
heard
that
Jesus
was
making
and
baptizing
more
disciples
than
John—
2
although
Jesus
himself
did
no
baptizing
but
his
disciples
did—
3
he
left
Judea
and
departed
again
for
Galilee
4
But
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
go
through
Samaria
5
So
he
came
to
a
city
of
Samaria
called
Sychar
near
the
field
that
Jacob
had
given
to
his
son
Joseph
6
In
fact
Jacobs
well
was
there
Now
Jesus
tired
out
as
he
was
from
the
journey
was
sitting
at
the
well
It
was
about
the
sixth
hour
7
A
woman
of
Samaria
came
to
draw
water
Jesus
said
to
her
Give
me
a
drink
8
For
his
disciples
had
gone
off
into
the
city
to
buy
food
9
So
the
Samaritan
woman
said
to
him
How
is
it
that
you
despite
being
a
Jew
ask
me
for
a
drink
even
though
I
am
a
Samaritan
woman
For
Jews
have
no
dealings
with
Samaritans
10
In
answer
Jesus
said
to
her
If
you
had
known
of
the
free
gift
of
God
and
who
it
is
who
says
to
you
Give
me
a
drink

you
would
have
asked
him
and
he
would
have
given
you
living
water
11
She
said
to
him
Sir
you
do
not
even
have
a
bucket
for
drawing
water
and
the
well
is
deep
From
what
source
then
do
you
have
this
living
water
12
You
are
not
greater
than
our
forefather
Jacob
who
gave
us
the
well
and
who
together
with
his
sons
and
his
cattle
drank
out
of
it
are
you
13
In
answer
Jesus
said
to
her
Everyone
drinking
from
this
water
will
get
thirsty
again
14
Whoever
drinks
from
the
water
that
I
will
give
him
will
never
get
thirsty
at
all
but
the
water
that
I
will
give
him
will
become
in
him
a
spring
of
water
bubbling
up
to
impart
everlasting
life
15
The
woman
said
to
him
Sir
give
me
this
water
so
that
I
may
neither
thirst
nor
keep
coming
over
to
this
place
to
draw
water
16
He
said
to
her
Go
call
your
husband
and
come
to
this
place
17
The
woman
replied
I
do
not
have
a
husband
Jesus
said
to
her
You
are
right
in
saying
I
do
not
have
a
husband
18
For
you
have
had
five
husbands
and
the
man
you
now
have
is
not
your
husband
This
you
have
said
truthfully
19
The
woman
said
to
him
Sir
I
see
that
you
are
a
prophet
20
Our
forefathers
worshipped
on
this
mountain
but
you
people
say
that
in
Jerusalem
is
the
place
where
people
must
worship
21
Jesus
said
to
her
Believe
me
woman
the
hour
is
coming
when
neither
on
this
mountain
nor
in
Jerusalem
will
you
worship
the
Father
22
You
worship
what
you
do
not
know
we
worship
what
we
know
because
salvation
begins
with
the
Jews
23
Nevertheless
the
hour
is
coming
and
it
is
now
when
the
true
worshippers
will
worship
the
Father
with
spirit
and
truth
for
indeed
the
Father
is
looking
for
ones
like
these
to
worship
him
24
God
is
a
Spirit
and
those
worshipping
him
must
worship
with
spirit
and
truth
25
The
woman
said
to
him
I
know
that
Messiah
is
coming
who
is
called
Christ
Whenever
that
one
comes
he
will
declare
all
things
to
us
openly
26
Jesus
said
to
her
I
am
he
the
one
speaking
to
you
27
Just
then
his
disciples
arrived
and
they
were
surprised
because
he
was
speaking
with
a
woman
Of
course
no
one
said
What
are
you
looking
for
or
Why
are
you
talking
to
her
28
So
the
woman
left
her
water
jar
and
went
off
into
the
city
and
told
the
people
29
Come
and
see
a
man
who
told
me
everything
I
did
Could
this
not
perhaps
be
the
Christ
30
They
left
the
city
and
began
coming
to
him
31
Meanwhile
the
disciples
were
urging
him
Rabbi
eat
32
But
he
said
to
them
I
have
food
to
eat
that
you
do
not
know
about
33
So
the
disciples
said
to
one
another
No
one
brought
him
anything
to
eat
did
he
34
Jesus
said
to
them
My
food
is
to
do
the
will
of
him
who
sent
me
and
to
finish
his
work
35
Do
you
not
say
that
there
are
yet
four
months
before
the
harvest
comes
Look
I
say
to
you
Lift
up
your
eyes
and
view
the
fields
that
they
are
white
for
harvesting
Already
36
the
reaper
is
receiving
wages
and
gathering
fruit
for
everlasting
life
so
that
the
sower
and
the
reaper
may
rejoice
together
37
For
in
this
respect
the
saying
is
true
One
is
the
sower
and
another
the
reaper
38
I
sent
you
to
reap
what
you
did
not
labor
on
Others
have
labored
and
you
have
entered
into
the
benefit
of
their
labor
39
Many
of
the
Samaritans
from
that
city
put
faith
in
him
because
of
the
word
of
the
woman
who
bore
witness
saying
He
told
me
all
the
things
I
did
40
So
when
the
Samaritans
came
to
him
they
asked
him
to
stay
with
them
and
he
stayed
there
two
days
41
As
a
result
many
more
believed
because
of
what
he
said
42
and
they
said
to
the
woman
We
no
longer
believe
just
because
of
what
you
said
for
we
have
heard
for
ourselves
and
we
know
that
this
man
really
is
the
savior
of
the
world
43
After
the
two
days
he
left
there
for
Galilee
44
Jesus
himself
however
bore
witness
that
a
prophet
has
no
honor
in
his
own
homeland
45
So
when
he
arrived
in
Galilee
the
Galileans
welcomed
him
because
they
had
seen
all
the
things
he
did
in
Jerusalem
at
the
festival
for
they
too
had
gone
to
the
festival
46
Then
he
came
again
to
Cana
of
Galilee
where
he
had
turned
the
water
into
wine
Now
there
was
a
royal
official
whose
son
was
sick
in
Capernaum
47
When
this
man
heard
that
Jesus
had
come
out
of
Judea
into
Galilee
he
went
to
him
and
asked
him
to
come
down
and
heal
his
son
for
he
was
at
the
point
of
dying
48
But
Jesus
said
to
him
Unless
you
people
see
signs
and
wonders
you
will
never
believe
49
The
royal
official
said
to
him
Lord
come
down
before
my
young
child
dies
50
Jesus
said
to
him
Go
your
way
your
son
lives
The
man
believed
the
word
that
Jesus
spoke
to
him
and
he
left
51
But
while
he
was
on
his
way
down
his
slaves
met
him
to
say
that
his
boy
was
alive
52
So
he
asked
them
at
what
hour
he
got
better
They
replied
to
him
The
fever
left
him
yesterday
at
the
seventh
hour
53
The
father
then
knew
that
it
was
in
the
very
hour
that
Jesus
had
said
to
him
Your
son
lives
So
he
and
his
whole
household
believed
54
This
was
the
second
sign
Jesus
performed
when
he
came
from
Judea
into
Galilee
1
After
this
there
was
a
festival
of
the
Jews
and
Jesus
went
up
to
Jerusalem
2
Now
in
Jerusalem
at
the
Sheep
Gate
is
a
pool
called
in
Hebrew
Bethzatha
with
five
colonnades
3
Within
these
a
multitude
of
the
sick
blind
lame
and
those
with
withered
limbs
were
lying
down
4
——
5
But
one
man
was
there
who
had
been
sick
for
38
years
6
Seeing
this
man
lying
there
and
being
aware
that
he
had
already
been
sick
for
a
long
time
Jesus
said
to
him
Do
you
want
to
get
well
7
The
sick
man
answered
him
Sir
I
do
not
have
anyone
to
put
me
into
the
pool
when
the
water
is
stirred
up
but
while
I
am
on
my
way
another
steps
down
ahead
of
me
8
Jesus
said
to
him
Get
up
Pick
up
your
mat
and
walk
9
And
the
man
immediately
got
well
and
he
picked
up
his
mat
and
began
to
walk
That
day
was
the
Sabbath
10
So
the
Jews
began
to
say
to
the
cured
man
It
is
the
Sabbath
and
it
is
not
lawful
for
you
to
carry
the
mat
11
But
he
answered
them
The
same
one
who
made
me
well
said
to
me
Pick
up
your
mat
and
walk
12
They
asked
him
Who
is
the
man
who
told
you
Pick
it
up
and
walk
13
But
the
healed
man
did
not
know
who
he
was
for
Jesus
had
slipped
away
into
the
crowd
that
was
there
14
After
this
Jesus
found
him
in
the
temple
and
said
to
him
See
you
have
become
well
Do
not
sin
anymore
so
that
something
worse
does
not
happen
to
you
15
The
man
went
away
and
told
the
Jews
that
it
was
Jesus
who
had
made
him
well
16
For
this
reason
the
Jews
were
persecuting
Jesus
because
he
was
doing
these
things
during
the
Sabbath
17
But
he
answered
them
My
Father
has
kept
working
until
now
and
I
keep
working
18
This
is
why
the
Jews
began
seeking
all
the
more
to
kill
him
because
not
only
was
he
breaking
the
Sabbath
but
he
was
also
calling
God
his
own
Father
making
himself
equal
to
God
19
Therefore
in
response
Jesus
said
to
them
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
the
Son
cannot
do
a
single
thing
of
his
own
initiative
but
only
what
he
sees
the
Father
doing
For
whatever
things
that
One
does
these
things
the
Son
does
also
in
like
manner
20
For
the
Father
has
affection
for
the
Son
and
shows
him
all
the
things
he
himself
does
and
he
will
show
him
works
greater
than
these
so
that
you
may
marvel
21
For
just
as
the
Father
raises
the
dead
up
and
makes
them
alive
so
the
Son
also
makes
alive
whomever
he
wants
to
22
For
the
Father
judges
no
one
at
all
but
he
has
entrusted
all
the
judging
to
the
Son
23
so
that
all
may
honor
the
Son
just
as
they
honor
the
Father
Whoever
does
not
honor
the
Son
does
not
honor
the
Father
who
sent
him
24
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
whoever
hears
my
word
and
believes
the
One
who
sent
me
has
everlasting
life
and
he
does
not
come
into
judgment
but
has
passed
over
from
death
to
life
25
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
the
hour
is
coming
and
it
is
now
when
the
dead
will
hear
the
voice
of
the
Son
of
God
and
those
who
have
paid
attention
will
live
26
For
just
as
the
Father
has
life
in
himself
so
he
has
granted
also
to
the
Son
to
have
life
in
himself
27
And
he
has
given
him
authority
to
do
judging
because
he
is
the
Son
of
man
28
Do
not
be
amazed
at
this
for
the
hour
is
coming
in
which
all
those
in
the
memorial
tombs
will
hear
his
voice
29
and
come
out
those
who
did
good
things
to
a
resurrection
of
life
and
those
who
practiced
vile
things
to
a
resurrection
of
judgment
30
I
cannot
do
a
single
thing
of
my
own
initiative
Just
as
I
hear
I
judge
and
my
judgment
is
righteous
because
I
seek
not
my
own
will
but
the
will
of
him
who
sent
me
31
If
I
alone
bear
witness
about
myself
my
witness
is
not
true
32
There
is
another
who
bears
witness
about
me
and
I
know
that
the
witness
he
bears
about
me
is
true
33
You
have
sent
men
to
John
and
he
has
borne
witness
to
the
truth
34
However
I
do
not
accept
the
witness
from
man
but
I
say
these
things
so
that
you
may
be
saved
35
That
man
was
a
burning
and
shining
lamp
and
for
a
short
time
you
were
willing
to
rejoice
greatly
in
his
light
36
But
I
have
the
witness
greater
than
that
of
John
for
the
very
works
that
my
Father
assigned
me
to
accomplish
these
works
that
I
am
doing
bear
witness
that
the
Father
sent
me
37
And
the
Father
who
sent
me
has
himself
borne
witness
about
me
You
have
neither
heard
his
voice
at
any
time
nor
seen
his
form
38
and
you
do
not
have
his
word
residing
in
you
because
you
do
not
believe
the
very
one
whom
he
sent
39
You
are
searching
the
Scriptures
because
you
think
that
you
will
have
everlasting
life
by
means
of
them
and
these
are
the
very
ones
that
bear
witness
about
me
40
And
yet
you
do
not
want
to
come
to
me
so
that
you
may
have
life
41
I
do
not
accept
glory
from
men
42
but
I
well
know
that
you
do
not
have
the
love
of
God
in
you
43
I
have
come
in
the
name
of
my
Father
but
you
do
not
receive
me
If
someone
else
came
in
his
own
name
you
would
receive
that
one
44
How
can
you
believe
when
you
are
accepting
glory
from
one
another
and
you
are
not
seeking
the
glory
that
is
from
the
only
God
45
Do
not
think
that
I
will
accuse
you
to
the
Father
there
is
one
who
accuses
you
Moses
in
whom
you
have
put
your
hope
46
In
fact
if
you
believed
Moses
you
would
believe
me
for
he
wrote
about
me
47
But
if
you
do
not
believe
his
writings
how
will
you
believe
what
I
say
1
After
this
Jesus
set
out
across
the
Sea
of
Galilee
or
Tiberias
2
And
a
large
crowd
kept
following
him
because
they
were
observing
the
miraculous
signs
he
was
performing
in
healing
the
sick
3
So
Jesus
went
up
on
a
mountain
and
sat
down
there
with
his
disciples
4
Now
the
Passover
the
festival
of
the
Jews
was
near
5
When
Jesus
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
that
a
large
crowd
was
coming
to
him
he
said
to
Philip
Where
will
we
buy
bread
for
these
people
to
eat
6
However
he
was
saying
this
to
test
him
for
he
knew
what
he
was
about
to
do
7
Philip
answered
him
Two
hundred
denarii
worth
of
bread
is
not
enough
for
each
of
them
to
get
even
a
little
8
One
of
his
disciples
Andrew
Simon
Peters
brother
said
to
him
9
Here
is
a
little
boy
who
has
five
barley
loaves
and
two
small
fish
But
what
are
these
among
so
many
10
Jesus
said
Have
the
men
sit
down
As
there
was
a
lot
of
grass
in
that
place
the
men
sat
down
there
about
5000
in
number
11
Jesus
took
the
bread
and
after
giving
thanks
he
distributed
it
to
those
who
were
sitting
there
he
did
likewise
with
the
small
fish
and
they
had
as
much
as
they
wanted
12
But
when
they
had
eaten
their
fill
he
said
to
his
disciples
Gather
together
the
fragments
left
over
so
that
nothing
is
wasted
13
So
they
gathered
them
together
and
filled
12
baskets
with
fragments
left
over
by
those
who
had
eaten
from
the
five
barley
loaves
14
When
the
people
saw
the
sign
he
performed
they
began
to
say
This
really
is
the
Prophet
who
was
to
come
into
the
world
15
Then
Jesus
knowing
that
they
were
about
to
come
and
seize
him
to
make
him
king
withdrew
again
to
the
mountain
all
alone
16
When
evening
fell
his
disciples
went
down
to
the
sea
17
and
boarding
a
boat
they
set
out
across
the
sea
for
Capernaum
By
now
it
had
grown
dark
and
Jesus
had
not
yet
come
to
them
18
Also
the
sea
was
getting
rough
because
a
strong
wind
was
blowing
19
However
when
they
had
rowed
about
three
or
four
miles
they
saw
Jesus
walking
on
the
sea
and
getting
near
the
boat
and
they
became
fearful
20
But
he
said
to
them
It
is
I
do
not
be
afraid
21
Then
they
were
willing
to
take
him
into
the
boat
and
right
away
the
boat
arrived
at
the
land
to
which
they
had
been
heading
22
The
next
day
the
crowd
that
had
stayed
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
saw
that
there
was
no
other
boat
there
except
a
small
one
and
that
Jesus
had
not
boarded
the
boat
with
his
disciples
but
his
disciples
had
left
by
themselves
23
Boats
from
Tiberias
however
arrived
near
the
place
where
they
ate
the
bread
after
the
Lord
had
given
thanks
24
So
when
the
crowd
saw
that
neither
Jesus
nor
his
disciples
were
there
they
boarded
their
boats
and
came
to
Capernaum
to
look
for
Jesus
25
When
they
found
him
across
the
sea
they
said
to
him
Rabbi
when
did
you
get
here
26
Jesus
answered
them
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
you
are
looking
for
me
not
because
you
saw
signs
but
because
you
ate
from
the
loaves
and
were
satisfied
27
Work
not
for
the
food
that
perishes
but
for
the
food
that
remains
for
everlasting
life
which
the
Son
of
man
will
give
you
for
on
this
one
the
Father
God
himself
has
put
his
seal
of
approval
28
So
they
said
to
him
What
must
we
do
to
carry
out
the
works
of
God
29
In
answer
Jesus
said
to
them
This
is
the
work
of
God
that
you
exercise
faith
in
the
one
whom
he
sent
30
Then
they
said
to
him
What
are
you
performing
as
a
sign
so
that
we
may
see
it
and
believe
you
What
work
are
you
doing
31
Our
forefathers
ate
the
manna
in
the
wilderness
just
as
it
is
written
He
gave
them
bread
from
heaven
to
eat
32
Jesus
then
said
to
them
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
Moses
did
not
give
you
the
bread
from
heaven
but
my
Father
gives
you
the
true
bread
from
heaven
33
For
the
bread
of
God
is
the
one
who
comes
down
from
heaven
and
gives
life
to
the
world
34
So
they
said
to
him
Lord
always
give
us
this
bread
35
Jesus
said
to
them
I
am
the
bread
of
life
Whoever
comes
to
me
will
not
get
hungry
at
all
and
whoever
exercises
faith
in
me
will
never
get
thirsty
at
all
36
But
as
I
said
to
you
you
have
even
seen
me
and
yet
do
not
believe
37
All
those
whom
the
Father
gives
me
will
come
to
me
and
I
will
never
drive
away
the
one
who
comes
to
me
38
for
I
have
come
down
from
heaven
to
do
not
my
own
will
but
the
will
of
him
who
sent
me
39
This
is
the
will
of
him
who
sent
me
that
I
should
lose
none
out
of
all
those
whom
he
has
given
me
but
that
I
should
resurrect
them
on
the
last
day
40
For
this
is
the
will
of
my
Father
that
everyone
who
recognizes
the
Son
and
exercises
faith
in
him
should
have
everlasting
life
and
I
will
resurrect
him
on
the
last
day
41
Then
the
Jews
began
to
murmur
about
him
because
he
had
said
I
am
the
bread
that
came
down
from
heaven
42
And
they
began
saying
Is
this
not
Jesus
the
son
of
Joseph
whose
father
and
mother
we
know
How
does
he
now
say
I
have
come
down
from
heaven
43
In
response
Jesus
said
to
them
Stop
murmuring
among
yourselves
44
No
man
can
come
to
me
unless
the
Father
who
sent
me
draws
him
and
I
will
resurrect
him
on
the
last
day
45
It
is
written
in
the
Prophets
They
will
all
be
taught
by
Jehovah
Everyone
who
has
listened
to
the
Father
and
has
learned
comes
to
me
46
Not
that
any
man
has
seen
the
Father
except
the
one
who
is
from
God
this
one
has
seen
the
Father
47
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
whoever
believes
has
everlasting
life
48
I
am
the
bread
of
life
49
Your
forefathers
ate
the
manna
in
the
wilderness
and
yet
they
died
50
This
is
the
bread
that
comes
down
from
heaven
so
that
anyone
may
eat
of
it
and
not
die
51
I
am
the
living
bread
that
came
down
from
heaven
If
anyone
eats
of
this
bread
he
will
live
forever
and
for
a
fact
the
bread
that
I
will
give
is
my
flesh
in
behalf
of
the
life
of
the
world
52
Then
the
Jews
began
to
argue
with
one
another
saying
How
can
this
man
give
us
his
flesh
to
eat
53
So
Jesus
said
to
them
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
unless
you
eat
the
flesh
of
the
Son
of
man
and
drink
his
blood
you
have
no
life
in
yourselves
54
Whoever
feeds
on
my
flesh
and
drinks
my
blood
has
everlasting
life
and
I
will
resurrect
him
on
the
last
day
55
for
my
flesh
is
true
food
and
my
blood
is
true
drink
56
Whoever
feeds
on
my
flesh
and
drinks
my
blood
remains
in
union
with
me
and
I
in
union
with
him
57
Just
as
the
living
Father
sent
me
and
I
live
because
of
the
Father
so
also
the
one
who
feeds
on
me
will
live
because
of
me
58
This
is
the
bread
that
came
down
from
heaven
It
is
not
as
when
your
forefathers
ate
and
yet
died
Whoever
feeds
on
this
bread
will
live
forever
59
He
said
these
things
as
he
was
teaching
in
a
synagogue
in
Capernaum
60
When
they
heard
this
many
of
his
disciples
said
This
speech
is
shocking
who
can
listen
to
it
61
But
Jesus
knowing
in
himself
that
his
disciples
were
murmuring
about
this
said
to
them
Does
this
stumble
you
62
What
therefore
if
you
should
see
the
Son
of
man
ascending
to
where
he
was
before
63
It
is
the
spirit
that
is
life-giving
the
flesh
is
of
no
use
at
all
The
sayings
that
I
have
spoken
to
you
are
spirit
and
are
life
64
But
there
are
some
of
you
who
do
not
believe
For
Jesus
knew
from
the
beginning
those
who
did
not
believe
and
the
one
who
would
betray
him
65
He
went
on
to
say
This
is
why
I
have
said
to
you
no
one
can
come
to
me
unless
it
is
granted
him
by
the
Father
66
Because
of
this
many
of
his
disciples
went
off
to
the
things
behind
and
would
no
longer
walk
with
him
67
So
Jesus
said
to
the
Twelve
You
do
not
want
to
go
also
do
you
68
Simon
Peter
answered
him
Lord
whom
shall
we
go
away
to
You
have
sayings
of
everlasting
life
69
We
have
believed
and
have
come
to
know
that
you
are
the
Holy
One
of
God
70
Jesus
answered
them
I
chose
you
twelve
did
I
not
Yet
one
of
you
is
a
slanderer
71
He
was
in
fact
speaking
of
Judas
the
son
of
Simon
Iscariot
for
this
one
was
going
to
betray
him
although
he
was
one
of
the
Twelve
1
After
this
Jesus
continued
traveling
about
in
Galilee
for
he
did
not
want
to
do
so
in
Judea
because
the
Jews
were
seeking
to
kill
him
2
However
the
Jewish
Festival
of
Tabernacles
was
near
3
So
his
brothers
said
to
him
Leave
here
and
go
into
Judea
so
that
your
disciples
may
also
see
the
works
you
are
doing
4
For
no
one
does
anything
in
secret
when
he
seeks
to
be
known
publicly
If
you
are
doing
these
things
show
yourself
to
the
world
5
His
brothers
were
in
fact
not
exercising
faith
in
him
6
So
Jesus
said
to
them
My
time
has
not
yet
arrived
but
your
time
is
always
at
hand
7
The
world
has
no
reason
to
hate
you
but
it
hates
me
because
I
bear
witness
about
it
that
its
works
are
wicked
8
You
go
up
to
the
festival
I
am
not
yet
going
up
to
this
festival
because
my
time
has
not
yet
fully
come
9
So
after
he
told
them
these
things
he
remained
in
Galilee
10
But
when
his
brothers
had
gone
up
to
the
festival
then
he
also
went
up
not
openly
but
in
secret
11
So
the
Jews
began
looking
for
him
at
the
festival
and
saying
Where
is
that
man
12
And
there
was
a
lot
of
subdued
talk
about
him
among
the
crowds
Some
would
say
He
is
a
good
man
Others
would
say
He
is
not
He
misleads
the
crowd
13
Of
course
no
one
would
speak
about
him
publicly
because
of
fear
of
the
Jews
14
When
the
festival
was
half
over
Jesus
went
up
into
the
temple
and
began
teaching
15
And
the
Jews
were
astonished
saying
How
does
this
man
have
such
a
knowledge
of
the
Scriptures
when
he
has
not
studied
at
the
schools
16
Jesus
in
turn
answered
them
and
said
What
I
teach
is
not
mine
but
belongs
to
him
who
sent
me
17
If
anyone
desires
to
do
His
will
he
will
know
whether
the
teaching
is
from
God
or
I
speak
of
my
own
originality
18
Whoever
speaks
of
his
own
originality
is
seeking
his
own
glory
but
whoever
seeks
the
glory
of
the
one
who
sent
him
this
one
is
true
and
there
is
no
unrighteousness
in
him
19
Moses
gave
you
the
Law
did
he
not
But
not
one
of
you
obeys
the
Law
Why
are
you
seeking
to
kill
me
20
The
crowd
answered
You
have
a
demon
Who
is
seeking
to
kill
you
21
In
answer
Jesus
said
to
them
One
deed
I
performed
and
you
are
all
surprised
22
For
this
reason
Moses
has
given
you
circumcision—not
that
it
is
from
Moses
but
it
is
from
the
forefathers—and
you
circumcise
a
man
on
a
sabbath
23
If
a
man
receives
circumcision
on
a
sabbath
so
that
the
Law
of
Moses
may
not
be
broken
are
you
violently
angry
at
me
because
I
made
a
man
completely
well
on
a
sabbath
24
Stop
judging
by
the
outward
appearance
but
judge
with
righteous
judgment
25
Then
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
began
to
say
This
is
the
man
they
are
seeking
to
kill
is
it
not
26
And
yet
see
he
is
speaking
in
public
and
they
say
nothing
to
him
Have
the
rulers
come
to
know
for
certain
that
this
is
the
Christ
27
On
the
contrary
we
know
where
this
man
is
from
yet
when
the
Christ
comes
no
one
is
to
know
where
he
is
from
28
Then
as
he
was
teaching
in
the
temple
Jesus
called
out
You
know
me
and
you
know
where
I
am
from
And
I
have
not
come
of
my
own
initiative
but
the
One
who
sent
me
is
real
and
you
do
not
know
him
29
I
know
him
because
I
am
a
representative
from
him
and
that
One
sent
me
30
So
they
began
seeking
to
get
hold
of
him
but
no
one
laid
a
hand
on
him
for
his
hour
had
not
yet
come
31
Still
many
of
the
crowd
put
faith
in
him
and
they
were
saying
When
the
Christ
comes
he
will
not
perform
more
signs
than
this
man
has
done
will
he
32
The
Pharisees
heard
the
crowd
murmuring
these
things
about
him
and
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
sent
officers
to
seize
him
33
Jesus
then
said
I
will
be
with
you
a
little
while
longer
before
I
go
to
the
One
who
sent
me
34
You
will
look
for
me
but
you
will
not
find
me
and
where
I
am
you
cannot
come
35
Therefore
the
Jews
said
among
themselves
Where
does
this
man
intend
to
go
so
that
we
will
not
find
him
He
does
not
intend
to
go
to
the
Jews
dispersed
among
the
Greeks
and
teach
the
Greeks
does
he
36
What
does
he
mean
when
he
says
You
will
look
for
me
but
you
will
not
find
me
and
where
I
am
you
cannot
come
37
On
the
last
day
the
great
day
of
the
festival
Jesus
stood
up
and
he
called
out
If
anyone
is
thirsty
let
him
come
to
me
and
drink
38
Whoever
puts
faith
in
me
just
as
the
scripture
has
said
From
deep
within
him
streams
of
living
water
will
flow
39
However
he
said
this
concerning
the
spirit
which
those
who
put
faith
in
him
were
about
to
receive
for
as
yet
there
was
no
spirit
because
Jesus
had
not
yet
been
glorified
40
Some
in
the
crowd
who
heard
these
words
began
saying
This
really
is
the
Prophet
41
Others
were
saying
This
is
the
Christ
But
some
were
saying
The
Christ
is
not
coming
out
of
Galilee
is
he
42
Does
the
scripture
not
say
that
the
Christ
is
coming
from
the
offspring
of
David
and
from
Bethlehem
the
village
where
David
was
43
So
a
division
over
him
arose
among
the
crowd
44
Some
of
them
though
wanted
to
seize
him
but
no
one
laid
his
hands
on
him
45
Then
the
officers
went
back
to
the
chief
priests
and
Pharisees
and
the
latter
said
to
them
Why
did
you
not
bring
him
in
46
The
officers
replied
Never
has
any
man
spoken
like
this
47
In
turn
the
Pharisees
answered
You
have
not
been
misled
also
have
you
48
Not
one
of
the
rulers
or
of
the
Pharisees
has
put
faith
in
him
has
he
49
But
this
crowd
who
do
not
know
the
Law
are
accursed
people
50
Nicodemus
who
had
come
to
him
previously
and
who
was
one
of
them
said
to
them
51
Our
Law
does
not
judge
a
man
unless
it
first
hears
from
him
and
learns
what
he
is
doing
does
it
52
In
answer
they
said
to
him
You
are
not
also
out
of
Galilee
are
you
Search
and
see
that
no
prophet
is
to
be
raised
up
out
of
Galilee
1
12
Then
Jesus
spoke
again
to
them
saying
I
am
the
light
of
the
world
Whoever
follows
me
will
by
no
means
walk
in
darkness
but
will
possess
the
light
of
life
13
So
the
Pharisees
said
to
him
You
bear
witness
about
yourself
your
witness
is
not
true
14
In
answer
Jesus
said
to
them
Even
if
I
do
bear
witness
about
myself
my
witness
is
true
because
I
know
where
I
came
from
and
where
I
am
going
But
you
do
not
know
where
I
came
from
and
where
I
am
going
15
You
judge
according
to
the
flesh
I
do
not
judge
any
man
at
all
16
And
yet
even
if
I
do
judge
my
judgment
is
truthful
because
I
am
not
alone
but
the
Father
who
sent
me
is
with
me
17
Also
in
your
own
Law
it
is
written
The
witness
of
two
men
is
true
18
I
am
one
who
bears
witness
about
myself
and
the
Father
who
sent
me
bears
witness
about
me
19
Then
they
said
to
him
Where
is
your
Father
Jesus
answered
You
know
neither
me
nor
my
Father
If
you
did
know
me
you
would
know
my
Father
also
20
He
spoke
these
words
in
the
treasury
as
he
was
teaching
in
the
temple
But
no
one
seized
him
for
his
hour
had
not
yet
come
21
So
he
said
to
them
again
I
am
going
away
and
you
will
look
for
me
and
yet
you
will
die
in
your
sin
Where
I
am
going
you
cannot
come
22
The
Jews
then
began
to
say
He
will
not
kill
himself
will
he
Because
he
says
Where
I
am
going
you
cannot
come
23
He
went
on
to
say
to
them
You
are
from
the
realms
below
I
am
from
the
realms
above
You
are
from
this
world
I
am
not
from
this
world
24
That
is
why
I
said
to
you
You
will
die
in
your
sins
For
if
you
do
not
believe
that
I
am
the
one
you
will
die
in
your
sins
25
So
they
began
to
say
to
him
Who
are
you
Jesus
replied
to
them
Why
am
I
even
speaking
to
you
at
all
26
I
have
many
things
to
speak
concerning
you
and
to
pass
judgment
on
As
a
matter
of
fact
the
One
who
sent
me
is
true
and
the
very
things
I
heard
from
him
I
am
speaking
in
the
world
27
They
did
not
grasp
that
he
was
talking
to
them
about
the
Father
28
Jesus
then
said
After
you
have
lifted
up
the
Son
of
man
then
you
will
know
that
I
am
he
and
that
I
do
nothing
of
my
own
initiative
but
just
as
the
Father
taught
me
I
speak
these
things
29
And
the
One
who
sent
me
is
with
me
he
did
not
abandon
me
to
myself
because
I
always
do
the
things
pleasing
to
him
30
As
he
was
saying
these
things
many
put
faith
in
him
31
Then
Jesus
went
on
to
say
to
the
Jews
who
had
believed
him
If
you
remain
in
my
word
you
are
really
my
disciples
32
and
you
will
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
will
set
you
free
33
They
replied
to
him
We
are
Abrahams
offspring
and
never
have
been
slaves
to
anyone
How
is
it
you
say
You
will
become
free
34
Jesus
answered
them
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
every
doer
of
sin
is
a
slave
of
sin
35
Moreover
the
slave
does
not
remain
in
the
household
forever
the
son
remains
forever
36
So
if
the
Son
sets
you
free
you
will
be
truly
free
37
I
know
that
you
are
Abrahams
offspring
But
you
are
seeking
to
kill
me
because
my
word
makes
no
progress
among
you
38
I
speak
the
things
I
have
seen
while
with
my
Father
but
you
do
the
things
you
have
heard
from
your
father
39
In
answer
they
said
to
him
Our
father
is
Abraham
Jesus
said
to
them
If
you
were
Abrahams
children
you
would
be
doing
the
works
of
Abraham
40
But
now
you
are
seeking
to
kill
me
a
man
who
has
told
you
the
truth
that
I
heard
from
God
Abraham
did
not
do
this
41
You
are
doing
the
works
of
your
father
They
said
to
him
We
were
not
born
from
immorality
we
have
one
Father
God
42
Jesus
said
to
them
If
God
were
your
Father
you
would
love
me
for
I
came
from
God
and
I
am
here
I
have
not
come
of
my
own
initiative
but
that
One
sent
me
43
Why
do
you
not
understand
what
I
am
saying
Because
you
cannot
listen
to
my
word
44
You
are
from
your
father
the
Devil
and
you
wish
to
do
the
desires
of
your
father
That
one
was
a
murderer
when
he
began
and
he
did
not
stand
fast
in
the
truth
because
truth
is
not
in
him
When
he
speaks
the
lie
he
speaks
according
to
his
own
disposition
because
he
is
a
liar
and
the
father
of
the
lie
45
Because
I
on
the
other
hand
tell
you
the
truth
you
do
not
believe
me
46
Who
of
you
convicts
me
of
sin
If
I
speak
truth
why
is
it
that
you
do
not
believe
me
47
The
one
who
is
from
God
listens
to
the
sayings
of
God
This
is
why
you
do
not
listen
because
you
are
not
from
God
48
In
answer
the
Jews
said
to
him
Are
we
not
right
in
saying
You
are
a
Samaritan
and
have
a
demon
49
Jesus
answered
I
do
not
have
a
demon
but
I
honor
my
Father
and
you
dishonor
me
50
But
I
am
not
seeking
glory
for
myself
there
is
One
who
is
seeking
and
judging
51
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
if
anyone
observes
my
word
he
will
never
see
death
at
all
52
The
Jews
said
to
him
Now
we
do
know
that
you
have
a
demon
Abraham
died
also
the
prophets
but
you
say
If
anyone
observes
my
word
he
will
never
taste
death
at
all
53
You
are
not
greater
than
our
father
Abraham
who
died
are
you
The
prophets
also
died
Who
do
you
claim
to
be
54
Jesus
answered
If
I
glorify
myself
my
glory
is
nothing
It
is
my
Father
who
glorifies
me
the
one
who
you
say
is
your
God
55
Yet
you
have
not
known
him
but
I
know
him
And
if
I
said
I
do
not
know
him
I
would
be
like
you
a
liar
But
I
do
know
him
and
am
observing
his
word
56
Abraham
your
father
rejoiced
greatly
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
my
day
and
he
saw
it
and
rejoiced
57
Then
the
Jews
said
to
him
You
are
not
yet
50
years
old
and
still
you
have
seen
Abraham
58
Jesus
said
to
them
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
before
Abraham
came
into
existence
I
have
been
59
So
they
picked
up
stones
to
throw
at
him
but
Jesus
hid
and
went
out
of
the
temple
1
As
he
was
passing
along
he
saw
a
man
who
had
been
blind
from
birth
2
And
his
disciples
asked
him
Rabbi
who
sinned
this
man
or
his
parents
so
that
he
was
born
blind
3
Jesus
answered
Neither
this
man
sinned
nor
his
parents
but
it
was
so
that
the
works
of
God
might
be
made
manifest
in
his
case
4
We
must
do
the
works
of
the
One
who
sent
me
while
it
is
day
the
night
is
coming
when
no
man
can
work
5
As
long
as
I
am
in
the
world
I
am
the
worlds
light
6
After
he
said
these
things
he
spat
on
the
ground
and
made
a
paste
with
the
saliva
and
he
smeared
the
paste
on
the
mans
eyes
7
and
said
to
him
Go
wash
in
the
pool
of
Siloam
which
is
translated
Sent
Forth
And
he
went
and
washed
and
came
back
seeing
8
Then
the
neighbors
and
those
who
formerly
used
to
see
that
he
was
a
beggar
began
to
say
This
is
the
man
who
used
to
sit
and
beg
is
it
not
9
Some
were
saying
This
is
he
Others
were
saying
No
but
he
looks
like
him
The
man
kept
saying
I
am
he
10
So
they
asked
him
How
then
were
your
eyes
opened
11
He
answered
The
man
called
Jesus
made
a
paste
and
smeared
it
on
my
eyes
and
said
to
me
Go
to
Siloam
and
wash
So
I
went
and
washed
and
gained
sight
12
At
this
they
said
to
him
Where
is
that
man
He
said
I
do
not
know
13
They
led
the
formerly
blind
man
to
the
Pharisees
14
Incidentally
the
day
that
Jesus
made
the
paste
and
opened
his
eyes
was
the
Sabbath
15
So
this
time
the
Pharisees
also
began
asking
the
man
how
he
gained
sight
He
said
to
them
He
put
a
paste
on
my
eyes
and
I
washed
and
I
can
see
16
Some
of
the
Pharisees
then
began
to
say
This
is
not
a
man
from
God
for
he
does
not
observe
the
Sabbath
Others
said
How
can
a
man
who
is
a
sinner
perform
signs
of
that
sort
So
there
was
a
division
among
them
17
And
again
they
said
to
the
blind
man
What
do
you
say
about
him
since
it
was
your
eyes
that
he
opened
The
man
said
He
is
a
prophet
18
However
the
Jews
did
not
believe
that
he
had
been
blind
and
had
gained
sight
until
they
called
the
parents
of
the
man
who
could
now
see
19
And
they
asked
them
Is
this
your
son
who
you
say
was
born
blind
How
then
does
he
now
see
20
His
parents
answered
We
know
that
this
is
our
son
and
that
he
was
born
blind
21
But
how
it
is
that
he
now
sees
we
do
not
know
or
who
opened
his
eyes
we
do
not
know
Ask
him
He
is
of
age
He
must
speak
for
himself
22
His
parents
said
these
things
because
they
were
in
fear
of
the
Jews
for
the
Jews
had
already
come
to
an
agreement
that
if
anyone
acknowledged
him
as
Christ
that
person
should
be
expelled
from
the
synagogue
23
This
is
why
his
parents
said
He
is
of
age
Question
him
24
So
a
second
time
they
called
the
man
who
had
been
blind
and
said
to
him
Give
glory
to
God
we
know
that
this
man
is
a
sinner
25
He
answered
Whether
he
is
a
sinner
I
do
not
know
One
thing
I
do
know
that
I
was
blind
but
now
I
can
see
26
Then
they
said
to
him
What
did
he
do
to
you
How
did
he
open
your
eyes
27
He
answered
them
I
told
you
already
and
yet
you
did
not
listen
Why
do
you
want
to
hear
it
again
You
do
not
want
to
become
his
disciples
also
do
you
28
At
this
they
scornfully
told
him
You
are
a
disciple
of
that
man
but
we
are
disciples
of
Moses
29
We
know
that
God
has
spoken
to
Moses
but
as
for
this
man
we
do
not
know
where
he
is
from
30
The
man
answered
them
This
is
certainly
amazing
that
you
do
not
know
where
he
is
from
and
yet
he
opened
my
eyes
31
We
know
that
God
does
not
listen
to
sinners
but
if
anyone
is
God-fearing
and
does
his
will
he
listens
to
this
one
32
From
of
old
it
has
never
been
heard
that
anyone
opened
the
eyes
of
one
born
blind
33
If
this
man
were
not
from
God
he
could
do
nothing
at
all
34
In
answer
they
said
to
him
You
were
altogether
born
in
sin
and
yet
are
you
teaching
us
And
they
threw
him
out
35
Jesus
heard
that
they
had
thrown
him
out
and
on
finding
him
he
said
Are
you
putting
faith
in
the
Son
of
man
36
The
man
answered
And
who
is
he
sir
so
that
I
may
put
faith
in
him
37
Jesus
said
to
him
You
have
seen
him
and
in
fact
he
is
the
one
speaking
with
you
38
He
said
I
do
put
faith
in
him
Lord
And
he
did
obeisance
to
him
39
Jesus
then
said
For
this
judgment
I
came
into
this
world
that
those
not
seeing
might
see
and
those
seeing
might
become
blind
40
Those
of
the
Pharisees
who
were
with
him
heard
these
things
and
they
said
to
him
We
are
not
blind
also
are
we
41
Jesus
said
to
them
If
you
were
blind
you
would
have
no
sin
But
now
you
say
We
see
Your
sin
remains
1
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
the
one
who
does
not
enter
into
the
sheepfold
through
the
door
but
climbs
in
by
another
way
that
one
is
a
thief
and
a
plunderer
2
But
the
one
who
enters
through
the
door
is
the
shepherd
of
the
sheep
3
The
doorkeeper
opens
to
this
one
and
the
sheep
listen
to
his
voice
He
calls
his
own
sheep
by
name
and
leads
them
out
4
When
he
has
brought
all
his
own
out
he
goes
ahead
of
them
and
the
sheep
follow
him
because
they
know
his
voice
5
They
will
by
no
means
follow
a
stranger
but
will
flee
from
him
because
they
do
not
know
the
voice
of
strangers
6
Jesus
spoke
this
comparison
to
them
but
they
did
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
to
them
7
So
Jesus
said
again
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
I
am
the
door
for
the
sheep
8
All
those
who
have
come
in
place
of
me
are
thieves
and
plunderers
but
the
sheep
have
not
listened
to
them
9
I
am
the
door
whoever
enters
through
me
will
be
saved
and
that
one
will
go
in
and
out
and
find
pasturage
10
The
thief
does
not
come
unless
it
is
to
steal
and
slay
and
destroy
I
have
come
that
they
may
have
life
and
have
it
in
abundance
11
I
am
the
fine
shepherd
the
fine
shepherd
surrenders
his
life
in
behalf
of
the
sheep
12
The
hired
man
who
is
not
a
shepherd
and
to
whom
the
sheep
do
not
belong
sees
the
wolf
coming
and
abandons
the
sheep
and
flees—and
the
wolf
snatches
them
and
scatters
them—
13
because
he
is
a
hired
man
and
does
not
care
for
the
sheep
14
I
am
the
fine
shepherd
I
know
my
sheep
and
my
sheep
know
me
15
just
as
the
Father
knows
me
and
I
know
the
Father
and
I
surrender
my
life
in
behalf
of
the
sheep
16
And
I
have
other
sheep
which
are
not
of
this
fold
those
too
I
must
bring
in
and
they
will
listen
to
my
voice
and
they
will
become
one
flock
one
shepherd
17
This
is
why
the
Father
loves
me
because
I
surrender
my
life
so
that
I
may
receive
it
again
18
No
man
takes
it
away
from
me
but
I
surrender
it
of
my
own
initiative
I
have
authority
to
surrender
it
and
I
have
authority
to
receive
it
again
This
commandment
I
received
from
my
Father
19
A
division
again
resulted
among
the
Jews
because
of
these
words
20
Many
of
them
were
saying
He
has
a
demon
and
is
out
of
his
mind
Why
do
you
listen
to
him
21
Others
said
These
are
not
the
sayings
of
a
demonized
man
A
demon
cannot
open
blind
peoples
eyes
can
it
22
At
that
time
the
Festival
of
Dedication
took
place
in
Jerusalem
It
was
wintertime
23
and
Jesus
was
walking
in
the
temple
in
the
colonnade
of
Solomon
24
Then
the
Jews
surrounded
him
and
began
to
say
to
him
How
long
are
you
going
to
keep
us
in
suspense
If
you
are
the
Christ
tell
us
plainly
25
Jesus
answered
them
I
told
you
and
yet
you
do
not
believe
The
works
that
I
am
doing
in
my
Fathers
name
these
bear
witness
about
me
26
But
you
do
not
believe
because
you
are
not
my
sheep
27
My
sheep
listen
to
my
voice
and
I
know
them
and
they
follow
me
28
I
give
them
everlasting
life
and
they
will
by
no
means
ever
be
destroyed
and
no
one
will
snatch
them
out
of
my
hand
29
What
my
Father
has
given
me
is
something
greater
than
all
other
things
and
no
one
can
snatch
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Father
30
I
and
the
Father
are
one
31
Once
again
the
Jews
picked
up
stones
to
stone
him
32
Jesus
replied
to
them
I
displayed
to
you
many
fine
works
from
the
Father
For
which
of
those
works
are
you
stoning
me
33
The
Jews
answered
him
We
are
stoning
you
not
for
a
fine
work
but
for
blasphemy
for
you
although
being
a
man
make
yourself
a
god
34
Jesus
answered
them
Is
it
not
written
in
your
Law
I
said
You
are
gods
35
If
he
called
gods
those
against
whom
the
word
of
God
came—and
yet
the
scripture
cannot
be
nullified—
36
do
you
say
to
me
whom
the
Father
sanctified
and
sent
into
the
world
You
blaspheme

because
I
said
I
am
Gods
Son
37
If
I
am
not
doing
the
works
of
my
Father
do
not
believe
me
38
But
if
I
am
doing
them
even
though
you
do
not
believe
me
believe
the
works
so
that
you
may
come
to
know
and
may
continue
knowing
that
the
Father
is
in
union
with
me
and
I
am
in
union
with
the
Father
39
So
they
tried
again
to
seize
him
but
he
escaped
from
their
reach
40
And
he
went
away
again
across
the
Jordan
to
the
place
where
John
was
baptizing
at
first
and
he
stayed
there
41
And
many
people
came
to
him
and
began
saying
John
did
not
perform
a
single
sign
but
all
the
things
John
said
about
this
man
were
true
42
And
many
put
faith
in
him
there
1
Now
a
man
named
Lazarus
was
sick
he
was
from
Bethany
the
village
of
Mary
and
her
sister
Martha
2
This
was
the
Mary
who
poured
perfumed
oil
on
the
Lord
and
wiped
his
feet
dry
with
her
hair
it
was
her
brother
Lazarus
who
was
sick
3
So
his
sisters
sent
a
message
to
him
saying
Lord
see
the
one
you
have
affection
for
is
sick
4
But
when
Jesus
heard
it
he
said
This
sickness
is
not
meant
to
end
in
death
but
is
for
the
glory
of
God
so
that
the
Son
of
God
may
be
glorified
through
it
5
Now
Jesus
loved
Martha
and
her
sister
and
Lazarus
6
However
when
he
heard
that
Lazarus
was
sick
he
actually
remained
in
the
place
where
he
was
for
two
more
days
7
Then
after
this
he
said
to
the
disciples
Let
us
go
into
Judea
again
8
The
disciples
said
to
him
Rabbi
just
lately
the
Judeans
were
seeking
to
stone
you
and
are
you
going
there
again
9
Jesus
answered
There
are
12
hours
of
daylight
are
there
not
If
anyone
walks
in
daylight
he
does
not
stumble
into
anything
because
he
sees
the
light
of
this
world
10
But
if
anyone
walks
in
the
night
he
stumbles
because
the
light
is
not
in
him
11
After
he
said
these
things
he
added
Lazarus
our
friend
has
fallen
asleep
but
I
am
traveling
there
to
awaken
him
12
The
disciples
then
said
to
him
Lord
if
he
is
sleeping
he
will
get
well
13
Jesus
however
had
spoken
about
his
death
But
they
imagined
he
was
speaking
about
taking
rest
in
sleep
14
Then
Jesus
said
to
them
plainly
Lazarus
has
died
15
and
I
rejoice
for
your
sake
that
I
was
not
there
so
that
you
may
believe
But
let
us
go
to
him
16
So
Thomas
who
was
called
the
Twin
said
to
his
fellow
disciples
Let
us
also
go
so
that
we
may
die
with
him
17
When
Jesus
arrived
he
found
that
Lazarus
had
already
been
in
the
tomb
for
four
days
18
Now
Bethany
was
near
Jerusalem
about
two
miles
away
19
And
many
of
the
Jews
had
come
to
Martha
and
Mary
to
console
them
concerning
their
brother
20
When
Martha
heard
that
Jesus
was
coming
she
went
to
meet
him
but
Mary
kept
sitting
at
home
21
Martha
then
said
to
Jesus
Lord
if
you
had
been
here
my
brother
would
not
have
died
22
Yet
even
now
I
know
that
whatever
you
ask
God
for
God
will
give
you
23
Jesus
said
to
her
Your
brother
will
rise
24
Martha
said
to
him
I
know
he
will
rise
in
the
resurrection
on
the
last
day
25
Jesus
said
to
her
I
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
The
one
who
exercises
faith
in
me
even
though
he
dies
will
come
to
life
26
and
everyone
who
is
living
and
exercises
faith
in
me
will
never
die
at
all
Do
you
believe
this
27
She
said
to
him
Yes
Lord
I
have
believed
that
you
are
the
Christ
the
Son
of
God
the
one
coming
into
the
world
28
When
she
had
said
this
she
went
off
and
called
Mary
her
sister
saying
privately
The
Teacher
is
here
and
is
calling
you
29
On
hearing
this
she
got
up
quickly
and
went
to
him
30
Jesus
had
not
yet
come
into
the
village
but
he
was
still
in
the
place
where
Martha
had
met
him
31
When
the
Jews
who
were
with
Mary
in
the
house
consoling
her
saw
her
get
up
quickly
and
go
out
they
followed
her
supposing
that
she
was
going
to
the
tomb
to
weep
there
32
When
Mary
arrived
where
Jesus
was
and
caught
sight
of
him
she
fell
at
his
feet
and
said
to
him
Lord
if
you
had
been
here
my
brother
would
not
have
died
33
When
Jesus
saw
her
weeping
and
the
Jews
who
had
come
with
her
weeping
he
groaned
within
himself
and
became
troubled
34
He
said
Where
have
you
laid
him
They
said
to
him
Lord
come
and
see
35
Jesus
gave
way
to
tears
36
At
that
the
Jews
began
to
say
See
what
affection
he
had
for
him
37
But
some
of
them
said
Could
not
this
man
who
opened
the
eyes
of
the
blind
man
prevent
this
one
from
dying
38
Then
Jesus
after
groaning
again
within
himself
came
to
the
tomb
It
was
in
fact
a
cave
and
a
stone
was
lying
against
it
39
Jesus
said
Take
the
stone
away
Martha
the
sister
of
the
deceased
said
to
him
Lord
by
now
he
must
smell
for
it
has
been
four
days
40
Jesus
said
to
her
Did
I
not
tell
you
that
if
you
would
believe
you
would
see
the
glory
of
God
41
So
they
took
the
stone
away
Then
Jesus
raised
his
eyes
heavenward
and
said
Father
I
thank
you
that
you
have
heard
me
42
True
I
knew
that
you
always
hear
me
but
I
spoke
on
account
of
the
crowd
standing
around
so
that
they
may
believe
that
you
sent
me
43
When
he
had
said
these
things
he
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
Lazarus
come
out
44
The
man
who
had
been
dead
came
out
with
his
feet
and
hands
bound
with
wrappings
and
his
face
was
wrapped
with
a
cloth
Jesus
said
to
them
Free
him
and
let
him
go
45
Therefore
many
of
the
Jews
who
had
come
to
Mary
and
who
saw
what
he
did
put
faith
in
him
46
but
some
of
them
went
off
to
the
Pharisees
and
told
them
what
Jesus
had
done
47
So
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
gathered
the
Sanhedrin
together
and
said
What
are
we
to
do
for
this
man
performs
many
signs
48
If
we
let
him
go
on
this
way
they
will
all
put
faith
in
him
and
the
Romans
will
come
and
take
away
both
our
place
and
our
nation
49
But
one
of
them
Caiaphas
who
was
high
priest
that
year
said
to
them
You
do
not
know
anything
at
all
50
and
you
have
not
reasoned
that
it
is
to
your
benefit
for
one
man
to
die
in
behalf
of
the
people
rather
than
for
the
whole
nation
to
be
destroyed
51
He
did
not
say
this
however
of
his
own
originality
but
because
he
was
high
priest
that
year
he
prophesied
that
Jesus
was
to
die
for
the
nation
52
and
not
only
for
the
nation
but
also
to
gather
together
into
one
the
children
of
God
who
were
scattered
about
53
So
from
that
day
on
they
conspired
to
kill
him
54
Therefore
Jesus
no
longer
walked
about
publicly
among
the
Jews
but
he
departed
from
there
to
the
region
near
the
wilderness
to
a
city
called
Ephraim
and
he
stayed
there
with
the
disciples
55
Now
the
Passover
of
the
Jews
was
near
and
many
people
from
the
countryside
went
up
to
Jerusalem
before
the
Passover
to
cleanse
themselves
ceremonially
56
They
were
looking
for
Jesus
and
they
were
saying
to
one
another
as
they
stood
around
in
the
temple
What
is
your
opinion
That
he
will
not
come
to
the
festival
at
all
57
But
the
chief
priests
and
the
Pharisees
had
given
orders
that
if
anyone
got
to
know
where
Jesus
was
he
should
report
it
so
that
they
could
seize
him
1
Six
days
before
the
Passover
Jesus
arrived
at
Bethany
where
Lazarus
was
whom
Jesus
had
raised
up
from
the
dead
2
So
they
spread
an
evening
meal
for
him
there
and
Martha
was
serving
them
but
Lazarus
was
one
of
those
dining
with
him
3
Then
Mary
took
a
pound
of
perfumed
oil
genuine
nard
very
costly
and
she
poured
it
on
the
feet
of
Jesus
and
wiped
his
feet
dry
with
her
hair
The
house
became
filled
with
the
scent
of
the
perfumed
oil
4
But
Judas
Iscariot
one
of
his
disciples
who
was
about
to
betray
him
said
5
Why
was
this
perfumed
oil
not
sold
for
300
denarii
and
given
to
the
poor
6
He
said
this
though
not
because
he
was
concerned
about
the
poor
but
because
he
was
a
thief
and
had
the
money
box
and
used
to
steal
the
money
put
in
it
7
Then
Jesus
said
Let
her
alone
so
that
she
may
keep
this
observance
in
view
of
the
day
of
my
burial
8
For
you
always
have
the
poor
with
you
but
you
will
not
always
have
me
9
Meanwhile
a
large
crowd
of
Jews
got
to
know
that
he
was
there
and
they
came
not
only
because
of
Jesus
but
also
to
see
Lazarus
whom
he
had
raised
up
from
the
dead
10
The
chief
priests
now
conspired
to
kill
Lazarus
also
11
since
it
was
because
of
him
that
many
of
the
Jews
were
going
there
and
putting
faith
in
Jesus
12
The
next
day
the
large
crowd
that
had
come
to
the
festival
heard
that
Jesus
was
coming
to
Jerusalem
13
So
they
took
branches
of
palm
trees
and
went
out
to
meet
him
and
they
began
to
shout
Save
we
pray
you
Blessed
is
the
one
who
comes
in
Jehovahs
name
the
King
of
Israel
14
When
Jesus
found
a
young
donkey
he
sat
on
it
just
as
it
is
written
15
Have
no
fear
daughter
of
Zion
Look
Your
king
is
coming
seated
on
a
donkeys
colt
16
These
things
his
disciples
did
not
understand
at
first
but
when
Jesus
was
glorified
they
recalled
that
these
things
were
written
about
him
and
that
they
did
these
things
to
him
17
Now
the
crowd
that
was
with
him
when
he
called
Lazarus
out
of
the
tomb
and
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
kept
bearing
witness
18
This
is
also
why
the
crowd
went
to
meet
him
because
they
heard
he
had
performed
this
sign
19
So
the
Pharisees
said
among
themselves
You
see
that
you
are
not
getting
anywhere
Look
The
whole
world
has
gone
after
him
20
Now
there
were
some
Greeks
among
those
who
had
come
to
worship
at
the
festival
21
So
these
approached
Philip
who
was
from
Bethsaida
of
Galilee
and
they
began
to
request
him
saying
Sir
we
want
to
see
Jesus
22
Philip
came
and
told
Andrew
Andrew
and
Philip
came
and
told
Jesus
23
But
Jesus
answered
them
The
hour
has
come
for
the
Son
of
man
to
be
glorified
24
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
unless
a
grain
of
wheat
falls
to
the
ground
and
dies
it
remains
just
one
grain
but
if
it
dies
it
then
bears
much
fruit
25
Whoever
is
fond
of
his
life
destroys
it
but
whoever
hates
his
life
in
this
world
will
safeguard
it
for
everlasting
life
26
If
anyone
would
minister
to
me
let
him
follow
me
and
where
I
am
there
my
minister
will
be
also
If
anyone
would
minister
to
me
the
Father
will
honor
him
27
Now
I
am
troubled
and
what
should
I
say
Father
save
me
out
of
this
hour
Nevertheless
this
is
why
I
have
come
to
this
hour
28
Father
glorify
your
name
Then
a
voice
came
out
of
heaven
I
have
glorified
it
and
will
glorify
it
again
29
The
crowd
that
was
standing
there
heard
it
and
began
to
say
that
it
had
thundered
Others
said
An
angel
has
spoken
to
him
30
Jesus
answered
This
voice
has
occurred
not
for
my
sake
but
for
your
sakes
31
Now
there
is
a
judging
of
this
world
now
the
ruler
of
this
world
will
be
cast
out
32
And
yet
I
if
I
am
lifted
up
from
the
earth
will
draw
all
sorts
of
men
to
myself
33
This
he
was
really
saying
to
indicate
what
sort
of
death
he
was
about
to
die
34
Then
the
crowd
answered
him
We
heard
from
the
Law
that
the
Christ
remains
forever
How
can
you
say
that
the
Son
of
man
must
be
lifted
up
Who
is
this
Son
of
man
35
So
Jesus
said
to
them
The
light
will
be
among
you
a
little
while
longer
Walk
while
you
still
have
the
light
so
that
darkness
does
not
overpower
you
whoever
walks
in
the
darkness
does
not
know
where
he
is
going
36
While
you
have
the
light
exercise
faith
in
the
light
so
that
you
may
become
sons
of
light
Jesus
said
these
things
and
went
off
and
hid
from
them
37
Although
he
had
performed
so
many
signs
before
them
they
were
not
putting
faith
in
him
38
so
that
the
word
of
Isaiah
the
prophet
might
be
fulfilled
who
said
Jehovah
who
has
put
faith
in
the
thing
heard
from
us
And
as
for
the
arm
of
Jehovah
to
whom
has
it
been
revealed
39
The
reason
why
they
were
not
able
to
believe
is
that
again
Isaiah
said
40
He
has
blinded
their
eyes
and
has
made
their
hearts
hard
so
that
they
would
not
see
with
their
eyes
and
understand
with
their
hearts
and
turn
around
and
I
heal
them
41
Isaiah
said
these
things
because
he
saw
his
glory
and
he
spoke
about
him
42
All
the
same
many
even
of
the
rulers
actually
put
faith
in
him
but
they
would
not
acknowledge
him
because
of
the
Pharisees
so
that
they
would
not
be
expelled
from
the
synagogue
43
for
they
loved
the
glory
of
men
even
more
than
the
glory
of
God
44
However
Jesus
called
out
and
said
Whoever
puts
faith
in
me
puts
faith
not
only
in
me
but
also
in
him
who
sent
me
45
and
whoever
sees
me
sees
also
the
One
who
sent
me
46
I
have
come
as
a
light
into
the
world
so
that
everyone
putting
faith
in
me
may
not
remain
in
the
darkness
47
But
if
anyone
hears
my
sayings
and
does
not
keep
them
I
do
not
judge
him
for
I
came
not
to
judge
the
world
but
to
save
the
world
48
Whoever
disregards
me
and
does
not
receive
my
sayings
has
one
to
judge
him
The
word
that
I
have
spoken
is
what
will
judge
him
on
the
last
day
49
For
I
have
not
spoken
of
my
own
initiative
but
the
Father
who
sent
me
has
himself
given
me
a
commandment
about
what
to
say
and
what
to
speak
50
And
I
know
that
his
commandment
means
everlasting
life
So
whatever
I
speak
I
speak
just
as
the
Father
has
told
me
1
Now
because
he
knew
before
the
festival
of
the
Passover
that
his
hour
had
come
for
him
to
leave
this
world
and
go
to
the
Father
Jesus
having
loved
his
own
who
were
in
the
world
loved
them
to
the
end
2
The
evening
meal
was
going
on
and
the
Devil
had
already
put
it
into
the
heart
of
Judas
Iscariot
the
son
of
Simon
to
betray
him
3
So
Jesus
knowing
that
the
Father
had
given
all
things
into
his
hands
and
that
he
came
from
God
and
was
going
to
God
4
got
up
from
the
evening
meal
and
laid
aside
his
outer
garments
And
taking
a
towel
he
wrapped
it
around
his
waist
5
After
that
he
put
water
into
a
basin
and
started
to
wash
the
feet
of
the
disciples
and
to
dry
them
off
with
the
towel
that
was
wrapped
around
him
6
Then
he
came
to
Simon
Peter
He
said
to
him
Lord
are
you
washing
my
feet
7
Jesus
answered
him
What
I
am
doing
you
do
not
understand
now
but
you
will
understand
after
these
things
8
Peter
said
to
him
You
will
certainly
never
wash
my
feet
Jesus
answered
him
Unless
I
wash
you
you
have
no
share
with
me
9
Simon
Peter
said
to
him
Lord
wash
not
only
my
feet
but
also
my
hands
and
my
head
10
Jesus
said
to
him
Whoever
has
bathed
does
not
need
to
have
more
than
his
feet
washed
but
is
completely
clean
And
you
men
are
clean
but
not
all
of
you
11
For
he
knew
the
man
who
was
betraying
him
This
is
why
he
said
Not
all
of
you
are
clean
12
When
now
he
had
washed
their
feet
and
had
put
his
outer
garments
on
he
again
reclined
at
the
table
and
said
to
them
Do
you
understand
what
I
have
done
to
you
13
You
address
me
as
Teacher
and
Lord

and
you
are
correct
for
I
am
such
14
Therefore
if
I
the
Lord
and
Teacher
washed
your
feet
you
also
should
wash
the
feet
of
one
another
15
For
I
set
the
pattern
for
you
that
just
as
I
did
to
you
you
should
also
do
16
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
a
slave
is
not
greater
than
his
master
nor
is
one
who
is
sent
greater
than
the
one
who
sent
him
17
If
you
know
these
things
happy
you
are
if
you
do
them
18
I
am
not
talking
about
all
of
you
I
know
the
ones
I
have
chosen
But
this
was
so
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled
The
one
who
was
eating
my
bread
has
lifted
his
heel
against
me
19
From
this
moment
on
I
am
telling
you
before
it
occurs
so
that
when
it
does
occur
you
may
believe
that
I
am
he
20
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
whoever
receives
anyone
I
send
receives
me
also
and
whoever
receives
me
receives
also
the
One
who
sent
me
21
After
saying
these
things
Jesus
became
troubled
in
spirit
and
he
bore
witness
saying
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
one
of
you
will
betray
me
22
The
disciples
began
to
look
at
one
another
being
at
a
loss
as
to
which
one
he
was
talking
about
23
One
of
the
disciples
the
one
whom
Jesus
loved
was
reclining
close
to
Jesus
24
Therefore
Simon
Peter
nodded
to
this
one
and
said
to
him
Tell
us
whom
he
is
talking
about
25
So
the
latter
leaned
back
on
the
chest
of
Jesus
and
said
to
him
Lord
who
is
it
26
Jesus
answered
It
is
the
one
to
whom
I
will
give
the
piece
of
bread
that
I
dip
So
after
dipping
the
bread
he
took
it
and
gave
it
to
Judas
the
son
of
Simon
Iscariot
27
After
Judas
took
the
piece
of
bread
then
Satan
entered
into
him
So
Jesus
said
to
him
What
you
are
doing
do
it
more
quickly
28
However
none
of
those
reclining
at
the
table
knew
why
he
said
this
to
him
29
Some
in
fact
were
thinking
that
since
Judas
was
holding
the
money
box
Jesus
was
telling
him
Buy
what
we
need
for
the
festival

or
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
poor
30
So
after
he
received
the
piece
of
bread
he
went
out
immediately
And
it
was
night
31
When
therefore
he
had
gone
out
Jesus
said
Now
the
Son
of
man
is
glorified
and
God
is
glorified
in
connection
with
him
32
God
himself
will
glorify
him
and
he
will
glorify
him
immediately
33
Little
children
I
am
with
you
a
little
longer
You
will
look
for
me
and
just
as
I
said
to
the
Jews
Where
I
go
you
cannot
come

I
now
say
it
also
to
you
34
I
am
giving
you
a
new
commandment
that
you
love
one
another
just
as
I
have
loved
you
you
also
love
one
another
35
By
this
all
will
know
that
you
are
my
disciples—if
you
have
love
among
yourselves
36
Simon
Peter
said
to
him
Lord
where
are
you
going
Jesus
answered
Where
I
am
going
you
cannot
follow
me
now
but
you
will
follow
later
37
Peter
said
to
him
Lord
why
is
it
I
cannot
follow
you
now
I
will
surrender
my
life
in
your
behalf
38
Jesus
answered
Will
you
surrender
your
life
in
my
behalf
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
a
rooster
will
by
no
means
crow
until
you
have
disowned
me
three
times
1
Do
not
let
your
hearts
be
troubled
Exercise
faith
in
God
exercise
faith
also
in
me
2
In
the
house
of
my
Father
are
many
dwelling
places
Otherwise
I
would
have
told
you
for
I
am
going
my
way
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
3
Also
if
I
go
my
way
and
prepare
a
place
for
you
I
will
come
again
and
will
receive
you
home
to
myself
so
that
where
I
am
you
also
may
be
4
And
where
I
am
going
you
know
the
way
5
Thomas
said
to
him
Lord
we
do
not
know
where
you
are
going
How
can
we
know
the
way
6
Jesus
said
to
him
I
am
the
way
and
the
truth
and
the
life
No
one
comes
to
the
Father
except
through
me
7
If
you
men
had
known
me
you
would
have
known
my
Father
also
from
this
moment
on
you
know
him
and
have
seen
him
8
Philip
said
to
him
Lord
show
us
the
Father
and
it
is
enough
for
us
9
Jesus
said
to
him
Even
after
I
have
been
with
you
men
for
such
a
long
time
Philip
have
you
not
come
to
know
me
Whoever
has
seen
me
has
seen
the
Father
also
How
is
it
you
say
Show
us
the
Father
10
Do
you
not
believe
that
I
am
in
union
with
the
Father
and
the
Father
is
in
union
with
me
The
things
I
say
to
you
I
do
not
speak
of
my
own
originality
but
the
Father
who
remains
in
union
with
me
is
doing
his
works
11
Believe
me
that
I
am
in
union
with
the
Father
and
the
Father
is
in
union
with
me
otherwise
believe
because
of
the
works
themselves
12
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
whoever
exercises
faith
in
me
will
also
do
the
works
that
I
do
and
he
will
do
works
greater
than
these
because
I
am
going
my
way
to
the
Father
13
Also
whatever
you
ask
in
my
name
I
will
do
this
so
that
the
Father
may
be
glorified
in
connection
with
the
Son
14
If
you
ask
anything
in
my
name
I
will
do
it
15
If
you
love
me
you
will
observe
my
commandments
16
And
I
will
ask
the
Father
and
he
will
give
you
another
helper
to
be
with
you
forever
17
the
spirit
of
the
truth
which
the
world
cannot
receive
because
it
neither
sees
it
nor
knows
it
You
know
it
because
it
remains
with
you
and
is
in
you
18
I
will
not
leave
you
bereaved
I
am
coming
to
you
19
In
a
little
while
the
world
will
see
me
no
more
but
you
will
see
me
because
I
live
and
you
will
live
20
In
that
day
you
will
know
that
I
am
in
union
with
my
Father
and
you
are
in
union
with
me
and
I
am
in
union
with
you
21
Whoever
has
my
commandments
and
observes
them
is
the
one
who
loves
me
In
turn
whoever
loves
me
will
be
loved
by
my
Father
and
I
will
love
him
and
will
clearly
show
myself
to
him
22
Judas
not
Iscariot
said
to
him
Lord
what
has
happened
that
you
intend
to
show
yourself
clearly
to
us
and
not
to
the
world
23
In
answer
Jesus
said
to
him
If
anyone
loves
me
he
will
observe
my
word
and
my
Father
will
love
him
and
we
will
come
to
him
and
make
our
dwelling
with
him
24
Whoever
does
not
love
me
does
not
observe
my
words
The
word
that
you
are
hearing
is
not
mine
but
belongs
to
the
Father
who
sent
me
25
I
have
spoken
these
things
to
you
while
I
am
still
with
you
26
But
the
helper
the
holy
spirit
which
the
Father
will
send
in
my
name
that
one
will
teach
you
all
things
and
bring
back
to
your
minds
all
the
things
I
told
you
27
I
leave
you
peace
I
give
you
my
peace
I
do
not
give
it
to
you
the
way
that
the
world
gives
it
Do
not
let
your
hearts
be
troubled
nor
let
them
shrink
out
of
fear
28
You
heard
that
I
said
to
you
I
am
going
away
and
I
am
coming
back
to
you
If
you
loved
me
you
would
rejoice
that
I
am
going
to
the
Father
for
the
Father
is
greater
than
I
am
29
So
now
I
have
told
you
before
it
occurs
so
that
you
may
believe
when
it
does
occur
30
I
will
not
speak
with
you
much
more
for
the
ruler
of
the
world
is
coming
and
he
has
no
hold
on
me
31
But
for
the
world
to
know
that
I
love
the
Father
I
am
doing
just
as
the
Father
has
commanded
me
to
do
Get
up
let
us
go
from
here
1
I
am
the
true
vine
and
my
Father
is
the
cultivator
2
He
takes
away
every
branch
in
me
not
bearing
fruit
and
he
cleans
every
one
bearing
fruit
so
that
it
may
bear
more
fruit
3
You
are
already
clean
because
of
the
word
that
I
have
spoken
to
you
4
Remain
in
union
with
me
and
I
will
remain
in
union
with
you
Just
as
the
branch
cannot
bear
fruit
by
itself
unless
it
remains
in
the
vine
neither
can
you
unless
you
remain
in
union
with
me
5
I
am
the
vine
you
are
the
branches
Whoever
remains
in
union
with
me
and
I
in
union
with
him
this
one
bears
much
fruit
for
apart
from
me
you
can
do
nothing
at
all
6
If
anyone
does
not
remain
in
union
with
me
he
is
thrown
out
like
a
branch
and
dries
up
And
men
gather
those
branches
and
throw
them
into
the
fire
and
they
are
burned
7
If
you
remain
in
union
with
me
and
my
sayings
remain
in
you
ask
whatever
you
wish
and
it
will
take
place
for
you
8
My
Father
is
glorified
in
this
that
you
keep
bearing
much
fruit
and
prove
yourselves
my
disciples
9
Just
as
the
Father
has
loved
me
so
I
have
loved
you
remain
in
my
love
10
If
you
observe
my
commandments
you
will
remain
in
my
love
just
as
I
have
observed
the
commandments
of
the
Father
and
remain
in
his
love
11
These
things
I
have
spoken
to
you
so
that
my
joy
may
be
in
you
and
your
joy
may
be
made
full
12
This
is
my
commandment
that
you
love
one
another
just
as
I
have
loved
you
13
No
one
has
love
greater
than
this
that
someone
should
surrender
his
life
in
behalf
of
his
friends
14
You
are
my
friends
if
you
do
what
I
am
commanding
you
15
I
no
longer
call
you
slaves
because
a
slave
does
not
know
what
his
master
does
But
I
have
called
you
friends
because
I
have
made
known
to
you
all
the
things
I
have
heard
from
my
Father
16
You
did
not
choose
me
but
I
chose
you
and
I
appointed
you
to
go
and
keep
bearing
fruit
and
that
your
fruit
should
remain
so
that
no
matter
what
you
ask
the
Father
in
my
name
he
may
give
it
to
you
17
These
things
I
command
you
that
you
love
one
another
18
If
the
world
hates
you
you
know
that
it
has
hated
me
before
it
hated
you
19
If
you
were
part
of
the
world
the
world
would
be
fond
of
what
is
its
own
Now
because
you
are
no
part
of
the
world
but
I
have
chosen
you
out
of
the
world
for
this
reason
the
world
hates
you
20
Keep
in
mind
the
word
I
said
to
you
A
slave
is
not
greater
than
his
master
If
they
have
persecuted
me
they
will
also
persecute
you
if
they
have
observed
my
word
they
will
also
observe
yours
21
But
they
will
do
all
these
things
against
you
on
account
of
my
name
because
they
do
not
know
the
One
who
sent
me
22
If
I
had
not
come
and
spoken
to
them
they
would
have
no
sin
But
now
they
have
no
excuse
for
their
sin
23
Whoever
hates
me
also
hates
my
Father
24
If
I
had
not
done
among
them
the
works
that
no
one
else
did
they
would
have
no
sin
but
now
they
have
both
seen
me
and
hated
me
as
well
as
my
Father
25
But
this
happened
in
order
to
fulfill
the
word
written
in
their
Law
They
hated
me
without
cause
26
When
the
helper
comes
that
I
will
send
you
from
the
Father
the
spirit
of
the
truth
which
comes
from
the
Father
that
one
will
bear
witness
about
me
27
and
you
in
turn
are
to
bear
witness
because
you
have
been
with
me
from
the
beginning
1
I
have
said
these
things
to
you
so
that
you
may
not
be
stumbled
2
Men
will
expel
you
from
the
synagogue
In
fact
the
hour
is
coming
when
everyone
who
kills
you
will
think
he
has
offered
a
sacred
service
to
God
3
But
they
will
do
these
things
because
they
have
not
come
to
know
either
the
Father
or
me
4
Nevertheless
I
have
told
you
these
things
so
that
when
the
hour
for
them
to
happen
arrives
you
will
remember
that
I
told
them
to
you
I
did
not
tell
you
these
things
at
first
because
I
was
with
you
5
But
now
I
am
going
to
the
One
who
sent
me
yet
not
one
of
you
asks
me
Where
are
you
going
6
But
because
I
have
told
you
these
things
grief
has
filled
your
hearts
7
Nevertheless
I
am
telling
you
the
truth
it
is
for
your
benefit
that
I
am
going
away
For
if
I
do
not
go
away
the
helper
will
not
come
to
you
but
if
I
do
go
I
will
send
him
to
you
8
And
when
that
one
comes
he
will
give
the
world
convincing
evidence
concerning
sin
and
concerning
righteousness
and
concerning
judgment
9
first
concerning
sin
because
they
are
not
exercising
faith
in
me
10
then
concerning
righteousness
because
I
am
going
to
the
Father
and
you
will
see
me
no
longer
11
then
concerning
judgment
because
the
ruler
of
this
world
has
been
judged
12
I
still
have
many
things
to
say
to
you
but
you
are
not
able
to
bear
them
now
13
However
when
that
one
comes
the
spirit
of
the
truth
he
will
guide
you
into
all
the
truth
for
he
will
not
speak
of
his
own
initiative
but
what
he
hears
he
will
speak
and
he
will
declare
to
you
the
things
to
come
14
That
one
will
glorify
me
because
he
will
receive
from
what
is
mine
and
will
declare
it
to
you
15
All
the
things
that
the
Father
has
are
mine
That
is
why
I
said
he
receives
from
what
is
mine
and
declares
it
to
you
16
In
a
little
while
you
will
see
me
no
longer
and
again
in
a
little
while
you
will
see
me
17
At
that
some
of
his
disciples
said
to
one
another
What
does
he
mean
by
saying
to
us
In
a
little
while
you
will
not
see
me
and
again
in
a
little
while
you
will
see
me

and
because
I
am
going
to
the
Father
18
So
they
were
saying
What
does
he
mean
by
saying
a
little
while
We
do
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
19
Jesus
knew
they
wanted
to
question
him
so
he
said
to
them
Are
you
asking
one
another
this
because
I
said
In
a
little
while
you
will
not
see
me
and
again
in
a
little
while
you
will
see
me
20
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
you
will
weep
and
wail
but
the
world
will
rejoice
you
will
be
grieved
but
your
grief
will
be
turned
into
joy
21
When
a
woman
is
giving
birth
she
has
grief
because
her
hour
has
come
but
when
she
has
given
birth
to
the
child
she
remembers
the
tribulation
no
more
because
of
the
joy
that
a
man
has
been
born
into
the
world
22
So
you
also
now
you
have
grief
but
I
will
see
you
again
and
your
hearts
will
rejoice
and
no
one
will
take
away
your
joy
23
In
that
day
you
will
ask
me
no
question
at
all
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
if
you
ask
the
Father
for
anything
he
will
give
it
to
you
in
my
name
24
Until
now
you
have
not
asked
for
a
single
thing
in
my
name
Ask
and
you
will
receive
so
that
your
joy
may
be
complete
25
I
have
spoken
these
things
to
you
in
comparisons
The
hour
is
coming
when
I
will
no
longer
speak
to
you
in
comparisons
but
I
will
tell
you
plainly
about
the
Father
26
In
that
day
you
will
make
request
of
the
Father
in
my
name
in
saying
this
I
do
not
mean
that
I
will
make
request
for
you
27
For
the
Father
himself
has
affection
for
you
because
you
have
had
affection
for
me
and
have
believed
that
I
came
as
Gods
representative
28
I
came
as
the
Fathers
representative
and
have
come
into
the
world
Now
I
am
leaving
the
world
and
am
going
to
the
Father
29
His
disciples
said
See
Now
you
are
speaking
plainly
and
are
not
using
comparisons
30
Now
we
know
that
you
know
all
things
and
you
do
not
need
to
have
anyone
question
you
By
this
we
believe
that
you
came
from
God
31
Jesus
answered
them
Do
you
believe
now
32
Look
The
hour
is
coming
indeed
it
has
come
when
each
one
of
you
will
be
scattered
to
his
own
house
and
you
will
leave
me
alone
But
I
am
not
alone
because
the
Father
is
with
me
33
I
have
said
these
things
to
you
so
that
by
means
of
me
you
may
have
peace
In
the
world
you
will
have
tribulation
but
take
courage
I
have
conquered
the
world
1
Jesus
spoke
these
things
and
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
he
said
Father
the
hour
has
come
Glorify
your
son
so
that
your
son
may
glorify
you
2
just
as
you
have
given
him
authority
over
all
flesh
so
that
he
may
give
everlasting
life
to
all
those
whom
you
have
given
to
him
3
This
means
everlasting
life
their
coming
to
know
you
the
only
true
God
and
the
one
whom
you
sent
Jesus
Christ
4
I
have
glorified
you
on
the
earth
having
finished
the
work
you
have
given
me
to
do
5
So
now
Father
glorify
me
at
your
side
with
the
glory
that
I
had
alongside
you
before
the
world
was
6
I
have
made
your
name
manifest
to
the
men
whom
you
gave
me
out
of
the
world
They
were
yours
and
you
gave
them
to
me
and
they
have
observed
your
word
7
Now
they
have
come
to
know
that
all
the
things
you
gave
me
are
from
you
8
because
I
have
given
them
the
sayings
that
you
gave
me
and
they
have
accepted
them
and
have
certainly
come
to
know
that
I
came
as
your
representative
and
they
have
believed
that
you
sent
me
9
I
make
request
concerning
them
I
make
request
not
concerning
the
world
but
concerning
those
whom
you
have
given
me
because
they
are
yours
10
and
all
my
things
are
yours
and
yours
are
mine
and
I
have
been
glorified
among
them
11
I
am
no
longer
in
the
world
but
they
are
in
the
world
and
I
am
coming
to
you
Holy
Father
watch
over
them
on
account
of
your
own
name
which
you
have
given
me
so
that
they
may
be
one
just
as
we
are
one
12
When
I
was
with
them
I
used
to
watch
over
them
on
account
of
your
own
name
which
you
have
given
me
and
I
have
protected
them
and
not
one
of
them
is
destroyed
except
the
son
of
destruction
so
that
the
scripture
might
be
fulfilled
13
But
now
I
am
coming
to
you
and
I
am
saying
these
things
in
the
world
so
that
they
may
have
my
joy
made
complete
in
themselves
14
I
have
given
your
word
to
them
but
the
world
has
hated
them
because
they
are
no
part
of
the
world
just
as
I
am
no
part
of
the
world
15
I
do
not
request
that
you
take
them
out
of
the
world
but
that
you
watch
over
them
because
of
the
wicked
one
16
They
are
no
part
of
the
world
just
as
I
am
no
part
of
the
world
17
Sanctify
them
by
means
of
the
truth
your
word
is
truth
18
Just
as
you
sent
me
into
the
world
I
also
sent
them
into
the
world
19
And
I
am
sanctifying
myself
in
their
behalf
so
that
they
also
may
be
sanctified
by
means
of
truth
20
I
make
request
not
concerning
these
only
but
also
concerning
those
putting
faith
in
me
through
their
word
21
so
that
they
may
all
be
one
just
as
you
Father
are
in
union
with
me
and
I
am
in
union
with
you
that
they
also
may
be
in
union
with
us
so
that
the
world
may
believe
that
you
sent
me
22
I
have
given
them
the
glory
that
you
have
given
me
in
order
that
they
may
be
one
just
as
we
are
one
23
I
in
union
with
them
and
you
in
union
with
me
in
order
that
they
may
be
perfected
into
one
so
that
the
world
may
know
that
you
sent
me
and
that
you
loved
them
just
as
you
loved
me
24
Father
I
want
those
whom
you
have
given
me
to
be
with
me
where
I
am
in
order
that
they
may
look
upon
my
glory
that
you
have
given
me
because
you
loved
me
before
the
founding
of
the
world
25
Righteous
Father
the
world
has
indeed
not
come
to
know
you
but
I
know
you
and
these
have
come
to
know
that
you
sent
me
26
I
have
made
your
name
known
to
them
and
will
make
it
known
so
that
the
love
with
which
you
loved
me
may
be
in
them
and
I
in
union
with
them
1
After
he
said
these
things
Jesus
went
out
with
his
disciples
across
the
Kidron
Valley
to
where
there
was
a
garden
and
he
and
his
disciples
went
into
it
2
Now
Judas
his
betrayer
also
knew
the
place
because
Jesus
had
often
met
there
with
his
disciples
3
So
Judas
brought
the
detachment
of
soldiers
and
officers
of
the
chief
priests
and
of
the
Pharisees
and
came
there
with
torches
and
lamps
and
weapons
4
Then
Jesus
knowing
all
the
things
that
were
going
to
happen
to
him
stepped
forward
and
said
to
them
Whom
are
you
looking
for
5
They
answered
him
Jesus
the
Nazarene
He
said
to
them
I
am
he
Now
Judas
his
betrayer
was
also
standing
with
them
6
However
when
Jesus
said
to
them
I
am
he

they
drew
back
and
fell
to
the
ground
7
So
he
asked
them
again
Whom
are
you
looking
for
They
said
Jesus
the
Nazarene
8
Jesus
answered
I
told
you
that
I
am
he
So
if
you
are
looking
for
me
let
these
men
go
9
This
was
to
fulfill
what
he
had
said
Of
those
whom
you
have
given
me
I
have
not
lost
a
single
one
10
Then
Simon
Peter
who
had
a
sword
drew
it
and
struck
the
slave
of
the
high
priest
cutting
off
his
right
ear
The
name
of
the
slave
was
Malchus
11
Jesus
however
said
to
Peter
Put
the
sword
into
its
sheath
Should
I
not
drink
the
cup
that
the
Father
has
given
me
12
Then
the
soldiers
and
the
military
commander
and
the
officers
of
the
Jews
seized
Jesus
and
bound
him
13
They
led
him
first
to
Annas
for
he
was
the
father-in-law
of
Caiaphas
who
was
high
priest
that
year
14
Caiaphas
was
in
fact
the
one
who
had
advised
the
Jews
that
it
was
to
their
benefit
for
one
man
to
die
in
behalf
of
the
people
15
Now
Simon
Peter
as
well
as
another
disciple
was
following
Jesus
That
disciple
was
known
to
the
high
priest
and
he
went
with
Jesus
into
the
courtyard
of
the
high
priest
16
but
Peter
was
standing
outside
at
the
door
So
the
other
disciple
who
was
known
to
the
high
priest
went
out
and
spoke
to
the
doorkeeper
and
brought
Peter
in
17
The
servant
girl
who
was
the
doorkeeper
then
said
to
Peter
You
are
not
also
one
of
this
mans
disciples
are
you
He
said
I
am
not
18
Now
the
slaves
and
the
officers
were
standing
around
a
charcoal
fire
they
had
made
because
it
was
cold
and
they
were
warming
themselves
Peter
also
was
standing
with
them
and
warming
himself
19
So
the
chief
priest
questioned
Jesus
about
his
disciples
and
about
his
teaching
20
Jesus
answered
him
I
have
spoken
to
the
world
publicly
I
always
taught
in
a
synagogue
and
in
the
temple
where
all
the
Jews
come
together
and
I
said
nothing
in
secret
21
Why
do
you
question
me
Question
those
who
have
heard
what
I
told
them
See
These
know
what
I
said
22
After
he
said
these
things
one
of
the
officers
who
was
standing
by
gave
Jesus
a
slap
in
the
face
and
said
Is
that
the
way
you
answer
the
chief
priest
23
Jesus
answered
him
If
I
said
something
wrong
bear
witness
about
the
wrong
but
if
what
I
said
was
right
why
do
you
hit
me
24
Then
Annas
sent
him
away
bound
to
Caiaphas
the
high
priest
25
Now
Simon
Peter
was
standing
there
warming
himself
Then
they
said
to
him
You
are
not
also
one
of
his
disciples
are
you
He
denied
it
and
said
I
am
not
26
One
of
the
slaves
of
the
high
priest
who
was
a
relative
of
the
man
whose
ear
Peter
had
cut
off
said
I
saw
you
in
the
garden
with
him
did
I
not
27
However
Peter
denied
it
again
and
immediately
a
rooster
crowed
28
Then
they
led
Jesus
from
Caiaphas
to
the
governors
residence
It
was
now
early
in
the
morning
But
they
themselves
did
not
enter
into
the
governors
residence
so
that
they
would
not
get
defiled
but
could
eat
the
Passover
29
So
Pilate
came
outside
to
them
and
said
What
accusation
do
you
bring
against
this
man
30
They
answered
him
If
this
man
were
not
a
wrongdoer
we
would
not
have
handed
him
over
to
you
31
So
Pilate
said
to
them
Take
him
yourselves
and
judge
him
according
to
your
law
The
Jews
said
to
him
It
is
not
lawful
for
us
to
kill
anyone
32
This
was
to
fulfill
the
word
that
Jesus
had
spoken
to
indicate
what
sort
of
death
he
was
about
to
die
33
So
Pilate
entered
the
governors
residence
again
and
called
Jesus
and
said
to
him
Are
you
the
King
of
the
Jews
34
Jesus
answered
Are
you
asking
this
of
your
own
originality
or
did
others
tell
you
about
me
35
Pilate
replied
I
am
not
a
Jew
am
I
Your
own
nation
and
the
chief
priests
handed
you
over
to
me
What
did
you
do
36
Jesus
answered
My
Kingdom
is
no
part
of
this
world
If
my
Kingdom
were
part
of
this
world
my
attendants
would
have
fought
that
I
should
not
be
handed
over
to
the
Jews
But
as
it
is
my
Kingdom
is
not
from
this
source
37
So
Pilate
said
to
him
Well
then
are
you
a
king
Jesus
answered
You
yourself
are
saying
that
I
am
a
king
For
this
I
have
been
born
and
for
this
I
have
come
into
the
world
that
I
should
bear
witness
to
the
truth
Everyone
who
is
on
the
side
of
the
truth
listens
to
my
voice
38
Pilate
said
to
him
What
is
truth
After
saying
this
he
went
out
again
to
the
Jews
and
said
to
them
I
find
no
fault
in
him
39
Moreover
you
have
a
custom
that
I
should
release
a
man
to
you
at
the
Passover
So
do
you
want
me
to
release
to
you
the
King
of
the
Jews
40
Again
they
shouted
Not
this
man
but
Barabbas
Now
Barabbas
was
a
robber
1
Pilate
then
took
Jesus
and
scourged
him
2
And
the
soldiers
braided
a
crown
of
thorns
and
put
it
on
his
head
and
clothed
him
with
a
purple
robe
3
and
they
kept
coming
up
to
him
and
saying
Greetings
you
King
of
the
Jews
They
also
kept
slapping
him
in
the
face
4
Pilate
went
outside
again
and
said
to
them
See
I
bring
him
outside
to
you
in
order
for
you
to
know
that
I
find
no
fault
in
him
5
So
Jesus
came
outside
wearing
the
crown
of
thorns
and
the
purple
robe
And
Pilate
said
to
them
Look
The
man
6
However
when
the
chief
priests
and
the
officers
saw
him
they
shouted
To
the
stake
with
him
To
the
stake
with
him
Pilate
said
to
them
Take
him
yourselves
and
execute
him
for
I
do
not
find
any
fault
in
him
7
The
Jews
answered
him
We
have
a
law
and
according
to
the
law
he
ought
to
die
because
he
made
himself
Gods
son
8
When
Pilate
heard
what
they
were
saying
he
became
even
more
fearful
9
and
he
entered
the
governors
residence
again
and
said
to
Jesus
Where
are
you
from
But
Jesus
gave
him
no
answer
10
So
Pilate
said
to
him
Are
you
refusing
to
speak
to
me
Do
you
not
know
that
I
have
authority
to
release
you
and
I
have
authority
to
execute
you
11
Jesus
answered
him
You
would
have
no
authority
over
me
at
all
unless
it
had
been
granted
to
you
from
above
This
is
why
the
man
who
handed
me
over
to
you
has
greater
sin
12
For
this
reason
Pilate
kept
trying
to
find
a
way
to
release
him
but
the
Jews
shouted
If
you
release
this
man
you
are
not
a
friend
of
Caesar
Everyone
who
makes
himself
a
king
speaks
against
Caesar
13
Then
Pilate
after
hearing
these
words
brought
Jesus
outside
and
he
sat
down
on
a
judgment
seat
in
a
place
called
the
Stone
Pavement
but
in
Hebrew
Gabbatha
14
Now
it
was
the
day
of
Preparation
of
the
Passover
it
was
about
the
sixth
hour
And
he
said
to
the
Jews
See
Your
king
15
However
they
shouted
Take
him
away
Take
him
away
To
the
stake
with
him
Pilate
said
to
them
Shall
I
execute
your
king
The
chief
priests
answered
We
have
no
king
but
Caesar
16
Then
he
handed
him
over
to
them
to
be
executed
on
the
stake
So
they
took
charge
of
Jesus
17
Bearing
the
torture
stake
for
himself
he
went
out
to
the
so-called
Skull
Place
which
is
called
Golgotha
in
Hebrew
18
There
they
nailed
him
to
the
stake
alongside
two
other
men
one
on
each
side
with
Jesus
in
the
middle
19
Pilate
also
wrote
a
title
and
put
it
on
the
torture
stake
It
was
written
Jesus
the
Nazarene
the
King
of
the
Jews
20
Many
of
the
Jews
read
this
title
because
the
place
where
Jesus
was
nailed
to
the
stake
was
near
the
city
and
it
was
written
in
Hebrew
in
Latin
and
in
Greek
21
However
the
chief
priests
of
the
Jews
said
to
Pilate
Do
not
write
The
King
of
the
Jews

but
that
he
said
I
am
King
of
the
Jews
22
Pilate
answered
What
I
have
written
I
have
written
23
Now
when
the
soldiers
had
nailed
Jesus
to
the
stake
they
took
his
outer
garments
and
divided
them
into
four
parts
one
for
each
soldier
and
they
also
took
the
inner
garment
But
the
inner
garment
was
without
a
seam
being
woven
from
top
to
bottom
24
So
they
said
to
one
another
Let
us
not
tear
it
but
let
us
cast
lots
over
it
to
decide
whose
it
will
be
This
was
to
fulfill
the
scripture
They
divided
my
garments
among
themselves
and
they
cast
lots
for
my
clothing
So
the
soldiers
actually
did
these
things
25
By
the
torture
stake
of
Jesus
however
there
were
standing
his
mother
and
his
mothers
sister
Mary
the
wife
of
Clopas
and
Mary
Magdalene
26
So
when
Jesus
saw
his
mother
and
the
disciple
whom
he
loved
standing
nearby
he
said
to
his
mother
Woman
see
Your
son
27
Next
he
said
to
the
disciple
See
Your
mother
And
from
that
hour
on
the
disciple
took
her
into
his
own
home
28
After
this
when
Jesus
knew
that
by
now
all
things
had
been
accomplished
in
order
to
fulfill
the
scripture
he
said
I
am
thirsty
29
A
jar
was
sitting
there
full
of
sour
wine
So
they
put
a
sponge
full
of
the
sour
wine
on
a
hyssop
stalk
and
held
it
up
to
his
mouth
30
When
he
had
received
the
sour
wine
Jesus
said
It
has
been
accomplished
and
bowing
his
head
he
gave
up
his
spirit
31
Since
it
was
the
day
of
Preparation
so
that
the
bodies
would
not
remain
on
the
torture
stakes
on
the
Sabbath
for
that
Sabbath
day
was
a
great
one
the
Jews
asked
Pilate
to
have
the
legs
broken
and
the
bodies
taken
away
32
So
the
soldiers
came
and
broke
the
legs
of
the
first
man
and
those
of
the
other
man
who
was
on
a
stake
alongside
him
33
But
on
coming
to
Jesus
they
saw
that
he
was
already
dead
so
they
did
not
break
his
legs
34
But
one
of
the
soldiers
jabbed
his
side
with
a
spear
and
immediately
blood
and
water
came
out
35
And
the
one
who
has
seen
it
has
given
this
witness
and
his
witness
is
true
and
he
knows
that
what
he
says
is
true
so
that
you
also
may
believe
36
In
fact
these
things
took
place
for
the
scripture
to
be
fulfilled
Not
a
bone
of
his
will
be
broken
37
And
again
a
different
scripture
says
They
will
look
to
the
one
whom
they
pierced
38
Now
after
these
things
Joseph
of
Arimathea
who
was
a
disciple
of
Jesus
but
a
secret
one
because
of
his
fear
of
the
Jews
asked
Pilate
if
he
could
take
away
the
body
of
Jesus
and
Pilate
gave
him
permission
So
he
came
and
took
the
body
away
39
Nicodemus
the
man
who
had
come
to
him
in
the
night
the
first
time
also
came
bringing
a
mixture
of
myrrh
and
aloes
weighing
about
a
hundred
pounds
40
So
they
took
the
body
of
Jesus
and
wrapped
it
in
linen
cloths
with
the
spices
according
to
the
burial
custom
of
the
Jews
41
Incidentally
there
was
a
garden
at
the
place
where
he
was
executed
and
in
the
garden
was
a
new
tomb
in
which
no
one
had
ever
yet
been
laid
42
Because
it
was
the
day
of
Preparation
of
the
Jews
and
the
tomb
was
nearby
they
laid
Jesus
there
1
On
the
first
day
of
the
week
Mary
Magdalene
came
to
the
tomb
early
while
it
was
still
dark
and
she
saw
that
the
stone
had
already
been
taken
away
from
the
tomb
2
So
she
came
running
to
Simon
Peter
and
to
the
other
disciple
for
whom
Jesus
had
affection
and
she
said
to
them
They
have
taken
away
the
Lord
out
of
the
tomb
and
we
do
not
know
where
they
have
laid
him
3
Then
Peter
and
the
other
disciple
set
out
for
the
tomb
4
The
two
of
them
began
running
together
but
the
other
disciple
ran
faster
than
Peter
and
reached
the
tomb
first
5
Stooping
forward
he
saw
the
linen
cloths
lying
there
but
he
did
not
go
in
6
Then
Simon
Peter
also
came
following
him
and
he
went
into
the
tomb
And
he
saw
the
linen
cloths
lying
there
7
The
cloth
that
had
been
on
his
head
was
not
lying
with
the
other
cloth
bands
but
was
rolled
up
in
a
place
by
itself
8
Then
the
other
disciple
who
had
reached
the
tomb
first
also
went
in
and
he
saw
and
believed
9
For
they
did
not
yet
understand
the
scripture
that
he
must
rise
from
the
dead
10
So
the
disciples
went
back
to
their
homes
11
Mary
however
kept
standing
outside
near
the
tomb
weeping
While
she
was
weeping
she
stooped
forward
to
look
into
the
tomb
12
and
she
saw
two
angels
in
white
sitting
where
the
body
of
Jesus
had
been
lying
one
at
the
head
and
one
at
the
feet
13
And
they
said
to
her
Woman
why
are
you
weeping
She
said
to
them
They
have
taken
my
Lord
away
and
I
do
not
know
where
they
have
laid
him
14
After
saying
this
she
turned
around
and
saw
Jesus
standing
there
but
she
did
not
realize
that
it
was
Jesus
15
Jesus
said
to
her
Woman
why
are
you
weeping
Whom
are
you
looking
for
She
thinking
it
was
the
gardener
said
to
him
Sir
if
you
have
carried
him
off
tell
me
where
you
have
laid
him
and
I
will
take
him
away
16
Jesus
said
to
her
Mary
On
turning
around
she
said
to
him
in
Hebrew
Rabboni
which
means
Teacher
17
Jesus
said
to
her
Stop
clinging
to
me
for
I
have
not
yet
ascended
to
the
Father
But
go
to
my
brothers
and
say
to
them
I
am
ascending
to
my
Father
and
your
Father
and
to
my
God
and
your
God
18
Mary
Magdalene
came
and
brought
the
news
to
the
disciples
I
have
seen
the
Lord
And
she
told
them
what
he
had
said
to
her
19
When
it
was
late
that
day
the
first
day
of
the
week
and
the
doors
were
locked
where
the
disciples
were
for
fear
of
the
Jews
Jesus
came
and
stood
in
their
midst
and
said
to
them
May
you
have
peace
20
After
saying
this
he
showed
them
his
hands
and
his
side
Then
the
disciples
rejoiced
at
seeing
the
Lord
21
Jesus
said
to
them
again
May
you
have
peace
Just
as
the
Father
has
sent
me
I
also
am
sending
you
22
After
saying
this
he
blew
on
them
and
said
to
them
Receive
holy
spirit
23
If
you
forgive
the
sins
of
anyone
they
are
forgiven
if
you
retain
those
of
anyone
they
are
retained
24
But
Thomas
one
of
the
Twelve
who
was
called
the
Twin
was
not
with
them
when
Jesus
came
25
So
the
other
disciples
were
telling
him
We
have
seen
the
Lord
But
he
said
to
them
Unless
I
see
in
his
hands
the
print
of
the
nails
and
stick
my
finger
into
the
print
of
the
nails
and
stick
my
hand
into
his
side
I
will
never
believe
it
26
Well
eight
days
later
his
disciples
were
again
indoors
and
Thomas
was
with
them
Jesus
came
although
the
doors
were
locked
and
he
stood
in
their
midst
and
said
May
you
have
peace
27
Next
he
said
to
Thomas
Put
your
finger
here
and
see
my
hands
and
take
your
hand
and
stick
it
into
my
side
and
stop
doubting
but
believe
28
In
answer
Thomas
said
to
him
My
Lord
and
my
God
29
Jesus
said
to
him
Because
you
have
seen
me
have
you
believed
Happy
are
those
who
have
not
seen
and
yet
believe
30
To
be
sure
Jesus
also
performed
many
other
signs
before
the
disciples
which
are
not
written
down
in
this
scroll
31
But
these
have
been
written
down
so
that
you
may
believe
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
the
Son
of
God
and
because
of
believing
you
may
have
life
by
means
of
his
name
1
After
this
Jesus
manifested
himself
again
to
the
disciples
at
the
Sea
of
Tiberias
He
made
the
manifestation
in
this
way
2
There
were
together
Simon
Peter
Thomas
who
was
called
the
Twin
Nathanael
from
Cana
of
Galilee
the
sons
of
Zebedee
and
two
others
of
his
disciples
3
Simon
Peter
said
to
them
I
am
going
fishing
They
said
to
him
We
are
coming
with
you
They
went
out
and
got
aboard
the
boat
but
during
that
night
they
caught
nothing
4
However
just
as
day
was
breaking
Jesus
stood
on
the
beach
but
the
disciples
did
not
realize
that
it
was
Jesus
5
Then
Jesus
said
to
them
Children
you
do
not
have
anything
to
eat
do
you
They
answered
No
6
He
said
to
them
Cast
the
net
on
the
right
side
of
the
boat
and
you
will
find
some
So
they
cast
it
but
they
were
not
able
to
haul
it
in
because
of
the
large
number
of
fish
7
Then
the
disciple
whom
Jesus
loved
said
to
Peter
It
is
the
Lord
Now
Simon
Peter
on
hearing
that
it
was
the
Lord
put
on
his
outer
garment
for
he
was
naked
and
plunged
into
the
sea
8
But
the
other
disciples
came
in
the
small
boat
dragging
the
net
full
of
fish
for
they
were
not
a
long
way
from
land
only
about
300
feet
away
9
When
they
came
ashore
they
saw
there
a
charcoal
fire
with
fish
lying
on
it
and
bread
10
Jesus
said
to
them
Bring
some
of
the
fish
you
just
now
caught
11
So
Simon
Peter
went
on
board
and
hauled
the
net
ashore
full
of
big
fish
153
of
them
And
though
there
were
so
many
the
net
did
not
burst
12
Jesus
said
to
them
Come
have
your
breakfast
Not
one
of
the
disciples
had
the
courage
to
ask
him
Who
are
you
because
they
knew
it
was
the
Lord
13
Jesus
came
and
took
the
bread
and
gave
it
to
them
and
the
same
with
the
fish
14
This
was
now
the
third
time
that
Jesus
appeared
to
the
disciples
after
being
raised
up
from
the
dead
15
When
they
had
finished
breakfast
Jesus
said
to
Simon
Peter
Simon
son
of
John
do
you
love
me
more
than
these
He
replied
to
him
Yes
Lord
you
know
I
have
affection
for
you
He
said
to
him
Feed
my
lambs
16
Again
he
said
to
him
a
second
time
Simon
son
of
John
do
you
love
me
He
replied
Yes
Lord
you
know
I
have
affection
for
you
He
said
to
him
Shepherd
my
little
sheep
17
He
said
to
him
a
third
time
Simon
son
of
John
do
you
have
affection
for
me
Peter
became
grieved
that
he
asked
him
the
third
time
Do
you
have
affection
for
me
So
he
said
to
him
Lord
you
are
aware
of
all
things
you
know
that
I
have
affection
for
you
Jesus
said
to
him
Feed
my
little
sheep
18
Most
truly
I
say
to
you
when
you
were
younger
you
used
to
clothe
yourself
and
walk
about
where
you
wanted
But
when
you
grow
old
you
will
stretch
out
your
hands
and
another
man
will
clothe
you
and
carry
you
where
you
do
not
wish
19
He
said
this
to
indicate
by
what
sort
of
death
he
would
glorify
God
After
he
said
this
he
said
to
him
Continue
following
me
20
Peter
turned
around
and
saw
the
disciple
whom
Jesus
loved
following
the
one
who
at
the
evening
meal
had
also
leaned
back
on
his
chest
and
said
Lord
who
is
the
one
betraying
you
21
So
when
he
caught
sight
of
him
Peter
said
to
Jesus
Lord
what
about
this
man
22
Jesus
said
to
him
If
it
is
my
will
for
him
to
remain
until
I
come
of
what
concern
is
that
to
you
You
continue
following
me
23
So
the
saying
went
out
among
the
brothers
that
this
disciple
would
not
die
However
Jesus
did
not
say
to
him
that
he
would
not
die
but
he
said
If
it
is
my
will
for
him
to
remain
until
I
come
of
what
concern
is
that
to
you
24
This
is
the
disciple
who
gives
this
witness
about
these
things
and
who
wrote
these
things
and
we
know
that
his
witness
is
true
25
There
are
also
in
fact
many
other
things
that
Jesus
did
which
if
ever
they
were
written
in
full
detail
I
suppose
the
world
itself
could
not
contain
the
scrolls
written
1
The
first
account
O
Theophilus
I
composed
about
all
the
things
Jesus
started
to
do
and
to
teach
2
until
the
day
that
he
was
taken
up
after
he
had
given
instructions
through
holy
spirit
to
the
apostles
he
had
chosen
3
After
he
had
suffered
he
showed
himself
alive
to
them
by
many
convincing
proofs
He
was
seen
by
them
throughout
40
days
and
he
was
speaking
about
the
Kingdom
of
God
4
While
he
was
meeting
with
them
he
ordered
them
Do
not
leave
Jerusalem
but
keep
waiting
for
what
the
Father
has
promised
about
which
you
heard
from
me
5
for
John
indeed
baptized
with
water
but
you
will
be
baptized
with
holy
spirit
not
many
days
after
this
6
So
when
they
had
assembled
they
asked
him
Lord
are
you
restoring
the
kingdom
to
Israel
at
this
time
7
He
said
to
them
It
does
not
belong
to
you
to
know
the
times
or
seasons
that
the
Father
has
placed
in
his
own
jurisdiction
8
But
you
will
receive
power
when
the
holy
spirit
comes
upon
you
and
you
will
be
witnesses
of
me
in
Jerusalem
in
all
Judea
and
Samaria
and
to
the
most
distant
part
of
the
earth
9
After
he
had
said
these
things
while
they
were
looking
on
he
was
lifted
up
and
a
cloud
caught
him
up
from
their
sight
10
And
as
they
were
gazing
into
the
sky
while
he
was
on
his
way
suddenly
two
men
in
white
garments
stood
beside
them
11
and
said
Men
of
Galilee
why
do
you
stand
looking
into
the
sky
This
Jesus
who
was
taken
up
from
you
into
the
sky
will
come
in
the
same
manner
as
you
have
seen
him
going
into
the
sky
12
Then
they
returned
to
Jerusalem
from
a
mountain
called
the
Mount
of
Olives
which
is
near
Jerusalem
only
a
sabbath
days
journey
away
13
When
they
arrived
they
went
up
into
the
upper
room
where
they
were
staying
There
were
Peter
as
well
as
John
and
James
and
Andrew
Philip
and
Thomas
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
James
the
son
of
Alphaeus
and
Simon
the
zealous
one
and
Judas
the
son
of
James
14
With
one
purpose
all
of
these
were
persisting
in
prayer
together
with
some
women
and
Mary
the
mother
of
Jesus
and
with
his
brothers
15
During
those
days
Peter
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
brothers
the
number
of
people
was
altogether
about
120
and
said
16
Men
brothers
it
was
necessary
for
the
scripture
to
be
fulfilled
that
the
holy
spirit
spoke
prophetically
through
David
about
Judas
who
became
a
guide
to
those
who
arrested
Jesus
17
For
he
had
been
numbered
among
us
and
he
obtained
a
share
in
this
ministry
18
This
very
man
therefore
purchased
a
field
with
the
wages
for
unrighteousness
and
falling
headfirst
his
body
burst
open
and
all
his
insides
spilled
out
19
This
became
known
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
so
that
the
field
was
called
in
their
language
Akeldama
that
is
Field
of
Blood
20
For
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
Psalms
Let
his
dwelling
become
desolate
and
let
there
be
no
inhabitant
in
it
and
His
office
of
oversight
let
someone
else
take
21
It
is
therefore
necessary
that
of
the
men
who
accompanied
us
during
all
the
time
in
which
the
Lord
Jesus
carried
on
his
activities
among
us
22
starting
with
his
baptism
by
John
until
the
day
he
was
taken
up
from
us
one
of
these
men
should
become
a
witness
with
us
of
his
resurrection
23
So
they
proposed
two
Joseph
called
Barsabbas
who
was
also
called
Justus
and
Matthias
24
Then
they
prayed
and
said
You
O
Jehovah
who
know
the
hearts
of
all
designate
which
one
of
these
two
men
you
have
chosen
25
to
take
the
place
of
this
ministry
and
apostleship
from
which
Judas
deviated
to
go
to
his
own
place
26
So
they
cast
lots
over
them
and
the
lot
fell
to
Matthias
and
he
was
counted
along
with
the
11
apostles
1
Now
while
the
day
of
the
Festival
of
Pentecost
was
in
progress
they
were
all
together
at
the
same
place
2
Suddenly
there
was
a
noise
from
heaven
just
like
that
of
a
rushing
stiff
breeze
and
it
filled
the
whole
house
where
they
were
sitting
3
And
tongues
as
if
of
fire
became
visible
to
them
and
were
distributed
and
one
came
to
rest
on
each
one
of
them
4
and
they
all
became
filled
with
holy
spirit
and
started
to
speak
in
different
languages
just
as
the
spirit
enabled
them
to
speak
5
At
that
time
devout
Jews
from
every
nation
under
heaven
were
staying
in
Jerusalem
6
So
when
this
sound
occurred
a
crowd
gathered
and
was
bewildered
because
each
one
heard
them
speaking
in
his
own
language
7
Indeed
they
were
utterly
amazed
and
said
See
here
all
these
who
are
speaking
are
Galileans
are
they
not
8
How
is
it
then
that
each
one
of
us
is
hearing
his
own
native
language
9
Parthians
Medes
and
Elamites
the
inhabitants
of
Mesopotamia
Judea
and
Cappadocia
Pontus
and
the
province
of
Asia
10
Phrygia
and
Pamphylia
Egypt
and
the
regions
of
Libya
near
Cyrene
sojourners
from
Rome
both
Jews
and
proselytes
11
Cretans
and
Arabians—we
hear
them
speaking
in
our
languages
about
the
magnificent
things
of
God
12
Yes
they
were
all
astonished
and
perplexed
saying
to
one
another
What
does
this
mean
13
However
others
mocked
them
and
said
They
are
full
of
sweet
wine
14
But
Peter
stood
up
with
the
Eleven
and
spoke
to
them
in
a
loud
voice
Men
of
Judea
and
all
you
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
let
this
be
known
to
you
and
listen
carefully
to
my
words
15
These
people
are
in
fact
not
drunk
as
you
suppose
for
it
is
the
third
hour
of
the
day
16
On
the
contrary
this
is
what
was
said
through
the
prophet
Joel
17
And
in
the
last
days

God
says
I
will
pour
out
some
of
my
spirit
on
every
sort
of
flesh
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
will
prophesy
and
your
young
men
will
see
visions
and
your
old
men
will
dream
dreams
18
and
even
on
my
male
slaves
and
on
my
female
slaves
I
will
pour
out
some
of
my
spirit
in
those
days
and
they
will
prophesy
19
And
I
will
give
wonders
in
heaven
above
and
signs
on
earth
below—blood
and
fire
and
clouds
of
smoke
20
The
sun
will
be
turned
into
darkness
and
the
moon
into
blood
before
the
great
and
illustrious
day
of
Jehovah
comes
21
And
everyone
who
calls
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
will
be
saved
22
Men
of
Israel
hear
these
words
Jesus
the
Nazarene
was
a
man
publicly
shown
to
you
by
God
through
powerful
works
and
wonders
and
signs
that
God
did
through
him
in
your
midst
just
as
you
yourselves
know
23
This
man
who
was
handed
over
by
the
determined
will
and
foreknowledge
of
God
you
fastened
to
a
stake
by
the
hand
of
lawless
men
and
you
did
away
with
him
24
But
God
resurrected
him
by
releasing
him
from
the
pangs
of
death
because
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
be
held
fast
by
it
25
For
David
says
about
him
I
keep
Jehovah
constantly
in
front
of
me
for
he
is
at
my
right
hand
that
I
may
never
be
shaken
26
On
this
account
my
heart
became
cheerful
and
my
tongue
rejoiced
greatly
And
I
will
reside
in
hope
27
because
you
will
not
leave
me
in
the
Grave
nor
will
you
allow
your
loyal
one
to
see
corruption
28
You
have
made
lifes
ways
known
to
me
you
will
fill
me
with
great
joy
in
your
presence
29
Men
brothers
it
is
permissible
to
speak
with
freeness
of
speech
to
you
about
the
family
head
David
that
he
died
and
was
buried
and
his
tomb
is
with
us
to
this
day
30
Because
he
was
a
prophet
and
knew
that
God
had
sworn
to
him
with
an
oath
that
he
would
seat
one
of
his
offspring
on
his
throne
31
he
foresaw
and
spoke
about
the
resurrection
of
the
Christ
that
neither
was
he
forsaken
in
the
Grave
nor
did
his
flesh
see
corruption
32
God
resurrected
this
Jesus
and
of
this
we
are
all
witnesses
33
Therefore
because
he
was
exalted
to
the
right
hand
of
God
and
received
the
promised
holy
spirit
from
the
Father
he
has
poured
out
what
you
see
and
hear
34
For
David
did
not
ascend
to
the
heavens
but
he
himself
says
Jehovah
said
to
my
Lord
Sit
at
my
right
hand
35
until
I
place
your
enemies
as
a
stool
for
your
feet
36
Therefore
let
all
the
house
of
Israel
know
for
a
certainty
that
God
made
him
both
Lord
and
Christ
this
Jesus
whom
you
executed
on
a
stake
37
Now
when
they
heard
this
they
were
stabbed
to
the
heart
and
they
said
to
Peter
and
the
rest
of
the
apostles
Men
brothers
what
should
we
do
38
Peter
said
to
them
Repent
and
let
each
one
of
you
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
for
forgiveness
of
your
sins
and
you
will
receive
the
free
gift
of
the
holy
spirit
39
For
the
promise
is
to
you
and
your
children
and
to
all
those
who
are
far
away
to
all
those
whom
Jehovah
our
God
may
call
to
himself
40
And
with
many
other
words
he
gave
a
thorough
witness
and
kept
exhorting
them
saying
Get
saved
from
this
crooked
generation
41
So
those
who
gladly
accepted
his
word
were
baptized
and
on
that
day
about
3000
people
were
added
42
And
they
continued
devoting
themselves
to
the
teaching
of
the
apostles
to
associating
together
to
the
taking
of
meals
and
to
prayers
43
Indeed
fear
began
to
fall
upon
everyone
and
many
wonders
and
signs
began
to
occur
through
the
apostles
44
All
those
who
became
believers
were
together
and
had
everything
in
common
45
and
they
were
selling
their
possessions
and
properties
and
distributing
the
proceeds
to
all
according
to
what
each
one
needed
46
And
day
after
day
they
were
in
constant
attendance
in
the
temple
with
a
united
purpose
and
they
took
their
meals
in
different
homes
and
shared
their
food
with
great
rejoicing
and
sincerity
of
heart
47
praising
God
and
finding
favor
with
all
the
people
At
the
same
time
Jehovah
continued
to
add
to
them
daily
those
being
saved
1
Now
Peter
and
John
were
going
up
into
the
temple
for
the
hour
of
prayer
the
ninth
hour
2
and
a
man
who
was
lame
from
birth
was
being
carried
Every
day
they
would
put
him
near
the
temple
door
that
was
called
Beautiful
so
he
could
ask
for
gifts
of
mercy
from
those
entering
the
temple
3
When
he
caught
sight
of
Peter
and
John
about
to
go
into
the
temple
he
began
asking
for
gifts
of
mercy
4
But
Peter
together
with
John
looked
straight
at
him
and
said
Look
at
us
5
So
he
fixed
his
attention
on
them
expecting
to
get
something
from
them
6
However
Peter
said
Silver
and
gold
I
do
not
possess
but
what
I
do
have
is
what
I
give
you
In
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
the
Nazarene
walk
7
With
that
he
took
hold
of
him
by
the
right
hand
and
raised
him
up
Instantly
his
feet
and
his
ankles
were
made
firm
8
and
leaping
to
his
feet
he
began
walking
and
went
with
them
into
the
temple
walking
and
leaping
and
praising
God
9
And
all
the
people
saw
him
walking
and
praising
God
10
And
they
began
to
recognize
him
that
this
was
the
man
who
used
to
sit
waiting
for
gifts
of
mercy
at
the
Beautiful
Gate
of
the
temple
and
they
were
completely
astonished
and
ecstatic
about
what
had
happened
to
him
11
While
the
man
was
still
holding
on
to
Peter
and
John
all
the
people
ran
together
to
them
at
what
was
called
Solomons
Colonnade
completely
surprised
12
When
Peter
saw
this
he
said
to
the
people
Men
of
Israel
why
are
you
so
amazed
at
this
and
why
are
you
staring
at
us
as
though
by
personal
power
or
godly
devotion
we
have
made
him
walk
13
The
God
of
Abraham
and
of
Isaac
and
of
Jacob
the
God
of
our
forefathers
has
glorified
his
Servant
Jesus
whom
you
handed
over
and
disowned
before
Pilate
even
though
he
had
decided
to
release
him
14
Yes
you
disowned
that
holy
and
righteous
one
and
you
asked
for
a
man
who
was
a
murderer
to
be
given
to
you
15
whereas
you
killed
the
Chief
Agent
of
life
But
God
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
of
which
fact
we
are
witnesses
16
And
through
his
name
and
by
our
faith
in
his
name
this
man
whom
you
see
and
know
has
been
made
strong
The
faith
that
is
through
him
has
made
this
man
completely
healthy
in
front
of
all
of
you
17
And
now
brothers
I
know
that
you
acted
in
ignorance
just
as
your
rulers
also
did
18
But
in
this
way
God
has
fulfilled
the
things
he
announced
beforehand
through
the
mouth
of
all
the
prophets
that
his
Christ
would
suffer
19
Repent
therefore
and
turn
around
so
as
to
get
your
sins
blotted
out
so
that
seasons
of
refreshing
may
come
from
Jehovah
himself
20
and
he
may
send
the
Christ
appointed
for
you
Jesus
21
Heaven
must
hold
this
one
within
itself
until
the
times
of
restoration
of
all
things
of
which
God
spoke
through
the
mouth
of
his
holy
prophets
of
old
22
In
fact
Moses
said
Jehovah
your
God
will
raise
up
for
you
from
among
your
brothers
a
prophet
like
me
You
must
listen
to
whatever
he
tells
you
23
Indeed
anyone
who
does
not
listen
to
that
Prophet
will
be
completely
destroyed
from
among
the
people
24
And
all
the
prophets
from
Samuel
and
those
who
followed
him
as
many
as
have
spoken
have
also
plainly
declared
these
days
25
You
are
the
sons
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
covenant
that
God
made
with
your
forefathers
saying
to
Abraham
And
by
means
of
your
offspring
all
the
families
of
the
earth
will
be
blessed
26
God
after
raising
up
his
Servant
sent
him
to
you
first
to
bless
you
by
turning
each
one
of
you
away
from
your
wicked
deeds
1
While
the
two
were
speaking
to
the
people
the
priests
the
captain
of
the
temple
and
the
Sadducees
came
up
to
them
2
These
were
annoyed
because
the
apostles
were
teaching
the
people
and
were
openly
declaring
the
resurrection
of
Jesus
from
the
dead
3
So
they
seized
them
and
took
them
into
custody
until
the
next
day
for
it
was
already
evening
4
However
many
of
those
who
had
listened
to
the
speech
believed
and
the
number
of
the
men
became
about
5000
5
The
next
day
their
rulers
elders
and
scribes
gathered
together
in
Jerusalem
6
along
with
Annas
the
chief
priest
Caiaphas
John
Alexander
and
all
who
were
relatives
of
the
chief
priest
7
They
stood
Peter
and
John
in
their
midst
and
began
to
question
them
By
what
power
or
in
whose
name
did
you
do
this
8
Then
Peter
filled
with
holy
spirit
said
to
them
Rulers
of
the
people
and
elders
9
if
we
are
being
examined
today
about
a
good
deed
to
a
crippled
man
and
you
want
to
know
who
made
this
man
well
10
let
it
be
known
to
all
of
you
and
to
all
the
people
of
Israel
that
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
the
Nazarene
whom
you
executed
on
a
stake
but
whom
God
raised
up
from
the
dead
by
means
of
him
this
man
stands
here
healthy
in
front
of
you
11
This
is
the
stone
that
was
treated
by
you
builders
as
of
no
account
that
has
become
the
chief
cornerstone
12
Furthermore
there
is
no
salvation
in
anyone
else
for
there
is
no
other
name
under
heaven
that
has
been
given
among
men
by
which
we
must
get
saved
13
Now
when
they
saw
the
outspokenness
of
Peter
and
John
and
perceived
that
they
were
uneducated
and
ordinary
men
they
were
astonished
And
they
began
to
realize
that
they
had
been
with
Jesus
14
As
they
were
looking
at
the
man
who
had
been
cured
standing
with
them
they
had
nothing
to
say
in
answer
to
this
15
So
they
commanded
them
to
go
outside
the
Sanhedrin
hall
and
they
began
consulting
with
one
another
16
saying
What
should
we
do
with
these
men
Because
for
a
fact
a
noteworthy
sign
has
occurred
through
them
one
evident
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
and
we
cannot
deny
it
17
So
that
this
does
not
spread
any
further
among
the
people
let
us
threaten
them
and
tell
them
not
to
speak
to
anyone
anymore
on
the
basis
of
this
name
18
With
that
they
called
them
and
ordered
them
not
to
say
anything
at
all
or
to
teach
on
the
basis
of
the
name
of
Jesus
19
But
in
reply
Peter
and
John
said
to
them
Whether
it
is
right
in
the
sight
of
God
to
listen
to
you
rather
than
to
God
judge
for
yourselves
20
But
as
for
us
we
cannot
stop
speaking
about
the
things
we
have
seen
and
heard
21
So
after
they
had
threatened
them
further
they
released
them
since
they
did
not
find
any
grounds
for
punishing
them
and
on
account
of
the
people
because
they
were
all
glorifying
God
over
what
had
happened
22
For
the
man
on
whom
this
miracle
of
healing
had
been
done
was
more
than
40
years
old
23
After
being
released
they
went
to
their
own
people
and
reported
what
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
had
said
to
them
24
On
hearing
this
they
raised
their
voices
with
one
accord
to
God
and
said
Sovereign
Lord
you
are
the
One
who
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
the
things
in
them
25
and
who
said
through
holy
spirit
by
the
mouth
of
our
forefather
David
your
servant
Why
did
nations
become
agitated
and
peoples
meditate
on
empty
things
26
The
kings
of
the
earth
took
their
stand
and
the
rulers
gathered
together
as
one
against
Jehovah
and
against
his
anointed
one
27
For
truly
both
Herod
and
Pontius
Pilate
with
men
of
the
nations
and
with
peoples
of
Israel
were
gathered
together
in
this
city
against
your
holy
servant
Jesus
whom
you
anointed
28
to
do
what
your
hand
and
counsel
had
determined
beforehand
to
occur
29
And
now
Jehovah
give
attention
to
their
threats
and
grant
to
your
slaves
to
keep
speaking
your
word
with
all
boldness
30
while
you
stretch
out
your
hand
for
healing
and
while
signs
and
wonders
occur
through
the
name
of
your
holy
servant
Jesus
31
And
when
they
had
made
supplication
the
place
where
they
were
gathered
together
was
shaken
and
they
were
one
and
all
filled
with
the
holy
spirit
and
were
speaking
the
word
of
God
with
boldness
32
Moreover
the
multitude
of
those
who
believed
were
of
one
heart
and
soul
and
not
even
one
of
them
would
say
that
any
of
the
things
he
possessed
was
his
own
but
they
had
all
things
in
common
33
And
with
great
power
the
apostles
continued
giving
the
witness
about
the
resurrection
of
the
Lord
Jesus
and
undeserved
kindness
was
upon
them
all
in
large
measure
34
In
fact
no
one
was
in
need
among
them
for
all
those
who
owned
fields
or
houses
would
sell
them
and
bring
the
value
of
what
was
sold
35
and
they
would
deposit
it
at
the
feet
of
the
apostles
In
turn
distribution
would
be
made
to
each
one
according
to
his
need
36
So
Joseph
who
was
also
called
by
the
apostles
Barnabas
which
means
when
translated
Son
of
Comfort
a
Levite
a
native
of
Cyprus
37
owned
a
piece
of
land
and
he
sold
it
and
brought
the
money
and
deposited
it
at
the
feet
of
the
apostles
1
However
a
man
named
Ananias
together
with
his
wife
Sapphira
sold
some
property
2
But
he
secretly
held
back
some
of
the
price
with
his
wifes
knowledge
and
he
brought
just
a
part
of
it
and
deposited
it
at
the
feet
of
the
apostles
3
But
Peter
said
Ananias
why
has
Satan
emboldened
you
to
lie
to
the
holy
spirit
and
secretly
hold
back
some
of
the
price
of
the
field
4
As
long
as
it
remained
with
you
did
it
not
remain
yours
And
after
it
was
sold
was
it
not
in
your
control
Why
have
you
thought
up
such
a
deed
as
this
in
your
heart
You
have
lied
not
to
men
but
to
God
5
On
hearing
these
words
Ananias
collapsed
and
died
And
great
fear
came
over
all
those
who
heard
about
it
6
Then
the
younger
men
rose
wrapped
him
in
cloths
carried
him
out
and
buried
him
7
Now
after
an
interval
of
about
three
hours
his
wife
came
in
not
knowing
what
had
happened
8
Peter
said
to
her
Tell
me
did
you
two
sell
the
field
for
so
much
She
said
Yes
for
that
amount
9
So
Peter
said
to
her
Why
did
you
two
agree
to
make
a
test
of
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
Look
The
feet
of
those
who
buried
your
husband
are
at
the
door
and
they
will
carry
you
out
10
Instantly
she
collapsed
at
his
feet
and
died
When
the
young
men
came
in
they
found
her
dead
and
they
carried
her
out
and
buried
her
alongside
her
husband
11
So
great
fear
came
over
the
whole
congregation
and
over
all
those
hearing
about
these
things
12
Moreover
through
the
hands
of
the
apostles
many
signs
and
wonders
continued
to
occur
among
the
people
and
they
would
all
meet
together
in
Solomons
Colonnade
13
True
none
of
the
others
had
the
courage
to
join
them
nevertheless
the
people
were
speaking
highly
of
them
14
More
than
that
believers
in
the
Lord
kept
on
being
added
great
numbers
both
of
men
and
of
women
15
They
even
brought
the
sick
out
into
the
main
streets
and
laid
them
there
on
small
beds
and
mats
so
that
as
Peter
would
pass
by
at
least
his
shadow
might
fall
on
some
of
them
16
Also
crowds
of
people
from
the
cities
around
Jerusalem
kept
coming
carrying
sick
people
and
those
troubled
with
unclean
spirits
and
they
were
one
and
all
cured
17
But
the
high
priest
rose
and
all
those
with
him
who
were
of
the
sect
of
the
Sadducees
and
they
were
filled
with
jealousy
18
And
they
seized
the
apostles
and
put
them
in
the
public
jail
19
But
during
the
night
Jehovahs
angel
opened
the
doors
of
the
prison
brought
them
out
and
said
20
Go
and
take
your
stand
in
the
temple
and
keep
on
speaking
to
the
people
all
the
sayings
about
this
life
21
After
hearing
this
they
entered
the
temple
at
daybreak
and
began
to
teach
Now
when
the
high
priest
and
those
with
him
arrived
they
called
together
the
Sanhedrin
and
the
entire
assembly
of
elders
of
the
sons
of
Israel
and
they
sent
out
to
the
jail
to
have
the
apostles
brought
before
them
22
But
when
the
officers
got
there
they
did
not
find
them
in
the
prison
So
they
returned
and
made
their
report
23
saying
We
found
the
jail
locked
and
secure
and
the
guards
were
standing
at
the
doors
but
on
opening
it
up
we
found
no
one
inside
24
Well
when
both
the
captain
of
the
temple
and
the
chief
priests
heard
these
words
they
were
perplexed
about
what
would
come
of
this
25
But
someone
came
and
reported
to
them
Look
The
men
you
put
in
prison
are
in
the
temple
standing
and
teaching
the
people
26
Then
the
captain
went
off
with
his
officers
and
brought
them
in
but
without
violence
because
they
were
afraid
of
being
stoned
by
the
people
27
So
they
brought
them
and
stood
them
before
the
Sanhedrin
Then
the
high
priest
questioned
them
28
and
said
We
strictly
ordered
you
not
to
keep
teaching
on
the
basis
of
this
name
and
yet
look
you
have
filled
Jerusalem
with
your
teaching
and
you
are
determined
to
bring
the
blood
of
this
man
upon
us
29
In
answer
Peter
and
the
other
apostles
said
We
must
obey
God
as
ruler
rather
than
men
30
The
God
of
our
forefathers
raised
up
Jesus
whom
you
killed
hanging
him
on
a
stake
31
God
exalted
this
one
as
Chief
Agent
and
Savior
to
his
right
hand
to
give
repentance
to
Israel
and
forgiveness
of
sins
32
And
we
are
witnesses
of
these
matters
and
so
is
the
holy
spirit
which
God
has
given
to
those
obeying
him
as
ruler
33
When
they
heard
this
they
were
infuriated
and
wanted
to
do
away
with
them
34
But
a
Pharisee
named
Gamaliel
rose
in
the
Sanhedrin
he
was
a
Law
teacher
esteemed
by
all
the
people
and
he
gave
the
command
to
put
the
men
outside
for
a
little
while
35
Then
he
said
to
them
Men
of
Israel
be
careful
as
to
what
you
intend
to
do
about
these
men
36
For
instance
before
these
days
Theudas
rose
up
saying
he
himself
was
somebody
and
a
number
of
men
about
400
joined
his
party
But
he
was
done
away
with
and
all
those
who
were
following
him
were
dispersed
and
came
to
nothing
37
After
him
Judas
the
Galilean
rose
up
in
the
days
of
the
registration
and
he
drew
followers
after
himself
That
man
also
perished
and
all
those
who
were
following
him
were
scattered
38
So
under
the
present
circumstances
I
say
to
you
do
not
meddle
with
these
men
but
let
them
alone
For
if
this
scheme
or
this
work
is
from
men
it
will
be
overthrown
39
but
if
it
is
from
God
you
will
not
be
able
to
overthrow
them
Otherwise
you
may
even
be
found
fighters
against
God
himself
40
At
this
they
took
his
advice
and
they
summoned
the
apostles
flogged
them
and
ordered
them
to
stop
speaking
on
the
basis
of
Jesus
name
and
let
them
go
41
So
they
went
out
from
before
the
Sanhedrin
rejoicing
because
they
had
been
counted
worthy
to
be
dishonored
in
behalf
of
his
name
42
And
every
day
in
the
temple
and
from
house
to
house
they
continued
without
letup
teaching
and
declaring
the
good
news
about
the
Christ
Jesus
1
Now
in
those
days
when
the
disciples
were
increasing
the
Greek-speaking
Jews
began
complaining
against
the
Hebrew-speaking
Jews
because
their
widows
were
being
overlooked
in
the
daily
distribution
2
So
the
Twelve
called
the
multitude
of
the
disciples
together
and
said
It
is
not
right
for
us
to
leave
the
word
of
God
to
distribute
food
to
tables
3
So
brothers
select
for
yourselves
seven
reputable
men
from
among
you
full
of
spirit
and
wisdom
that
we
may
appoint
them
over
this
necessary
matter
4
but
we
will
devote
ourselves
to
prayer
and
to
the
ministry
of
the
word
5
What
they
said
was
pleasing
to
the
whole
multitude
and
they
selected
Stephen
a
man
full
of
faith
and
holy
spirit
as
well
as
Philip
Prochorus
Nicanor
Timon
Parmenas
and
Nicolaus
a
proselyte
of
Antioch
6
They
brought
them
to
the
apostles
and
after
praying
they
laid
their
hands
on
them
7
Consequently
the
word
of
God
continued
to
spread
and
the
number
of
the
disciples
kept
multiplying
very
much
in
Jerusalem
and
a
large
crowd
of
priests
began
to
be
obedient
to
the
faith
8
Now
Stephen
full
of
divine
favor
and
power
was
performing
great
wonders
and
signs
among
the
people
9
But
some
men
of
the
so-called
Synagogue
of
the
Freedmen
came
forward
along
with
some
Cyrenians
and
Alexandrians
and
some
from
Cilicia
and
Asia
to
dispute
with
Stephen
10
But
they
could
not
hold
their
own
against
the
wisdom
and
the
spirit
with
which
he
was
speaking
11
Then
they
secretly
persuaded
men
to
say
We
have
heard
him
speaking
blasphemous
things
against
Moses
and
God
12
And
they
stirred
up
the
people
the
elders
and
the
scribes
and
coming
upon
him
suddenly
they
forcibly
seized
him
and
led
him
to
the
Sanhedrin
13
And
they
brought
forward
false
witnesses
who
said
This
man
does
not
stop
speaking
things
against
this
holy
place
and
against
the
Law
14
For
instance
we
have
heard
him
say
that
this
Jesus
the
Nazarene
will
throw
down
this
place
and
change
the
customs
that
Moses
handed
down
to
us
15
And
as
all
those
sitting
in
the
Sanhedrin
stared
at
him
they
saw
that
his
face
was
like
an
angels
face
1
But
the
high
priest
said
Are
these
things
so
2
Stephen
replied
Men
brothers
and
fathers
listen
The
God
of
glory
appeared
to
our
forefather
Abraham
while
he
was
in
Mesopotamia
before
he
took
up
residence
in
Haran
3
and
he
said
to
him
Go
out
from
your
land
and
from
your
relatives
and
come
into
the
land
that
I
will
show
you
4
Then
he
went
out
of
the
land
of
the
Chaldeans
and
took
up
residence
in
Haran
And
from
there
after
his
father
died
God
caused
him
to
resettle
in
this
land
where
you
now
dwell
5
And
yet
he
did
not
give
him
any
inheritance
in
it
no
not
even
enough
to
put
his
foot
on
but
he
promised
to
give
it
to
him
as
a
possession
and
after
him
to
his
offspring
though
as
yet
he
had
no
child
6
Moreover
God
told
him
that
his
offspring
would
be
foreigners
in
a
land
not
theirs
and
that
the
people
would
enslave
them
and
afflict
them
for
400
years
7
And
that
nation
for
which
they
will
slave
I
will
judge

God
said
and
after
these
things
they
will
come
out
and
will
offer
sacred
service
to
me
in
this
place
8
He
also
gave
him
a
covenant
of
circumcision
and
he
became
the
father
of
Isaac
and
circumcised
him
on
the
eighth
day
and
Isaac
became
the
father
of
Jacob
and
Jacob
of
the
12
family
heads
9
And
the
family
heads
became
jealous
of
Joseph
and
sold
him
into
Egypt
But
God
was
with
him
10
and
he
rescued
him
out
of
all
his
tribulations
and
gave
him
favor
and
wisdom
before
Pharaoh
king
of
Egypt
And
he
appointed
him
to
govern
Egypt
and
his
whole
house
11
But
a
famine
came
on
all
of
Egypt
and
Canaan
yes
a
great
tribulation
and
our
forefathers
could
not
find
anything
to
eat
12
But
Jacob
heard
that
there
were
food
supplies
in
Egypt
and
he
sent
our
forefathers
out
the
first
time
13
During
the
second
time
Joseph
made
himself
known
to
his
brothers
and
the
family
of
Joseph
became
known
to
Pharaoh
14
So
Joseph
sent
a
message
and
called
his
father
Jacob
and
all
his
relatives
from
that
place
75
persons
in
all
15
So
Jacob
went
down
into
Egypt
and
he
died
there
and
so
did
our
forefathers
16
They
were
carried
to
Shechem
and
were
laid
in
the
tomb
that
Abraham
had
bought
for
a
sum
of
silver
money
from
the
sons
of
Hamor
in
Shechem
17
Just
as
the
time
was
approaching
to
fulfill
the
promise
that
God
had
announced
to
Abraham
the
people
grew
and
multiplied
in
Egypt
18
until
there
rose
a
different
king
over
Egypt
one
who
did
not
know
of
Joseph
19
This
one
dealt
cunningly
with
our
race
and
wrongfully
forced
the
fathers
to
abandon
their
infants
so
that
they
would
not
be
kept
alive
20
At
that
time
Moses
was
born
and
he
was
divinely
beautiful
And
he
was
nursed
for
three
months
in
his
fathers
home
21
But
when
he
was
abandoned
the
daughter
of
Pharaoh
took
him
and
brought
him
up
as
her
own
son
22
So
Moses
was
instructed
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
Egyptians
In
fact
he
was
powerful
in
his
words
and
deeds
23
Now
when
he
reached
the
age
of
40
it
came
into
his
heart
to
make
a
visit
on
his
brothers
the
sons
of
Israel
24
When
he
caught
sight
of
one
of
them
being
unjustly
treated
he
defended
him
and
avenged
the
one
being
abused
by
striking
down
the
Egyptian
25
He
thought
that
his
brothers
would
grasp
that
God
was
giving
them
salvation
by
his
hand
but
they
did
not
grasp
it
26
The
next
day
he
appeared
to
them
as
they
were
fighting
and
he
tried
to
reconcile
them
in
peace
saying
Men
you
are
brothers
Why
do
you
mistreat
each
other
27
But
the
one
who
was
mistreating
his
neighbor
pushed
him
away
saying
Who
appointed
you
ruler
and
judge
over
us
28
You
do
not
want
to
do
away
with
me
the
way
you
did
away
with
the
Egyptian
yesterday
do
you
29
On
hearing
this
Moses
fled
and
lived
as
a
foreigner
in
the
land
of
Midian
where
he
became
the
father
of
two
sons
30
After
40
years
had
passed
an
angel
appeared
to
him
in
the
wilderness
of
Mount
Sinai
in
the
flame
of
a
burning
thornbush
31
When
Moses
saw
it
he
was
amazed
at
the
sight
But
as
he
was
approaching
to
investigate
Jehovahs
voice
was
heard
32
I
am
the
God
of
your
forefathers
the
God
of
Abraham
and
of
Isaac
and
of
Jacob
Moses
started
trembling
and
did
not
dare
to
investigate
further
33
Jehovah
said
to
him
Remove
the
sandals
from
your
feet
for
the
place
where
you
are
standing
is
holy
ground
34
I
have
certainly
seen
the
oppression
of
my
people
who
are
in
Egypt
and
I
have
heard
their
groaning
and
I
have
come
down
to
rescue
them
Now
come
I
will
send
you
off
to
Egypt
35
This
same
Moses
whom
they
had
disowned
saying
Who
appointed
you
ruler
and
judge
is
the
very
one
God
sent
as
both
ruler
and
deliverer
by
means
of
the
angel
who
appeared
to
him
in
the
thornbush
36
This
man
led
them
out
performing
wonders
and
signs
in
Egypt
and
at
the
Red
Sea
and
in
the
wilderness
for
40
years
37
This
is
the
Moses
who
said
to
the
sons
of
Israel
God
will
raise
up
for
you
from
among
your
brothers
a
prophet
like
me
38
This
is
the
one
who
came
to
be
among
the
congregation
in
the
wilderness
with
the
angel
who
spoke
to
him
on
Mount
Sinai
and
with
our
forefathers
and
he
received
living
sacred
pronouncements
to
give
us
39
Our
forefathers
refused
to
obey
him
but
they
pushed
him
aside
and
in
their
hearts
they
turned
back
to
Egypt
40
saying
to
Aaron
Make
gods
for
us
to
go
ahead
of
us
For
we
do
not
know
what
has
happened
to
this
Moses
who
led
us
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
41
So
they
made
a
calf
in
those
days
and
brought
a
sacrifice
to
the
idol
and
began
to
enjoy
themselves
in
the
works
of
their
hands
42
So
God
turned
away
from
them
and
handed
them
over
to
offer
sacred
service
to
the
army
of
heaven
just
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
Prophets
It
was
not
to
me
that
you
made
offerings
and
sacrifices
for
40
years
in
the
wilderness
was
it
O
house
of
Israel
43
But
it
was
the
tent
of
Moloch
and
the
star
of
the
god
Rephan
that
you
took
up
the
images
that
you
made
to
worship
them
So
I
will
deport
you
beyond
Babylon
44
Our
forefathers
had
the
tent
of
the
witness
in
the
wilderness
just
as
He
gave
orders
when
speaking
to
Moses
to
make
it
according
to
the
pattern
he
had
seen
45
And
our
forefathers
received
possession
of
it
and
brought
it
in
with
Joshua
into
the
land
possessed
by
the
nations
whom
God
drove
out
from
before
our
forefathers
Here
it
remained
until
the
days
of
David
46
He
found
favor
in
the
sight
of
God
and
asked
for
the
privilege
of
providing
a
dwelling
place
for
the
God
of
Jacob
47
But
it
was
Solomon
who
built
a
house
for
him
48
However
the
Most
High
does
not
dwell
in
houses
made
with
hands
just
as
the
prophet
says
49
The
heaven
is
my
throne
and
the
earth
is
my
footstool
What
sort
of
house
will
you
build
for
me
Jehovah
says
Or
where
is
my
resting-place
50
My
hand
made
all
these
things
did
it
not
51
Obstinate
men
and
uncircumcised
in
hearts
and
ears
you
are
always
resisting
the
holy
spirit
as
your
forefathers
did
so
you
do
52
Which
one
of
the
prophets
did
your
forefathers
not
persecute
Yes
they
killed
those
who
announced
in
advance
the
coming
of
the
righteous
one
whose
betrayers
and
murderers
you
have
now
become
53
you
who
received
the
Law
as
transmitted
by
angels
but
have
not
kept
it
54
Well
at
hearing
these
things
they
were
infuriated
in
their
hearts
and
began
to
grind
their
teeth
at
him
55
But
he
being
full
of
holy
spirit
gazed
into
heaven
and
caught
sight
of
Gods
glory
and
of
Jesus
standing
at
Gods
right
hand
56
and
he
said
Look
I
see
the
heavens
opened
up
and
the
Son
of
man
standing
at
Gods
right
hand
57
At
this
they
cried
out
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
put
their
hands
over
their
ears
and
rushed
at
him
all
together
58
After
throwing
him
outside
the
city
they
began
stoning
him
The
witnesses
laid
down
their
outer
garments
at
the
feet
of
a
young
man
called
Saul
59
As
they
were
stoning
Stephen
he
made
this
appeal
Lord
Jesus
receive
my
spirit
60
Then
kneeling
down
he
cried
out
with
a
strong
voice
Jehovah
do
not
charge
this
sin
against
them
And
after
saying
this
he
fell
asleep
in
death
1
Saul
for
his
part
approved
of
his
murder
On
that
day
great
persecution
arose
against
the
congregation
that
was
in
Jerusalem
all
except
the
apostles
were
scattered
throughout
the
regions
of
Judea
and
Samaria
2
But
devout
men
carried
Stephen
away
to
bury
him
and
they
made
a
great
mourning
over
him
3
Saul
though
began
to
ravage
the
congregation
He
would
invade
one
house
after
another
dragging
out
both
men
and
women
and
turning
them
over
to
prison
4
However
those
who
had
been
scattered
went
through
the
land
declaring
the
good
news
of
the
word
5
Now
Philip
went
down
to
the
city
of
Samaria
and
began
to
preach
the
Christ
to
them
6
The
crowds
with
one
accord
were
paying
attention
to
what
Philip
said
while
they
listened
and
observed
the
signs
he
was
performing
7
For
many
had
unclean
spirits
and
these
would
cry
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
come
out
Moreover
many
who
were
paralyzed
and
lame
were
cured
8
So
there
came
to
be
a
great
deal
of
joy
in
that
city
9
Now
in
the
city
was
a
man
named
Simon
who
prior
to
this
had
been
practicing
magical
arts
and
amazing
the
nation
of
Samaria
claiming
that
he
was
somebody
great
10
All
of
them
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
would
pay
attention
to
him
and
say
This
man
is
the
Power
of
God
which
is
called
Great
11
So
they
would
pay
attention
to
him
because
he
had
amazed
them
for
quite
a
while
by
his
magical
arts
12
But
when
they
believed
Philip
who
was
declaring
the
good
news
of
the
Kingdom
of
God
and
of
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
both
men
and
women
were
getting
baptized
13
Simon
himself
also
became
a
believer
and
after
being
baptized
he
continued
with
Philip
and
he
was
amazed
at
seeing
the
signs
and
great
powerful
works
taking
place
14
When
the
apostles
in
Jerusalem
heard
that
Samaria
had
accepted
the
word
of
God
they
sent
Peter
and
John
to
them
15
and
these
went
down
and
prayed
for
them
to
get
holy
spirit
16
For
it
had
not
yet
come
upon
any
one
of
them
but
they
had
only
been
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus
17
Then
they
laid
their
hands
on
them
and
they
began
to
receive
holy
spirit
18
Now
when
Simon
saw
that
the
spirit
was
given
through
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
of
the
apostles
he
offered
them
money
19
saying
Give
me
this
authority
also
so
that
anyone
on
whom
I
lay
my
hands
may
receive
holy
spirit
20
But
Peter
said
to
him
May
your
silver
perish
with
you
because
you
thought
you
could
acquire
the
free
gift
of
God
with
money
21
You
have
neither
part
nor
share
in
this
matter
for
your
heart
is
not
straight
in
the
sight
of
God
22
So
repent
of
this
badness
of
yours
and
supplicate
Jehovah
that
if
possible
the
wicked
intention
of
your
heart
may
be
forgiven
you
23
for
I
see
you
are
a
bitter
poison
and
a
slave
of
unrighteousness
24
In
answer
Simon
said
to
them
Make
supplication
for
me
to
Jehovah
that
none
of
the
things
you
have
said
may
come
upon
me
25
Therefore
when
they
had
given
the
witness
thoroughly
and
had
spoken
the
word
of
Jehovah
they
started
back
toward
Jerusalem
and
they
went
declaring
the
good
news
to
many
villages
of
the
Samaritans
26
However
Jehovahs
angel
spoke
to
Philip
saying
Get
up
and
go
to
the
south
to
the
road
that
runs
down
from
Jerusalem
to
Gaza
This
is
a
desert
road
27
With
that
he
got
up
and
went
and
look
an
Ethiopian
eunuch
a
man
who
had
authority
under
Candace
queen
of
the
Ethiopians
and
who
was
in
charge
of
all
her
treasure
He
had
gone
to
Jerusalem
to
worship
28
and
he
was
returning
and
was
sitting
in
his
chariot
reading
aloud
the
prophet
Isaiah
29
So
the
spirit
said
to
Philip
Go
over
and
approach
this
chariot
30
Philip
ran
alongside
and
heard
him
reading
aloud
Isaiah
the
prophet
and
he
said
Do
you
actually
know
what
you
are
reading
31
He
said
Really
how
could
I
ever
do
so
unless
someone
guided
me
So
he
urged
Philip
to
get
on
and
sit
down
with
him
32
Now
this
was
the
passage
of
Scripture
that
he
was
reading
Like
a
sheep
he
was
brought
to
the
slaughter
and
like
a
lamb
that
is
silent
before
its
shearer
so
he
does
not
open
his
mouth
33
During
his
humiliation
justice
was
taken
away
from
him
Who
will
tell
the
details
of
his
generation
Because
his
life
is
taken
away
from
the
earth
34
The
eunuch
then
said
to
Philip
I
beg
you
about
whom
does
the
prophet
say
this
About
himself
or
about
some
other
man
35
Philip
began
to
speak
and
starting
with
this
scripture
he
declared
to
him
the
good
news
about
Jesus
36
Now
as
they
were
going
along
the
road
they
came
to
a
body
of
water
and
the
eunuch
said
Look
Here
is
water
what
prevents
me
from
getting
baptized
37
——
38
With
that
he
commanded
the
chariot
to
halt
and
both
Philip
and
the
eunuch
went
down
into
the
water
and
he
baptized
him
39
When
they
came
up
out
of
the
water
Jehovahs
spirit
quickly
led
Philip
away
and
the
eunuch
did
not
see
him
anymore
but
he
went
on
his
way
rejoicing
40
Philip
however
found
himself
in
Ashdod
and
he
went
through
the
territory
and
kept
on
declaring
the
good
news
to
all
the
cities
until
he
got
to
Caesarea
1
But
Saul
still
breathing
threat
and
murder
against
the
disciples
of
the
Lord
went
to
the
high
priest
2
and
asked
him
for
letters
to
the
synagogues
in
Damascus
so
that
he
might
bring
bound
to
Jerusalem
any
whom
he
found
who
belonged
to
The
Way
both
men
and
women
3
Now
as
he
was
traveling
and
getting
near
Damascus
suddenly
a
light
from
heaven
flashed
around
him
4
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
heard
a
voice
say
to
him
Saul
Saul
why
are
you
persecuting
me
5
He
asked
Who
are
you
Lord
He
said
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are
persecuting
6
But
get
up
and
go
into
the
city
and
you
will
be
told
what
you
must
do
7
Now
the
men
who
were
traveling
with
him
stood
speechless
hearing
indeed
the
sound
of
a
voice
but
seeing
no
one
8
Saul
then
got
up
from
the
ground
and
though
his
eyes
were
open
he
could
see
nothing
So
they
led
him
by
the
hand
and
brought
him
into
Damascus
9
And
for
three
days
he
did
not
see
anything
and
he
neither
ate
nor
drank
10
There
was
a
disciple
named
Ananias
in
Damascus
and
the
Lord
said
to
him
in
a
vision
Ananias
He
said
Here
I
am
Lord
11
The
Lord
said
to
him
Get
up
go
to
the
street
called
Straight
and
look
for
a
man
named
Saul
from
Tarsus
at
the
house
of
Judas
For
look
he
is
praying
12
and
in
a
vision
he
has
seen
a
man
named
Ananias
come
in
and
lay
his
hands
on
him
so
that
he
may
recover
sight
13
But
Ananias
answered
Lord
I
have
heard
from
many
about
this
man
about
all
the
harm
he
did
to
your
holy
ones
in
Jerusalem
14
And
here
he
has
authority
from
the
chief
priests
to
arrest
all
those
calling
on
your
name
15
But
the
Lord
said
to
him
Go
because
this
man
is
a
chosen
vessel
to
me
to
bear
my
name
to
the
nations
as
well
as
to
kings
and
the
sons
of
Israel
16
For
I
will
show
him
plainly
how
many
things
he
must
suffer
for
my
name
17
So
Ananias
went
and
entered
the
house
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
him
and
said
Saul
brother
the
Lord
Jesus
who
appeared
to
you
on
the
road
along
which
you
were
coming
has
sent
me
so
that
you
may
recover
sight
and
be
filled
with
holy
spirit
18
And
immediately
what
looked
like
scales
fell
from
his
eyes
and
he
recovered
his
sight
He
then
got
up
and
was
baptized
19
and
he
ate
some
food
and
gained
strength
He
stayed
for
some
days
with
the
disciples
in
Damascus
20
and
immediately
in
the
synagogues
he
began
to
preach
about
Jesus
that
this
one
is
the
Son
of
God
21
But
all
those
hearing
him
were
astonished
and
were
saying
Is
this
not
the
man
who
ravaged
those
in
Jerusalem
who
call
on
this
name
Did
he
not
come
here
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
them
and
taking
them
to
the
chief
priests
22
But
Saul
kept
on
acquiring
more
and
more
power
and
was
confounding
the
Jews
who
lived
in
Damascus
as
he
proved
logically
that
this
is
the
Christ
23
Now
when
many
days
had
passed
the
Jews
plotted
together
to
do
away
with
him
24
However
their
plot
against
Saul
became
known
to
him
They
were
also
watching
the
gates
closely
both
day
and
night
in
order
to
do
away
with
him
25
So
his
disciples
took
him
and
let
him
down
by
night
through
an
opening
in
the
wall
lowering
him
in
a
basket
26
On
arriving
in
Jerusalem
he
made
efforts
to
join
the
disciples
but
they
were
all
afraid
of
him
because
they
did
not
believe
he
was
a
disciple
27
So
Barnabas
came
to
his
aid
and
led
him
to
the
apostles
and
he
told
them
in
detail
how
on
the
road
he
had
seen
the
Lord
and
that
he
had
spoken
to
him
and
how
in
Damascus
he
had
spoken
boldly
in
the
name
of
Jesus
28
So
he
remained
with
them
moving
about
freely
in
Jerusalem
speaking
boldly
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
29
He
was
talking
and
disputing
with
the
Greek-speaking
Jews
but
these
made
attempts
to
do
away
with
him
30
When
the
brothers
found
out
about
this
they
brought
him
down
to
Caesarea
and
sent
him
off
to
Tarsus
31
Then
indeed
the
congregation
throughout
the
whole
of
Judea
and
Galilee
and
Samaria
entered
into
a
period
of
peace
being
built
up
and
as
it
walked
in
the
fear
of
Jehovah
and
in
the
comfort
of
the
holy
spirit
it
kept
on
multiplying
32
Now
as
Peter
was
traveling
through
all
the
region
he
came
down
also
to
the
holy
ones
who
lived
in
Lydda
33
There
he
found
a
man
named
Aeneas
who
had
been
lying
flat
on
his
bed
for
eight
years
for
he
was
paralyzed
34
Peter
said
to
him
Aeneas
Jesus
Christ
heals
you
Rise
and
make
up
your
bed
And
he
got
up
immediately
35
When
all
those
living
in
Lydda
and
the
Plain
of
Sharon
saw
him
they
turned
to
the
Lord
36
Now
there
was
in
Joppa
a
disciple
named
Tabitha
which
means
when
translated
Dorcas
She
abounded
in
good
deeds
and
gifts
of
mercy
that
she
was
making
37
But
in
those
days
she
fell
sick
and
died
So
they
bathed
her
and
laid
her
in
an
upper
room
38
Since
Lydda
was
near
Joppa
when
the
disciples
heard
that
Peter
was
in
that
city
they
sent
two
men
to
him
to
urge
him
Please
come
to
us
without
delay
39
At
that
Peter
got
up
and
went
with
them
And
when
he
arrived
they
led
him
up
into
the
upper
room
and
all
the
widows
presented
themselves
to
him
weeping
and
showing
many
garments
and
robes
that
Dorcas
had
made
while
she
was
with
them
40
Peter
then
put
everyone
outside
and
kneeling
down
he
prayed
Then
turning
toward
the
body
he
said
Tabitha
rise
She
opened
her
eyes
and
as
she
caught
sight
of
Peter
she
sat
up
41
Giving
her
his
hand
he
raised
her
up
and
he
called
the
holy
ones
and
the
widows
and
presented
her
alive
42
This
became
known
throughout
all
Joppa
and
many
became
believers
in
the
Lord
43
He
remained
for
quite
a
few
days
in
Joppa
with
a
tanner
named
Simon
1
Now
there
was
a
man
in
Caesarea
named
Cornelius
an
army
officer
in
what
was
called
the
Italian
unit
2
He
was
a
devout
man
who
feared
God
together
with
all
his
household
and
he
made
many
gifts
of
mercy
to
the
people
and
made
supplication
to
God
continually
3
About
the
ninth
hour
of
the
day
he
saw
plainly
in
a
vision
an
angel
of
God
come
in
to
him
and
say
Cornelius
4
Cornelius
stared
at
him
terrified
and
asked
What
is
it
Lord
He
said
to
him
Your
prayers
and
gifts
of
mercy
have
ascended
as
a
remembrance
before
God
5
So
now
send
men
to
Joppa
and
summon
a
man
named
Simon
who
is
called
Peter
6
This
man
is
staying
as
a
guest
with
Simon
a
tanner
who
has
a
house
by
the
sea
7
As
soon
as
the
angel
who
spoke
to
him
left
he
called
two
of
his
servants
and
a
devout
soldier
from
among
those
who
were
his
attendants
8
and
he
related
everything
to
them
and
sent
them
to
Joppa
9
The
next
day
as
they
were
continuing
on
their
journey
and
were
approaching
the
city
Peter
went
up
to
the
housetop
about
the
sixth
hour
to
pray
10
But
he
became
very
hungry
and
wanted
to
eat
While
they
were
preparing
the
meal
he
fell
into
a
trance
11
and
saw
heaven
opened
and
something
descending
like
a
great
linen
sheet
being
let
down
by
its
four
corners
on
the
earth
12
and
in
it
were
all
sorts
of
four-footed
animals
and
reptiles
of
the
earth
and
birds
of
heaven
13
Then
a
voice
said
to
him
Get
up
Peter
slaughter
and
eat
14
But
Peter
said
Not
at
all
Lord
because
I
have
never
eaten
anything
defiled
and
unclean
15
And
the
voice
spoke
again
to
him
the
second
time
Stop
calling
defiled
the
things
God
has
cleansed
16
This
happened
a
third
time
and
immediately
it
was
taken
up
into
heaven
17
While
Peter
was
still
perplexed
about
what
the
vision
he
had
seen
could
mean
just
then
the
men
sent
by
Cornelius
asked
where
Simons
house
was
and
stood
there
at
the
gate
18
They
called
out
and
inquired
whether
Simon
who
was
called
Peter
was
a
guest
there
19
As
Peter
was
still
pondering
over
the
vision
the
spirit
said
Look
Three
men
are
asking
for
you
20
So
get
up
go
downstairs
and
go
with
them
not
doubting
at
all
because
I
have
sent
them
21
Then
Peter
went
downstairs
to
the
men
and
said
Here
I
am
the
one
you
are
looking
for
Why
are
you
here
22
They
said
Cornelius
an
army
officer
a
righteous
and
God-fearing
man
who
is
well-reported-on
by
the
whole
nation
of
the
Jews
was
given
divine
instructions
by
a
holy
angel
to
send
for
you
to
come
to
his
house
and
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
23
So
he
invited
them
in
and
had
them
stay
as
his
guests
The
next
day
he
got
up
and
went
off
with
them
and
some
of
the
brothers
from
Joppa
went
with
him
24
The
following
day
he
entered
into
Caesarea
Cornelius
of
course
was
expecting
them
and
had
called
together
his
relatives
and
close
friends
25
As
Peter
entered
Cornelius
met
him
fell
down
at
his
feet
and
did
obeisance
to
him
26
But
Peter
lifted
him
up
saying
Rise
I
too
am
just
a
man
27
As
he
conversed
with
him
he
went
in
and
found
many
people
assembled
28
He
said
to
them
You
well
know
how
unlawful
it
is
for
a
Jew
to
associate
with
or
approach
a
man
of
another
race
and
yet
God
has
shown
me
that
I
should
call
no
man
defiled
or
unclean
29
So
I
came
really
without
objection
when
I
was
sent
for
Therefore
I
ask
you
why
you
sent
for
me
30
Then
Cornelius
said
Four
days
ago
counting
from
this
hour
I
was
praying
in
my
house
at
the
ninth
hour
just
then
a
man
in
bright
clothing
stood
in
front
of
me
31
and
said
Cornelius
your
prayer
has
been
favorably
heard
and
your
gifts
of
mercy
have
been
remembered
before
God
32
Therefore
send
to
Joppa
and
call
for
Simon
who
is
called
Peter
This
man
is
a
guest
in
the
house
of
Simon
a
tanner
by
the
sea
33
I
then
sent
for
you
at
once
and
you
were
kind
enough
to
come
here
So
now
we
are
all
present
before
God
to
hear
all
the
things
you
have
been
commanded
by
Jehovah
to
say
34
At
this
Peter
began
to
speak
and
he
said
Now
I
truly
understand
that
God
is
not
partial
35
but
in
every
nation
the
man
who
fears
him
and
does
what
is
right
is
acceptable
to
him
36
He
sent
out
the
word
to
the
sons
of
Israel
to
declare
to
them
the
good
news
of
peace
through
Jesus
Christ—this
one
is
Lord
of
all
37
You
know
the
subject
that
was
talked
about
throughout
all
Judea
starting
from
Galilee
after
the
baptism
that
John
preached
38
about
Jesus
who
was
from
Nazareth
how
God
anointed
him
with
holy
spirit
and
power
and
he
went
through
the
land
doing
good
and
healing
all
those
oppressed
by
the
Devil
because
God
was
with
him
39
And
we
are
witnesses
of
all
the
things
he
did
both
in
the
country
of
the
Jews
and
in
Jerusalem
but
they
did
away
with
him
by
hanging
him
on
a
stake
40
God
raised
this
one
up
on
the
third
day
and
allowed
him
to
become
manifest
41
not
to
all
the
people
but
to
witnesses
appointed
beforehand
by
God
to
us
who
ate
and
drank
with
him
after
his
rising
from
the
dead
42
Also
he
ordered
us
to
preach
to
the
people
and
to
give
a
thorough
witness
that
this
is
the
one
decreed
by
God
to
be
judge
of
the
living
and
the
dead
43
To
him
all
the
prophets
bear
witness
that
everyone
putting
faith
in
him
receives
forgiveness
of
sins
through
his
name
44
While
Peter
was
still
speaking
about
these
matters
the
holy
spirit
came
upon
all
those
hearing
the
word
45
And
the
circumcised
believers
who
had
come
with
Peter
were
amazed
because
the
free
gift
of
the
holy
spirit
was
being
poured
out
also
on
people
of
the
nations
46
For
they
heard
them
speaking
in
foreign
languages
and
magnifying
God
Then
Peter
responded
47
Can
anyone
deny
water
to
prevent
these
from
being
baptized
who
have
received
the
holy
spirit
just
as
we
have
48
With
that
he
commanded
them
to
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
Then
they
requested
him
to
stay
for
some
days
1
Now
the
apostles
and
the
brothers
who
were
in
Judea
heard
that
people
of
the
nations
had
also
accepted
the
word
of
God
2
So
when
Peter
came
up
to
Jerusalem
the
supporters
of
circumcision
began
to
criticize
him
3
saying
You
went
into
the
house
of
men
who
were
not
circumcised
and
ate
with
them
4
At
this
Peter
went
on
to
explain
the
matter
in
detail
to
them
saying
5
I
was
in
the
city
of
Joppa
praying
and
while
in
a
trance
I
saw
a
vision
something
descending
like
a
great
linen
sheet
being
let
down
by
its
four
corners
from
heaven
and
it
came
right
down
to
me
6
Looking
closely
into
it
I
observed
four-footed
animals
of
the
earth
wild
beasts
reptiles
and
birds
of
heaven
7
I
also
heard
a
voice
say
to
me
Get
up
Peter
slaughter
and
eat
8
But
I
said
Certainly
not
Lord
because
a
defiled
or
unclean
thing
has
never
entered
my
mouth
9
The
second
time
the
voice
from
heaven
answered
You
stop
calling
defiled
the
things
God
has
cleansed
10
This
happened
a
third
time
and
everything
was
pulled
up
again
into
heaven
11
Also
just
at
that
moment
three
men
were
standing
at
the
house
where
we
were
staying
having
been
sent
to
me
from
Caesarea
12
Then
the
spirit
told
me
to
go
with
them
not
doubting
at
all
But
these
six
brothers
also
went
with
me
and
we
entered
into
the
house
of
the
man
13
He
reported
to
us
how
he
saw
the
angel
stand
in
his
house
and
say
Send
men
to
Joppa
and
summon
Simon
who
is
called
Peter
14
and
he
will
tell
you
things
by
which
you
and
all
your
household
may
get
saved
15
But
when
I
started
to
speak
the
holy
spirit
fell
on
them
just
as
it
did
also
on
us
in
the
beginning
16
At
this
I
recalled
the
saying
of
the
Lord
how
he
used
to
say
John
baptized
with
water
but
you
will
be
baptized
with
holy
spirit
17
If
therefore
God
gave
the
same
free
gift
to
them
that
he
gave
to
us
who
have
believed
in
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
who
was
I
that
I
should
be
able
to
hinder
God
18
When
they
heard
these
things
they
stopped
objecting
and
they
glorified
God
saying
So
then
God
has
also
granted
to
people
of
the
nations
repentance
leading
to
life
19
Now
those
who
had
been
scattered
by
the
tribulation
that
arose
over
Stephen
went
as
far
as
Phoenicia
Cyprus
and
Antioch
but
they
spoke
the
word
only
to
the
Jews
20
However
some
of
the
men
among
them
from
Cyprus
and
Cyrene
came
to
Antioch
and
began
talking
to
the
Greek-speaking
people
declaring
the
good
news
of
the
Lord
Jesus
21
Furthermore
the
hand
of
Jehovah
was
with
them
and
a
great
number
became
believers
and
turned
to
the
Lord
22
The
report
about
them
reached
the
ears
of
the
congregation
in
Jerusalem
and
they
sent
out
Barnabas
as
far
as
Antioch
23
When
he
arrived
and
saw
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
he
rejoiced
and
began
to
encourage
them
all
to
continue
in
the
Lord
with
heartfelt
resolve
24
for
he
was
a
good
man
and
full
of
holy
spirit
and
faith
And
a
considerable
crowd
was
added
to
the
Lord
25
So
he
went
to
Tarsus
to
make
a
thorough
search
for
Saul
26
After
he
found
him
he
brought
him
to
Antioch
So
for
a
whole
year
they
assembled
with
them
in
the
congregation
and
taught
quite
a
crowd
and
it
was
first
in
Antioch
that
the
disciples
were
by
divine
providence
called
Christians
27
In
those
days
prophets
came
down
from
Jerusalem
to
Antioch
28
One
of
them
named
Agabus
stood
up
and
foretold
through
the
spirit
that
a
great
famine
was
about
to
come
on
the
entire
inhabited
earth
which
in
fact
did
take
place
in
the
time
of
Claudius
29
So
the
disciples
determined
each
according
to
what
he
could
afford
to
send
relief
to
the
brothers
living
in
Judea
30
and
this
they
did
sending
it
to
the
elders
by
the
hand
of
Barnabas
and
Saul
1
About
that
time
Herod
the
king
began
mistreating
some
of
those
of
the
congregation
2
He
put
James
the
brother
of
John
to
death
by
the
sword
3
When
he
saw
that
it
was
pleasing
to
the
Jews
he
also
went
on
to
arrest
Peter
This
was
during
the
days
of
the
Unleavened
Bread
4
He
seized
him
and
put
him
in
prison
turning
him
over
to
four
shifts
of
four
soldiers
each
to
guard
him
intending
to
bring
him
out
before
the
people
after
the
Passover
5
So
Peter
was
being
kept
in
the
prison
but
the
congregation
was
intensely
praying
to
God
for
him
6
When
Herod
was
about
to
bring
him
out
that
night
Peter
was
sleeping
bound
with
two
chains
between
two
soldiers
and
guards
in
front
of
the
door
were
keeping
watch
over
the
prison
7
But
look
Jehovahs
angel
was
standing
there
and
a
light
shone
in
the
prison
cell
Hitting
Peter
on
the
side
he
woke
him
saying
Get
up
quickly
And
the
chains
fell
off
his
hands
8
The
angel
said
to
him
Get
dressed
and
put
on
your
sandals
He
did
so
Finally
he
said
to
him
Put
your
outer
garment
on
and
keep
following
me
9
And
he
went
out
and
kept
following
him
but
he
did
not
know
that
what
was
happening
through
the
angel
was
real
In
fact
he
thought
he
was
seeing
a
vision
10
Going
past
the
first
sentinel
guard
and
the
second
they
reached
the
iron
gate
leading
into
the
city
and
this
opened
to
them
by
itself
After
they
went
out
they
made
their
way
down
one
street
and
immediately
the
angel
departed
from
him
11
And
Peter
realizing
what
was
happening
said
Now
I
know
for
sure
that
Jehovah
sent
his
angel
and
rescued
me
from
Herods
hand
and
from
everything
that
the
Jews
were
expecting
to
happen
12
After
he
realized
this
he
went
to
the
house
of
Mary
the
mother
of
John
who
was
called
Mark
where
quite
a
few
were
gathered
together
and
were
praying
13
When
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
gateway
a
servant
girl
named
Rhoda
came
to
answer
the
call
14
On
recognizing
the
voice
of
Peter
she
was
so
overjoyed
that
she
did
not
open
the
gate
but
ran
inside
and
reported
that
Peter
was
standing
at
the
gateway
15
They
said
to
her
You
are
out
of
your
mind
But
she
kept
insisting
that
it
was
so
They
began
to
say
It
is
his
angel
16
But
Peter
remained
there
knocking
When
they
opened
the
door
they
saw
him
and
were
astonished
17
But
he
motioned
to
them
with
his
hand
to
be
silent
and
told
them
in
detail
how
Jehovah
had
brought
him
out
of
the
prison
and
he
said
Report
these
things
to
James
and
the
brothers
With
that
he
went
out
and
traveled
to
another
place
18
Now
when
it
became
day
there
was
quite
a
disturbance
among
the
soldiers
over
what
had
become
of
Peter
19
Herod
made
a
diligent
search
for
him
and
not
finding
him
he
interrogated
the
guards
and
commanded
them
to
be
led
off
to
punishment
and
he
went
down
from
Judea
to
Caesarea
and
spent
some
time
there
20
Now
he
was
in
an
angry
mood
against
the
people
of
Tyre
and
Sidon
So
they
came
to
him
with
one
purpose
and
after
persuading
Blastus
the
man
in
charge
of
the
kings
household
affairs
they
sued
for
peace
because
their
country
was
supplied
with
food
from
the
land
of
the
king
21
On
a
set
day
Herod
clothed
himself
with
royal
raiment
and
sat
down
on
the
judgment
seat
and
began
giving
them
a
public
address
22
Then
the
people
who
were
assembled
began
shouting
A
gods
voice
and
not
a
mans
23
Instantly
the
angel
of
Jehovah
struck
him
because
he
did
not
give
the
glory
to
God
and
he
was
eaten
up
with
worms
and
died
24
But
the
word
of
Jehovah
went
on
growing
and
spreading
25
As
for
Barnabas
and
Saul
after
fully
carrying
out
the
relief
work
in
Jerusalem
they
returned
and
took
along
with
them
John
the
one
also
called
Mark
1
Now
in
Antioch
there
were
prophets
and
teachers
in
the
local
congregation
Barnabas
Symeon
who
was
called
Niger
Lucius
of
Cyrene
Manaen
who
was
educated
with
Herod
the
district
ruler
and
Saul
2
As
they
were
ministering
to
Jehovah
and
fasting
the
holy
spirit
said
Set
aside
for
me
Barnabas
and
Saul
for
the
work
to
which
I
have
called
them
3
Then
after
fasting
and
praying
they
laid
their
hands
on
them
and
sent
them
off
4
So
these
men
sent
out
by
the
holy
spirit
went
down
to
Seleucia
and
from
there
they
sailed
away
to
Cyprus
5
When
they
arrived
in
Salamis
they
began
proclaiming
the
word
of
God
in
the
synagogues
of
the
Jews
They
also
had
John
as
an
attendant
6
When
they
had
gone
through
the
whole
island
as
far
as
Paphos
they
met
up
with
a
Jewish
man
named
Bar-Jesus
who
was
a
sorcerer
and
a
false
prophet
7
He
was
with
the
proconsul
Sergius
Paulus
an
intelligent
man
Calling
Barnabas
and
Saul
to
him
this
man
was
eager
to
hear
the
word
of
God
8
But
Elymas
the
sorcerer
for
that
is
how
his
name
is
translated
began
opposing
them
trying
to
turn
the
proconsul
away
from
the
faith
9
Then
Saul
also
called
Paul
becoming
filled
with
holy
spirit
looked
at
him
intently
10
and
said
O
man
full
of
every
sort
of
fraud
and
every
sort
of
villainy
you
son
of
the
Devil
you
enemy
of
everything
righteous
will
you
not
quit
distorting
the
right
ways
of
Jehovah
11
Look
Jehovahs
hand
is
upon
you
and
you
will
be
blind
not
seeing
the
sunlight
for
a
time
Instantly
a
thick
mist
and
darkness
fell
on
him
and
he
went
around
trying
to
find
someone
to
lead
him
by
the
hand
12
Then
the
proconsul
on
seeing
what
had
happened
became
a
believer
for
he
was
astounded
at
the
teaching
of
Jehovah
13
Now
Paul
and
his
companions
put
out
to
sea
from
Paphos
and
arrived
at
Perga
in
Pamphylia
But
John
left
them
and
returned
to
Jerusalem
14
However
they
went
on
from
Perga
and
came
to
Antioch
in
Pisidia
And
going
into
the
synagogue
on
the
Sabbath
day
they
took
a
seat
15
After
the
public
reading
of
the
Law
and
the
Prophets
the
presiding
officers
of
the
synagogue
sent
word
to
them
saying
Men
brothers
if
you
have
any
word
of
encouragement
for
the
people
tell
it
16
So
Paul
stood
up
and
motioning
with
his
hand
he
said
Men
Israelites
and
you
others
who
fear
God
listen
17
The
God
of
this
people
Israel
chose
our
forefathers
and
he
exalted
the
people
while
they
lived
as
foreigners
in
the
land
of
Egypt
and
brought
them
out
of
it
with
an
uplifted
arm
18
And
for
a
period
of
about
40
years
he
put
up
with
them
in
the
wilderness
19
After
destroying
seven
nations
in
the
land
of
Canaan
he
assigned
their
land
as
an
inheritance
20
All
of
that
was
during
about
450
years
After
this
he
gave
them
judges
until
Samuel
the
prophet
21
But
afterward
they
demanded
a
king
and
God
gave
them
Saul
the
son
of
Kish
a
man
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
for
40
years
22
After
removing
him
he
raised
up
for
them
David
as
king
about
whom
he
bore
witness
and
said
I
have
found
David
the
son
of
Jesse
a
man
agreeable
to
my
heart
he
will
do
all
the
things
I
desire
23
According
to
his
promise
from
the
offspring
of
this
man
God
has
brought
to
Israel
a
savior
Jesus
24
Before
the
arrival
of
that
one
John
had
preached
publicly
to
all
the
people
of
Israel
baptism
in
symbol
of
repentance
25
But
as
John
was
finishing
his
course
he
would
say
What
do
you
suppose
I
am
I
am
not
he
But
look
One
is
coming
after
me
the
sandals
of
whose
feet
I
am
not
worthy
to
untie
26
Men
brothers
you
descendants
of
Abrahams
family
and
those
others
among
you
who
fear
God
the
word
of
this
salvation
has
been
sent
to
us
27
For
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
and
their
rulers
did
not
recognize
this
one
but
when
acting
as
judges
they
fulfilled
the
things
spoken
by
the
Prophets
which
are
read
aloud
every
sabbath
28
Even
though
they
found
no
cause
for
death
they
demanded
of
Pilate
to
have
him
executed
29
And
when
they
had
accomplished
all
the
things
written
about
him
they
took
him
down
from
the
stake
and
laid
him
in
a
tomb
30
But
God
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
31
and
for
many
days
he
became
visible
to
those
who
had
gone
with
him
from
Galilee
up
to
Jerusalem
These
are
now
his
witnesses
to
the
people
32
So
we
are
declaring
to
you
the
good
news
about
the
promise
made
to
the
forefathers
33
God
has
completely
fulfilled
it
to
us
their
children
by
resurrecting
Jesus
just
as
it
is
written
in
the
second
psalm
You
are
my
son
today
I
have
become
your
father
34
And
the
fact
that
He
resurrected
him
from
the
dead
never
again
to
return
to
corruption
He
has
stated
in
this
way
I
will
give
you
the
expressions
of
loyal
love
promised
to
David
which
are
faithful
35
So
it
also
says
in
another
psalm
You
will
not
allow
your
loyal
one
to
see
corruption
36
David
on
the
one
hand
rendered
service
to
God
in
his
own
generation
fell
asleep
in
death
was
laid
with
his
forefathers
and
did
see
corruption
37
On
the
other
hand
the
one
whom
God
raised
up
did
not
see
corruption
38
Let
it
therefore
be
known
to
you
brothers
that
through
this
one
a
forgiveness
of
sins
is
being
proclaimed
to
you
39
and
that
from
all
the
things
from
which
you
could
not
be
declared
guiltless
by
means
of
the
Law
of
Moses
everyone
who
believes
is
declared
guiltless
by
means
of
this
one
40
Therefore
watch
out
that
what
is
said
in
the
Prophets
does
not
come
upon
you
41
Look
at
it
you
scorners
and
be
amazed
and
perish
for
I
am
doing
a
work
in
your
days
a
work
that
you
will
never
believe
even
if
anyone
relates
it
to
you
in
detail
42
Now
when
they
were
going
out
the
people
pleaded
with
them
to
speak
about
these
matters
on
the
following
Sabbath
43
So
after
the
synagogue
assembly
was
dismissed
many
of
the
Jews
and
the
proselytes
who
worshipped
God
followed
Paul
and
Barnabas
who
as
they
spoke
to
them
urged
them
to
remain
in
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
44
The
next
Sabbath
nearly
all
the
city
gathered
together
to
hear
the
word
of
Jehovah
45
When
the
Jews
saw
the
crowds
they
were
filled
with
jealousy
and
began
blasphemously
contradicting
the
things
Paul
was
saying
46
Then
Paul
and
Barnabas
boldly
said
to
them
It
was
necessary
for
the
word
of
God
to
be
spoken
first
to
you
Since
you
are
rejecting
it
and
do
not
judge
yourselves
worthy
of
everlasting
life
look
we
turn
to
the
nations
47
For
Jehovah
has
commanded
us
in
these
words
I
have
appointed
you
as
a
light
of
nations
for
you
to
be
a
salvation
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
48
When
those
of
the
nations
heard
this
they
began
to
rejoice
and
to
glorify
the
word
of
Jehovah
and
all
those
who
were
rightly
disposed
for
everlasting
life
became
believers
49
Furthermore
the
word
of
Jehovah
was
being
spread
throughout
the
whole
country
50
But
the
Jews
incited
the
prominent
women
who
were
God-fearing
and
the
principal
men
of
the
city
and
they
stirred
up
persecution
against
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
threw
them
outside
their
boundaries
51
So
they
shook
the
dust
off
their
feet
against
them
and
went
to
Iconium
52
And
the
disciples
continued
to
be
filled
with
joy
and
holy
spirit
1
Now
in
Iconium
they
entered
together
into
the
synagogue
of
the
Jews
and
spoke
in
such
a
manner
that
a
great
multitude
of
both
Jews
and
Greeks
became
believers
2
But
the
Jews
who
did
not
believe
stirred
up
and
wrongly
influenced
the
people
of
the
nations
against
the
brothers
3
So
they
spent
considerable
time
speaking
with
boldness
by
the
authority
of
Jehovah
who
bore
witness
to
the
word
of
his
undeserved
kindness
by
allowing
signs
and
wonders
to
be
performed
through
them
4
However
the
multitude
of
the
city
was
divided
some
were
for
the
Jews
but
others
for
the
apostles
5
When
both
the
people
of
the
nations
and
the
Jews
with
their
rulers
made
an
attempt
to
treat
them
insolently
and
stone
them
6
they
were
informed
of
it
and
they
fled
to
the
cities
of
Lycaonia
Lystra
and
Derbe
and
to
the
surrounding
country
7
There
they
went
on
declaring
the
good
news
8
Now
in
Lystra
there
was
a
man
sitting
down
whose
feet
were
crippled
He
was
lame
from
birth
and
had
never
walked
9
This
man
was
listening
to
Paul
as
he
was
speaking
Paul
looking
intently
at
him
and
seeing
that
he
had
faith
to
be
made
well
10
said
with
a
loud
voice
Stand
up
on
your
feet
So
the
man
leaped
up
and
began
walking
11
When
the
crowds
saw
what
Paul
had
done
they
cried
out
in
the
Lycaonian
language
The
gods
have
become
like
humans
and
have
come
down
to
us
12
And
they
started
calling
Barnabas
Zeus
but
Paul
Hermes
since
he
was
taking
the
lead
in
speaking
13
And
the
priest
of
Zeus
whose
temple
was
at
the
entrance
of
the
city
brought
bulls
and
garlands
to
the
gates
and
wanted
to
offer
sacrifices
with
the
crowds
14
However
when
the
apostles
Barnabas
and
Paul
heard
of
it
they
ripped
their
garments
and
leaped
out
into
the
crowd
and
cried
out
15
Men
why
are
you
doing
these
things
We
too
are
humans
having
the
same
infirmities
as
you
have
And
we
are
declaring
the
good
news
to
you
for
you
to
turn
from
these
vain
things
to
the
living
God
who
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
the
things
in
them
16
In
past
generations
he
permitted
all
the
nations
to
go
on
in
their
ways
17
although
he
did
not
leave
himself
without
witness
in
that
he
did
good
giving
you
rains
from
heaven
and
fruitful
seasons
satisfying
you
with
food
and
filling
your
hearts
with
gladness
18
And
yet
despite
saying
these
things
they
barely
restrained
the
crowds
from
sacrificing
to
them
19
But
Jews
arrived
from
Antioch
and
Iconium
and
persuaded
the
crowds
and
they
stoned
Paul
and
dragged
him
outside
the
city
imagining
that
he
was
dead
20
However
when
the
disciples
surrounded
him
he
got
up
and
entered
the
city
On
the
next
day
he
left
with
Barnabas
for
Derbe
21
After
declaring
the
good
news
to
that
city
and
making
quite
a
few
disciples
they
returned
to
Lystra
Iconium
and
Antioch
22
There
they
strengthened
the
disciples
encouraging
them
to
remain
in
the
faith
and
saying
We
must
enter
into
the
Kingdom
of
God
through
many
tribulations
23
Moreover
they
appointed
elders
for
them
in
each
congregation
offering
prayer
with
fasting
and
they
entrusted
them
to
Jehovah
in
whom
they
had
become
believers
24
Then
they
went
through
Pisidia
and
came
into
Pamphylia
25
and
after
proclaiming
the
word
in
Perga
they
went
down
to
Attalia
26
From
there
they
sailed
off
for
Antioch
where
they
had
been
entrusted
to
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
for
the
work
they
had
now
completed
27
When
they
had
arrived
and
had
gathered
the
congregation
together
they
related
the
many
things
God
had
done
by
means
of
them
and
that
he
had
opened
to
the
nations
the
door
to
faith
28
So
they
spent
considerable
time
with
the
disciples
1
Now
some
men
came
down
from
Judea
and
began
to
teach
the
brothers
Unless
you
get
circumcised
according
to
the
custom
of
Moses
you
cannot
be
saved
2
But
after
quite
a
bit
of
dissension
and
disputing
by
Paul
and
Barnabas
with
them
it
was
arranged
for
Paul
Barnabas
and
some
of
the
others
to
go
up
to
the
apostles
and
elders
in
Jerusalem
regarding
this
issue
3
So
after
being
escorted
partway
by
the
congregation
these
men
continued
on
through
both
Phoenicia
and
Samaria
relating
in
detail
the
conversion
of
people
of
the
nations
and
bringing
great
joy
to
all
the
brothers
4
On
arriving
in
Jerusalem
they
were
kindly
received
by
the
congregation
and
the
apostles
and
the
elders
and
they
related
the
many
things
God
had
done
by
means
of
them
5
But
some
of
those
of
the
sect
of
the
Pharisees
who
had
become
believers
stood
up
from
their
seats
and
said
It
is
necessary
to
circumcise
them
and
command
them
to
observe
the
Law
of
Moses
6
So
the
apostles
and
the
elders
gathered
together
to
look
into
this
matter
7
After
much
intense
discussion
had
taken
place
Peter
rose
and
said
to
them
Men
brothers
you
well
know
that
from
early
days
God
made
the
choice
among
you
that
through
my
mouth
people
of
the
nations
should
hear
the
word
of
the
good
news
and
believe
8
And
God
who
knows
the
heart
bore
witness
by
giving
them
the
holy
spirit
just
as
he
did
to
us
also
9
And
he
made
no
distinction
at
all
between
us
and
them
but
purified
their
hearts
by
faith
10
So
why
are
you
now
making
a
test
of
God
by
imposing
on
the
neck
of
the
disciples
a
yoke
that
neither
our
forefathers
nor
we
were
capable
of
bearing
11
On
the
contrary
we
have
faith
that
we
are
saved
through
the
undeserved
kindness
of
the
Lord
Jesus
in
the
same
way
that
they
are
12
At
that
the
entire
group
became
silent
and
they
began
to
listen
to
Barnabas
and
Paul
relate
the
many
signs
and
wonders
that
God
had
done
through
them
among
the
nations
13
After
they
finished
speaking
James
replied
Men
brothers
hear
me
14
Symeon
has
related
thoroughly
how
God
for
the
first
time
turned
his
attention
to
the
nations
to
take
out
of
them
a
people
for
his
name
15
And
with
this
the
words
of
the
Prophets
agree
just
as
it
is
written
16
After
these
things
I
will
return
and
raise
up
again
the
tent
of
David
that
is
fallen
down
I
will
rebuild
its
ruins
and
restore
it
17
so
that
the
men
who
remain
may
earnestly
seek
Jehovah
together
with
people
of
all
the
nations
people
who
are
called
by
my
name
says
Jehovah
who
is
doing
these
things
18
known
from
of
old
19
Therefore
my
decision
is
not
to
trouble
those
from
the
nations
who
are
turning
to
God
20
but
to
write
them
to
abstain
from
things
polluted
by
idols
from
sexual
immorality
from
what
is
strangled
and
from
blood
21
For
from
ancient
times
Moses
has
had
those
who
preach
him
in
city
after
city
because
he
is
read
aloud
in
the
synagogues
on
every
sabbath
22
Then
the
apostles
and
the
elders
together
with
the
whole
congregation
decided
to
send
chosen
men
from
among
them
to
Antioch
along
with
Paul
and
Barnabas
they
sent
Judas
who
was
called
Barsabbas
and
Silas
who
were
leading
men
among
the
brothers
23
They
wrote
this
and
sent
it
through
them
The
apostles
and
the
elders
your
brothers
to
those
brothers
in
Antioch
Syria
and
Cilicia
who
are
from
the
nations
Greetings
24
Since
we
have
heard
that
some
went
out
from
among
us
and
caused
you
trouble
with
what
they
have
said
trying
to
subvert
you
although
we
did
not
give
them
any
instructions
25
we
have
come
to
a
unanimous
decision
to
choose
men
to
send
to
you
together
with
our
beloved
Barnabas
and
Paul
26
men
who
have
given
up
their
lives
for
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
27
We
are
therefore
sending
Judas
and
Silas
so
that
they
also
may
report
the
same
things
by
word
of
mouth
28
For
the
holy
spirit
and
we
ourselves
have
favored
adding
no
further
burden
to
you
except
these
necessary
things
29
to
keep
abstaining
from
things
sacrificed
to
idols
from
blood
from
what
is
strangled
and
from
sexual
immorality
If
you
carefully
keep
yourselves
from
these
things
you
will
prosper
Good
health
to
you
30
So
when
these
men
were
dismissed
they
went
down
to
Antioch
and
they
gathered
the
whole
group
together
and
handed
them
the
letter
31
After
reading
it
they
rejoiced
over
the
encouragement
32
And
Judas
and
Silas
since
they
were
also
prophets
encouraged
the
brothers
with
many
talks
and
strengthened
them
33
After
they
had
spent
some
time
there
they
were
sent
off
in
peace
by
the
brothers
to
those
who
had
sent
them
34
——
35
But
Paul
and
Barnabas
stayed
in
Antioch
teaching
and
declaring
along
with
many
others
the
good
news
of
the
word
of
Jehovah
36
After
some
days
Paul
said
to
Barnabas
Let
us
now
return
and
visit
the
brothers
in
every
one
of
the
cities
where
we
proclaimed
the
word
of
Jehovah
to
see
how
they
are
37
Barnabas
was
determined
to
take
along
John
who
was
called
Mark
38
Paul
however
was
not
in
favor
of
taking
him
along
with
them
seeing
that
he
had
departed
from
them
in
Pamphylia
and
had
not
gone
with
them
to
the
work
39
At
this
there
was
a
sharp
burst
of
anger
so
that
they
separated
from
each
other
and
Barnabas
took
Mark
along
and
sailed
away
to

Paul
selected
Silas
and
departed
after
he
had
been
entrusted
by
the
brothers
to
the
undeserved
kindness
of
Jehovah
41
He
went
through
Syria
and
Cilicia
strengthening
the
congregations
1
So
he
arrived
at
Derbe
and
also
at
Lystra
And
a
disciple
named
Timothy
was
there
the
son
of
a
believing
Jewish
woman
but
of
a
Greek
father
2
and
he
was
well-reported-on
by
the
brothers
in
Lystra
and
Iconium
3
Paul
expressed
the
desire
for
Timothy
to
accompany
him
and
he
took
him
and
circumcised
him
because
of
the
Jews
in
those
places
for
they
all
knew
that
his
father
was
a
Greek
4
As
they
traveled
on
through
the
cities
they
would
deliver
to
them
for
observance
the
decrees
that
had
been
decided
on
by
the
apostles
and
the
elders
who
were
in
Jerusalem
5
Then
indeed
the
congregations
continued
to
be
made
firm
in
the
faith
and
to
increase
in
number
day
by
day
6
Moreover
they
traveled
through
Phrygia
and
the
country
of
Galatia
because
they
were
forbidden
by
the
holy
spirit
to
speak
the
word
in
the
province
of
Asia
7
Further
when
they
came
down
to
Mysia
they
made
efforts
to
go
into
Bithynia
but
the
spirit
of
Jesus
did
not
permit
them
8
So
they
passed
by
Mysia
and
came
down
to
Troas
9
And
during
the
night
a
vision
appeared
to
Paul—a
Macedonian
man
was
standing
there
urging
him
and
saying
Step
over
into
Macedonia
and
help
us
10
As
soon
as
he
had
seen
the
vision
we
tried
to
go
into
Macedonia
drawing
the
conclusion
that
God
had
summoned
us
to
declare
the
good
news
to
them
11
So
we
put
out
to
sea
from
Troas
and
made
a
straight
run
to
Samothrace
but
on
the
following
day
to
Neapolis
12
and
from
there
we
went
to
Philippi
a
colony
which
is
the
principal
city
of
the
district
of
Macedonia
We
stayed
in
this
city
for
some
days
13
On
the
Sabbath
day
we
went
outside
the
gate
beside
a
river
where
we
thought
there
was
a
place
of
prayer
and
we
sat
down
and
began
speaking
to
the
women
who
had
assembled
14
And
a
woman
named
Lydia
a
seller
of
purple
from
the
city
of
Thyatira
and
a
worshipper
of
God
was
listening
and
Jehovah
opened
her
heart
wide
to
pay
attention
to
the
things
Paul
was
saying
15
Now
when
she
and
her
household
got
baptized
she
urged
us
If
you
have
considered
me
to
be
faithful
to
Jehovah
come
and
stay
at
my
house
And
she
just
made
us
come
16
Now
it
happened
that
as
we
were
going
to
the
place
of
prayer
a
servant
girl
with
a
spirit
a
demon
of
divination
met
us
She
supplied
her
masters
with
much
profit
by
fortune-telling
17
This
girl
kept
following
Paul
and
us
and
crying
out
with
the
words
These
men
are
slaves
of
the
Most
High
God
and
are
proclaiming
to
you
the
way
of
salvation
18
She
kept
doing
this
for
many
days
Finally
Paul
got
tired
of
it
and
turned
and
said
to
the
spirit
I
order
you
in
the
name
of
Jesus
Christ
to
come
out
of
her
And
it
came
out
that
very
hour
19
Well
when
her
masters
saw
that
their
hope
of
profit
was
gone
they
seized
Paul
and
Silas
and
dragged
them
into
the
marketplace
to
the
rulers
20
Leading
them
up
to
the
civil
magistrates
they
said
These
men
are
disturbing
our
city
very
much
They
are
Jews
21
and
they
are
proclaiming
customs
that
it
is
not
lawful
for
us
to
adopt
or
practice
seeing
that
we
are
Romans
22
And
the
crowd
rose
up
together
against
them
and
the
civil
magistrates
after
tearing
the
garments
off
them
gave
the
command
to
beat
them
with
rods
23
After
they
had
inflicted
many
blows
on
them
they
threw
them
into
prison
and
ordered
the
jailer
to
guard
them
securely
24
Because
he
got
such
an
order
he
threw
them
into
the
inner
prison
and
fastened
their
feet
in
the
stocks
25
But
about
the
middle
of
the
night
Paul
and
Silas
were
praying
and
praising
God
with
song
and
the
prisoners
were
listening
to
them
26
Suddenly
a
great
earthquake
occurred
so
that
the
foundations
of
the
jail
were
shaken
Moreover
all
the
doors
were
instantly
opened
and
everyones
bonds
came
loose
27
When
the
jailer
woke
up
and
saw
that
the
prison
doors
were
open
he
drew
his
sword
and
was
about
to
kill
himself
assuming
that
the
prisoners
had
escaped
28
But
Paul
called
out
with
a
loud
voice
Do
not
hurt
yourself
for
we
are
all
here
29
So
he
asked
for
lights
and
rushed
in
and
seized
with
trembling
he
fell
down
before
Paul
and
Silas
30
He
brought
them
outside
and
said
Sirs
what
must
I
do
to
get
saved
31
They
said
Believe
in
the
Lord
Jesus
and
you
will
get
saved
you
and
your
household
32
Then
they
spoke
the
word
of
Jehovah
to
him
together
with
all
those
in
his
house
33
And
he
took
them
along
in
that
hour
of
the
night
and
washed
their
wounds
Then
he
and
his
entire
household
were
baptized
without
delay
34
He
brought
them
into
his
house
and
set
a
table
before
them
and
he
rejoiced
greatly
with
all
his
household
now
that
he
had
believed
in
God
35
When
it
became
day
the
civil
magistrates
sent
the
constables
to
say
Release
those
men
36
The
jailer
reported
their
words
to
Paul
The
civil
magistrates
have
sent
men
to
have
you
two
released
So
come
out
now
and
go
in
peace
37
But
Paul
said
to
them
They
flogged
us
publicly
uncondemned
though
we
are
Romans
and
threw
us
into
prison
Are
they
now
throwing
us
out
secretly
No
indeed
Let
them
come
themselves
and
escort
us
out
38
The
constables
reported
these
words
to
the
civil
magistrates
These
grew
fearful
when
they
heard
that
the
men
were
Romans
39
So
they
came
and
pleaded
with
them
and
after
escorting
them
out
they
requested
them
to
depart
from
the
city
40
But
they
came
out
of
the
prison
and
went
to
the
home
of
Lydia
and
when
they
saw
the
brothers
they
encouraged
them
and
departed
1
They
now
traveled
through
Amphipolis
and
Apollonia
and
came
to
Thessalonica
where
there
was
a
synagogue
of
the
Jews
2
So
according
to
Pauls
custom
he
went
inside
to
them
and
for
three
sabbaths
he
reasoned
with
them
from
the
Scriptures
3
explaining
and
proving
by
references
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
Christ
to
suffer
and
to
rise
from
the
dead
saying
This
is
the
Christ
this
Jesus
whom
I
am
proclaiming
to
you
4
As
a
result
some
of
them
became
believers
and
associated
themselves
with
Paul
and
Silas
and
so
did
a
great
multitude
of
the
Greeks
who
worshipped
God
along
with
quite
a
few
of
the
principal
women
5
But
the
Jews
getting
jealous
gathered
together
some
wicked
men
who
were
loitering
at
the
marketplace
and
formed
a
mob
and
proceeded
to
throw
the
city
into
an
uproar
They
assaulted
the
house
of
Jason
and
were
seeking
to
have
Paul
and
Silas
brought
out
to
the
mob
6
When
they
did
not
find
them
they
dragged
Jason
and
some
of
the
brothers
to
the
city
rulers
crying
out
These
men
who
have
overturned
the
inhabited
earth
are
present
here
also
7
and
Jason
has
received
them
as
his
guests
All
these
men
act
in
opposition
to
the
decrees
of
Caesar
saying
there
is
another
king
Jesus
8
When
they
heard
these
things
the
crowd
and
the
city
rulers
were
alarmed
9
and
after
taking
sufficient
security
from
Jason
and
the
others
they
let
them
go
10
Immediately
by
night
the
brothers
sent
both
Paul
and
Silas
to
Beroea
On
arriving
they
went
into
the
synagogue
of
the
Jews
11
Now
these
were
more
noble-minded
than
those
in
Thessalonica
for
they
accepted
the
word
with
the
greatest
eagerness
of
mind
carefully
examining
the
Scriptures
daily
to
see
whether
these
things
were
so
12
Therefore
many
of
them
became
believers
and
so
did
quite
a
few
of
the
reputable
Greek
women
as
well
as
some
of
the
men
13
But
when
the
Jews
from
Thessalonica
learned
that
the
word
of
God
was
also
being
proclaimed
by
Paul
in
Beroea
they
came
there
to
incite
and
agitate
the
crowds
14
Then
the
brothers
immediately
sent
Paul
away
to
the
sea
but
both
Silas
and
Timothy
remained
behind
there
15
However
those
accompanying
Paul
brought
him
as
far
as
Athens
and
they
departed
after
receiving
instructions
that
Silas
and
Timothy
should
come
to
Paul
as
quickly
as
possible
16
Now
while
Paul
was
waiting
for
them
in
Athens
his
spirit
within
him
became
irritated
on
seeing
that
the
city
was
full
of
idols
17
So
he
began
to
reason
in
the
synagogue
with
the
Jews
and
the
other
people
who
worshipped
God
and
every
day
in
the
marketplace
with
those
who
happened
to
be
on
hand
18
But
some
of
both
the
Epicurean
and
the
Stoic
philosophers
began
disputing
with
him
and
some
were
saying
What
is
it
this
chatterer
would
like
to
tell
Others
He
seems
to
be
a
proclaimer
of
foreign
deities
This
was
because
he
was
declaring
the
good
news
of
Jesus
and
the
resurrection
19
So
they
took
hold
of
him
and
led
him
to
the
Areopagus
saying
Can
we
get
to
know
what
this
new
teaching
is
that
you
are
speaking
about
20
For
you
are
introducing
some
things
that
are
strange
to
our
ears
and
we
want
to
know
what
these
things
mean
21
In
fact
all
Athenians
and
the
foreigners
staying
there
would
spend
their
leisure
time
doing
nothing
else
but
telling
or
listening
to
something
new
22
Paul
now
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
Areopagus
and
said
Men
of
Athens
I
see
that
in
all
things
you
seem
to
be
more
given
to
the
fear
of
the
deities
than
others
are
23
For
instance
while
passing
along
and
carefully
observing
your
objects
of
veneration
I
found
even
an
altar
on
which
had
been
inscribed
To
an
Unknown
God
Therefore
what
you
are
unknowingly
worshipping
this
I
am
declaring
to
you
24
The
God
who
made
the
world
and
all
the
things
in
it
being
as
he
is
Lord
of
heaven
and
earth
does
not
dwell
in
handmade
temples
25
nor
is
he
served
by
human
hands
as
if
he
needed
anything
because
he
himself
gives
to
all
people
life
and
breath
and
all
things
26
And
he
made
out
of
one
man
every
nation
of
men
to
dwell
on
the
entire
surface
of
the
earth
and
he
decreed
the
appointed
times
and
the
set
limits
of
where
men
would
dwell
27
so
that
they
would
seek
God
if
they
might
grope
for
him
and
really
find
him
although
in
fact
he
is
not
far
off
from
each
one
of
us
28
For
by
him
we
have
life
and
move
and
exist
even
as
some
of
your
own
poets
have
said
For
we
are
also
his
children
29
Therefore
since
we
are
the
children
of
God
we
should
not
think
that
the
Divine
Being
is
like
gold
or
silver
or
stone
like
something
sculptured
by
the
art
and
design
of
humans
30
True
God
has
overlooked
the
times
of
such
ignorance
but
now
he
is
declaring
to
all
people
everywhere
that
they
should
repent
31
Because
he
has
set
a
day
on
which
he
purposes
to
judge
the
inhabited
earth
in
righteousness
by
a
man
whom
he
has
appointed
and
he
has
provided
a
guarantee
to
all
men
by
resurrecting
him
from
the
dead
32
Now
when
they
heard
of
a
resurrection
of
the
dead
some
began
to
scoff
while
others
said
We
will
hear
you
again
about
this
33
So
Paul
left
them
34
but
some
men
joined
him
and
became
believers
Among
them
were
Dionysius
who
was
a
judge
of
the
court
of
the
Areopagus
and
a
woman
named
Damaris
and
others
besides
them
1
After
this
he
departed
from
Athens
and
came
to
Corinth
2
And
he
found
a
Jew
named
Aquila
a
native
of
Pontus
who
had
recently
come
from
Italy
with
Priscilla
his
wife
because
Claudius
had
ordered
all
the
Jews
to
leave
Rome
So
he
went
to
them
3
and
because
he
had
the
same
trade
he
stayed
at
their
home
and
worked
with
them
for
they
were
tentmakers
by
trade
4
He
would
give
a
talk
in
the
synagogue
every
sabbath
and
would
persuade
Jews
and
Greeks
5
When
now
both
Silas
and
Timothy
came
down
from
Macedonia
Paul
began
to
be
intensely
occupied
with
the
word
witnessing
to
the
Jews
to
prove
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
6
But
after
they
kept
on
opposing
him
and
speaking
abusively
he
shook
out
his
garments
and
said
to
them
Let
your
blood
be
on
your
own
heads
I
am
clean
From
now
on
I
will
go
to
people
of
the
nations
7
So
he
transferred
from
there
and
went
into
the
house
of
a
man
named
Titius
Justus
a
worshipper
of
God
whose
house
adjoined
the
synagogue
8
But
Crispus
the
presiding
officer
of
the
synagogue
became
a
believer
in
the
Lord
along
with
all
his
household
And
many
of
the
Corinthians
who
heard
began
to
believe
and
be
baptized
9
Moreover
the
Lord
said
to
Paul
in
a
vision
by
night
Do
not
be
afraid
but
keep
on
speaking
and
do
not
keep
silent
10
for
I
am
with
you
and
no
man
will
assault
you
to
harm
you
for
I
have
many
people
in
this
city
11
So
he
stayed
there
for
a
year
and
six
months
teaching
the
word
of
God
among
them
12
While
Gallio
was
proconsul
of
Achaia
the
Jews
made
a
concerted
attack
against
Paul
and
led
him
to
the
judgment
seat
13
saying
This
man
is
persuading
people
to
worship
God
in
a
way
contrary
to
the
law
14
But
as
Paul
was
about
to
speak
Gallio
said
to
the
Jews
If
indeed
it
were
some
wrong
or
a
serious
crime
O
Jews
it
would
be
reasonable
for
me
to
hear
you
out
patiently
15
But
if
it
is
controversies
over
speech
and
names
and
your
own
law
you
yourselves
must
see
to
it
I
do
not
wish
to
be
a
judge
of
these
things
16
With
that
he
drove
them
away
from
the
judgment
seat
17
So
they
all
seized
Sosthenes
the
presiding
officer
of
the
synagogue
and
began
beating
him
in
front
of
the
judgment
seat
But
Gallio
would
not
get
involved
at
all
with
these
things
18
However
after
staying
quite
a
few
days
longer
Paul
said
good-bye
to
the
brothers
and
sailed
away
for
Syria
accompanied
by
Priscilla
and
Aquila
He
had
his
hair
clipped
short
in
Cenchreae
for
he
had
made
a
vow
19
So
they
arrived
at
Ephesus
and
he
left
them
there
but
he
entered
the
synagogue
and
reasoned
with
the
Jews
20
Although
they
kept
requesting
him
to
stay
longer
he
would
not
consent
21
but
said
good-bye
and
told
them
I
will
return
to
you
again
if
Jehovah
is
willing
And
he
put
out
to
sea
from
Ephesus
22
and
came
down
to
Caesarea
And
he
went
up
and
greeted
the
congregation
and
then
went
down
to
Antioch
23
After
spending
some
time
there
he
departed
and
went
from
place
to
place
through
the
country
of
Galatia
and
Phrygia
strengthening
all
the
disciples
24
Now
a
Jew
named
Apollos
a
native
of
Alexandria
arrived
in
Ephesus
he
was
an
eloquent
man
who
was
well-versed
in
the
Scriptures
25
This
man
had
been
instructed
in
the
way
of
Jehovah
and
aglow
with
the
spirit
he
was
speaking
and
teaching
accurately
the
things
about
Jesus
but
he
was
acquainted
only
with
the
baptism
of
John
26
He
began
to
speak
boldly
in
the
synagogue
and
when
Priscilla
and
Aquila
heard
him
they
took
him
into
their
company
and
explained
the
way
of
God
more
accurately
to
him
27
Further
because
he
wanted
to
go
across
to
Achaia
the
brothers
wrote
to
the
disciples
urging
them
to
receive
him
kindly
So
when
he
got
there
he
greatly
helped
those
who
through
Gods
undeserved
kindness
had
become
believers
28
for
publicly
and
with
great
intensity
he
thoroughly
proved
the
Jews
to
be
wrong
showing
them
from
the
Scriptures
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
1
In
the
course
of
events
while
Apollos
was
in
Corinth
Paul
went
through
the
inland
regions
and
came
down
to
Ephesus
There
he
found
some
disciples
2
and
said
to
them
Did
you
receive
holy
spirit
when
you
became
believers
They
replied
to
him
Why
we
have
never
heard
that
there
is
a
holy
spirit
3
So
he
said
In
what
then
were
you
baptized
They
said
In
Johns
baptism
4
Paul
said
John
baptized
with
the
baptism
in
symbol
of
repentance
telling
the
people
to
believe
in
the
one
coming
after
him
that
is
in
Jesus
5
On
hearing
this
they
got
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus
6
And
when
Paul
laid
his
hands
on
them
the
holy
spirit
came
upon
them
and
they
began
speaking
in
foreign
languages
and
prophesying
7
There
were
about
12
men
in
all
8
Entering
the
synagogue
for
three
months
he
spoke
with
boldness
giving
talks
and
reasoning
persuasively
about
the
Kingdom
of
God
9
But
when
some
stubbornly
refused
to
believe
speaking
injuriously
about
The
Way
before
the
crowd
he
withdrew
from
them
and
separated
the
disciples
from
them
giving
talks
daily
in
the
school
auditorium
of
Tyrannus
10
This
went
on
for
two
years
so
that
all
those
living
in
the
province
of
Asia
heard
the
word
of
the
Lord
both
Jews
and
Greeks
11
And
God
kept
performing
extraordinary
powerful
works
through
the
hands
of
Paul
12
so
that
even
cloths
and
aprons
that
had
touched
his
body
were
carried
to
the
sick
and
the
diseases
left
them
and
the
wicked
spirits
came
out
13
But
some
of
the
Jews
who
traveled
around
casting
out
demons
also
tried
to
use
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus
over
those
who
had
wicked
spirits
they
would
say
I
solemnly
charge
you
by
Jesus
whom
Paul
preaches
14
Now
there
were
seven
sons
of
a
Jewish
chief
priest
named
Sceva
doing
this
15
But
in
answer
the
wicked
spirit
said
to
them
I
know
Jesus
and
I
am
acquainted
with
Paul
but
who
are
you
16
At
that
the
man
with
the
wicked
spirit
leaped
on
them
overpowered
them
one
after
the
other
and
prevailed
against
them
so
that
they
fled
naked
and
wounded
out
of
that
house
17
This
became
known
to
all
both
the
Jews
and
the
Greeks
who
lived
in
Ephesus
and
fear
fell
upon
them
all
and
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus
went
on
being
magnified
18
And
many
of
those
who
had
become
believers
would
come
and
confess
and
report
their
practices
openly
19
Indeed
quite
a
number
of
those
who
practiced
magical
arts
brought
their
books
together
and
burned
them
up
before
everybody
And
they
calculated
their
value
and
found
them
worth
50000
pieces
of
silver
20
Thus
in
a
mighty
way
the
word
of
Jehovah
kept
growing
and
prevailing
21
After
these
things
had
taken
place
Paul
resolved
in
his
spirit
that
after
going
through
Macedonia
and
Achaia
he
would
travel
to
Jerusalem
He
said
After
going
there
I
must
also
see
Rome
22
So
he
sent
to
Macedonia
two
of
those
who
ministered
to
him
Timothy
and
Erastus
but
he
himself
stayed
on
for
some
time
in
the
province
of
Asia
23
At
that
time
quite
a
disturbance
arose
concerning
The
Way
24
For
a
man
named
Demetrius
a
silversmith
who
made
silver
shrines
of
Artemis
brought
considerable
profit
to
the
craftsmen
25
He
gathered
them
and
others
who
worked
at
such
things
and
said
Men
you
well
know
that
from
this
business
comes
our
prosperity
26
Now
you
see
and
hear
how
not
only
in
Ephesus
but
in
nearly
all
the
province
of
Asia
this
Paul
has
persuaded
a
considerable
crowd
and
turned
them
to
another
opinion
saying
that
the
gods
made
by
hands
are
not
really
gods
27
Moreover
the
danger
exists
not
only
that
this
business
of
ours
will
come
into
disrepute
but
also
that
the
temple
of
the
great
goddess
Artemis
will
be
viewed
as
nothing
and
she
who
is
worshipped
in
the
whole
province
of
Asia
and
the
inhabited
earth
will
be
deprived
of
her
magnificence
28
Hearing
this
and
becoming
full
of
anger
the
men
began
crying
out
Great
is
Artemis
of
the
Ephesians
29
So
the
city
became
filled
with
confusion
and
all
together
they
rushed
into
the
theater
dragging
along
with
them
Gaius
and
Aristarchus
Macedonians
traveling
companions
of
Paul
30
For
his
part
Paul
was
willing
to
go
inside
to
the
people
but
the
disciples
would
not
permit
him
31
Even
some
of
the
commissioners
of
festivals
and
games
who
were
friendly
to
him
sent
word
to
him
pleading
with
him
not
to
risk
going
into
the
theater
32
Some
were
in
fact
crying
out
one
thing
and
others
something
else
for
the
assembly
was
in
confusion
and
the
majority
of
them
did
not
know
the
reason
why
they
had
come
together
33
So
they
brought
Alexander
out
of
the
crowd
the
Jews
shoving
him
forward
and
Alexander
motioned
with
his
hand
and
wanted
to
make
his
defense
to
the
people
34
But
when
they
recognized
that
he
was
a
Jew
they
all
started
shouting
in
unison
for
about
two
hours
Great
is
Artemis
of
the
Ephesians
35
When
the
city
recorder
had
finally
quieted
the
crowd
he
said
Men
of
Ephesus
who
really
is
there
among
men
who
does
not
know
that
the
city
of
the
Ephesians
is
the
temple
keeper
of
the
great
Artemis
and
of
the
image
that
fell
from
heaven
36
Since
these
things
are
indisputable
you
should
keep
calm
and
not
act
rashly
37
For
you
have
brought
these
men
here
who
are
neither
robbers
of
temples
nor
blasphemers
of
our
goddess
38
So
if
Demetrius
and
the
craftsmen
with
him
do
have
a
case
against
someone
court
days
are
held
and
there
are
proconsuls
let
them
bring
charges
against
one
another
39
But
if
you
are
searching
for
anything
beyond
that
it
must
be
decided
in
a
regular
assembly
40
For
we
are
really
in
danger
of
being
charged
with
sedition
over
todays
affair
since
there
are
no
grounds
we
could
present
as
a
reason
for
this
disorderly
mob
41
And
after
saying
this
he
dismissed
the
assembly
1
When
the
uproar
had
subsided
Paul
sent
for
the
disciples
and
after
he
had
encouraged
them
and
said
farewell
he
began
his
journey
to
Macedonia
2
After
going
through
those
regions
and
giving
many
words
of
encouragement
to
the
ones
there
he
arrived
in
Greece
3
He
spent
three
months
there
but
because
a
plot
was
hatched
against
him
by
the
Jews
when
he
was
about
to
set
sail
for
Syria
he
made
up
his
mind
to
return
through
Macedonia
4
He
was
accompanied
by
Sopater
the
son
of
Pyrrhus
of
Beroea
Aristarchus
and
Secundus
of
the
Thessalonians
Gaius
of
Derbe
Timothy
and
from
the
province
of
Asia
Tychicus
and
Trophimus
5
These
men
went
on
ahead
and
were
waiting
for
us
in
Troas
6
but
we
put
out
to
sea
from
Philippi
after
the
days
of
the
Unleavened
Bread
and
within
five
days
we
came
to
them
in
Troas
and
there
we
spent
seven
days
7
On
the
first
day
of
the
week
when
we
were
gathered
together
to
have
a
meal
Paul
began
addressing
them
as
he
was
going
to
depart
the
next
day
and
he
prolonged
his
speech
until
midnight
8
So
there
were
quite
a
few
lamps
in
the
upper
room
where
we
were
gathered
together
9
Seated
at
the
window
a
young
man
named
Eutychus
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
while
Paul
kept
talking
and
overcome
by
sleep
he
fell
down
from
the
third
story
and
was
picked
up
dead
10
But
Paul
went
downstairs
threw
himself
on
him
and
embraced
him
and
said
Stop
making
a
commotion
for
he
is
alive
11
He
then
went
upstairs
and
began
the
meal
and
ate
He
continued
conversing
for
quite
a
while
until
daybreak
and
then
he
departed
12
So
they
took
the
boy
away
alive
and
were
comforted
beyond
measure
13
We
now
went
ahead
to
the
ship
and
set
sail
for
Assos
where
we
were
intending
to
take
Paul
aboard
for
after
giving
instructions
to
this
effect
he
was
intending
to
go
there
on
foot
14
So
when
he
caught
up
with
us
in
Assos
we
took
him
aboard
and
went
to
Mitylene
15
And
sailing
away
from
there
the
next
day
we
arrived
off
Chios
but
the
day
after
that
we
touched
at
Samos
and
on
the
following
day
we
arrived
at
Miletus
16
Paul
had
decided
to
sail
past
Ephesus
so
as
not
to
spend
any
time
in
the
province
of
Asia
for
he
was
hurrying
to
get
to
Jerusalem
on
the
day
of
the
Festival
of
Pentecost
if
he
possibly
could
17
However
from
Miletus
he
sent
word
to
Ephesus
and
called
for
the
elders
of
the
congregation
18
When
they
came
to
him
he
said
to
them
You
well
know
how
I
conducted
myself
among
you
from
the
first
day
I
stepped
into
the
province
of
Asia
19
slaving
for
the
Lord
with
all
humility
and
with
tears
and
trials
that
befell
me
by
the
plots
of
the
Jews
20
while
I
did
not
hold
back
from
telling
you
any
of
the
things
that
were
profitable
nor
from
teaching
you
publicly
and
from
house
to
house
21
But
I
thoroughly
bore
witness
both
to
Jews
and
to
Greeks
about
repentance
toward
God
and
faith
in
our
Lord
Jesus
22
And
now
look
bound
in
the
spirit
I
am
traveling
to
Jerusalem
although
not
knowing
what
will
happen
to
me
there
23
except
that
from
city
to
city
the
holy
spirit
repeatedly
bears
witness
to
me
saying
that
imprisonment
and
tribulations
are
waiting
for
me
24
Nevertheless
I
do
not
consider
my
own
life
of
any
importance
to
me
if
only
I
may
finish
my
course
and
the
ministry
that
I
received
from
the
Lord
Jesus
to
bear
thorough
witness
to
the
good
news
of
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
25
And
now
look
I
know
that
none
of
you
among
whom
I
preached
the
Kingdom
will
ever
see
my
face
again
26
So
I
call
you
to
witness
this
very
day
that
I
am
clean
from
the
blood
of
all
men
27
for
I
have
not
held
back
from
telling
you
all
the
counsel
of
God
28
Pay
attention
to
yourselves
and
to
all
the
flock
among
which
the
holy
spirit
has
appointed
you
overseers
to
shepherd
the
congregation
of
God
which
he
purchased
with
the
blood
of
his
own
Son
29
I
know
that
after
my
going
away
oppressive
wolves
will
enter
in
among
you
and
will
not
treat
the
flock
with
tenderness
30
and
from
among
you
yourselves
men
will
rise
and
speak
twisted
things
to
draw
away
the
disciples
after
themselves
31
Therefore
keep
awake
and
bear
in
mind
that
for
three
years
night
and
day
I
never
stopped
admonishing
each
one
of
you
with
tears
32
And
now
I
entrust
you
to
God
and
to
the
word
of
his
undeserved
kindness
which
word
can
build
you
up
and
give
you
the
inheritance
among
all
the
sanctified
ones
33
I
have
desired
no
mans
silver
or
gold
or
clothing
34
You
yourselves
know
that
these
hands
have
provided
for
my
own
needs
and
the
needs
of
those
with
me
35
I
have
shown
you
in
all
things
that
by
working
hard
in
this
way
you
must
assist
those
who
are
weak
and
must
keep
in
mind
the
words
of
the
Lord
Jesus
when
he
himself
said
There
is
more
happiness
in
giving
than
there
is
in
receiving
36
And
when
he
had
said
these
things
he
knelt
down
with
all
of
them
and
prayed
37
Indeed
quite
a
bit
of
weeping
broke
out
among
them
all
and
they
embraced
Paul
and
affectionately
kissed
him
38
for
they
were
especially
pained
at
the
word
he
had
spoken
that
they
would
not
see
his
face
anymore
Then
they
accompanied
him
to
the
ship
1
After
tearing
ourselves
away
from
them
and
putting
out
to
sea
we
ran
with
a
straight
course
and
came
to
Cos
on
the
next
day
to
Rhodes
and
from
there
to
Patara
2
When
we
found
a
ship
that
was
crossing
to
Phoenicia
we
went
aboard
and
sailed
away
3
After
coming
in
sight
of
the
island
of
Cyprus
we
left
it
behind
on
the
left
side
and
sailed
on
to
Syria
and
landed
at
Tyre
where
the
ship
was
to
unload
its
cargo
4
We
searched
for
and
found
the
disciples
and
remained
there
for
seven
days
But
through
the
spirit
they
repeatedly
told
Paul
not
to
set
foot
in
Jerusalem
5
So
when
our
time
there
was
over
we
left
and
started
on
our
way
but
they
all
together
with
the
women
and
children
accompanied
us
until
we
were
outside
the
city
And
kneeling
down
on
the
beach
we
prayed
6
and
said
good-bye
to
one
another
Then
we
went
aboard
the
ship
and
they
returned
to
their
homes
7
We
then
completed
the
voyage
from
Tyre
and
arrived
at
Ptolemais
and
we
greeted
the
brothers
and
stayed
one
day
with
them
8
The
next
day
we
left
and
came
to
Caesarea
and
we
entered
the
house
of
Philip
the
evangelizer
who
was
one
of
the
seven
men
and
we
stayed
with
him
9
This
man
had
four
unmarried
daughters
who
prophesied
10
But
after
we
had
stayed
there
for
quite
a
number
of
days
a
prophet
named
Agabus
came
down
from
Judea
11
And
he
came
to
us
and
took
Pauls
belt
and
tied
his
own
feet
and
hands
and
said
Thus
says
the
holy
spirit
The
man
to
whom
this
belt
belongs
will
be
bound
like
this
by
the
Jews
in
Jerusalem
and
they
will
give
him
into
the
hands
of
people
of
the
nations
12
Now
when
we
heard
this
both
we
and
those
who
were
there
began
begging
him
not
to
go
up
to
Jerusalem
13
Then
Paul
answered
What
are
you
doing
by
weeping
and
trying
to
weaken
my
resolve
Rest
assured
I
am
ready
not
only
to
be
bound
but
also
to
die
at
Jerusalem
for
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus
14
When
he
would
not
be
dissuaded
we
stopped
objecting
and
said
Let
the
will
of
Jehovah
take
place
15
Now
after
these
days
we
prepared
for
the
journey
and
started
on
our
way
to
Jerusalem
16
Some
of
the
disciples
from
Caesarea
also
went
with
us
taking
us
to
Mnason
of
Cyprus
an
early
disciple
at
whose
home
we
were
to
be
guests
17
When
we
got
to
Jerusalem
the
brothers
welcomed
us
gladly
18
But
on
the
following
day
Paul
went
in
with
us
to
James
and
all
the
elders
were
present
19
And
he
greeted
them
and
began
giving
a
detailed
account
of
the
things
God
did
among
the
nations
through
his
ministry
20
After
hearing
this
they
began
to
glorify
God
but
they
said
to
him
You
see
brother
how
many
thousands
of
believers
there
are
among
the
Jews
and
they
are
all
zealous
for
the
Law
21
But
they
have
heard
it
rumored
about
you
that
you
have
been
teaching
all
the
Jews
among
the
nations
an
apostasy
from
Moses
telling
them
not
to
circumcise
their
children
or
to
follow
the
customary
practices
22
What
then
is
to
be
done
about
it
They
are
certainly
going
to
hear
that
you
have
arrived
23
So
do
what
we
tell
you
We
have
four
men
who
have
put
themselves
under
a
vow
24
Take
these
men
with
you
and
cleanse
yourself
ceremonially
together
with
them
and
take
care
of
their
expenses
so
that
they
may
have
their
heads
shaved
Then
everyone
will
know
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
rumors
they
were
told
about
you
but
that
you
are
walking
orderly
and
you
are
also
keeping
the
Law
25
As
for
the
believers
from
among
the
nations
we
have
sent
them
our
decision
in
writing
that
they
should
keep
away
from
what
is
sacrificed
to
idols
as
well
as
from
blood
from
what
is
strangled
and
from
sexual
immorality
26
Then
Paul
took
the
men
the
next
day
and
cleansed
himself
ceremonially
along
with
them
and
he
went
into
the
temple
to
give
notice
of
when
the
days
for
the
ceremonial
cleansing
would
be
completed
and
the
offering
should
be
presented
for
each
one
of
them
27
Now
when
the
seven
days
were
about
to
end
the
Jews
from
Asia
on
seeing
him
in
the
temple
stirred
up
the
whole
crowd
and
they
seized
him
28
shouting
Men
of
Israel
help
This
is
the
man
who
teaches
everyone
everywhere
against
our
people
and
our
Law
and
this
place
And
what
is
more
he
even
brought
Greeks
into
the
temple
and
has
defiled
this
holy
place
29
For
they
had
previously
seen
Trophimus
the
Ephesian
in
the
city
with
him
and
they
assumed
that
Paul
had
brought
him
into
the
temple
30
The
whole
city
was
in
an
uproar
and
the
people
came
running
together
and
seized
Paul
and
dragged
him
outside
the
temple
and
immediately
the
doors
were
closed
31
While
they
were
trying
to
kill
him
word
reached
the
commander
of
the
army
unit
that
all
Jerusalem
was
in
confusion
32
and
he
immediately
took
soldiers
and
army
officers
and
ran
down
to
them
When
they
caught
sight
of
the
military
commander
and
the
soldiers
they
stopped
beating
Paul
33
Then
the
military
commander
came
near
and
took
him
into
custody
and
ordered
that
he
be
bound
with
two
chains
then
he
inquired
who
he
was
and
what
he
had
done
34
But
some
in
the
crowd
began
shouting
out
one
thing
and
others
something
else
So
being
unable
himself
to
learn
anything
for
certain
because
of
the
disturbance
he
commanded
him
to
be
brought
to
the
soldiers
quarters
35
But
when
he
reached
the
stairs
he
had
to
be
carried
by
the
soldiers
because
of
the
violence
of
the
crowd
36
for
a
crowd
of
the
people
kept
following
crying
out
Do
away
with
him
37
As
he
was
about
to
be
led
into
the
soldiers
quarters
Paul
said
to
the
military
commander
Am
I
allowed
to
say
something
to
you
He
said
Can
you
speak
Greek
38
Are
you
not
then
the
Egyptian
who
some
time
ago
stirred
up
a
sedition
and
led
the
4000
dagger
men
out
into
the
wilderness
39
Then
Paul
said
I
am
in
fact
a
Jew
of
Tarsus
in
Cilicia
a
citizen
of
no
obscure
city
So
I
beg
you
permit
me
to
speak
to
the
people
40
After
he
gave
permission
Paul
standing
on
the
stairs
motioned
with
his
hand
to
the
people
When
a
great
silence
fell
he
addressed
them
in
the
Hebrew
language
saying
1
Men
brothers
and
fathers
hear
my
defense
to
you
now
2
Well
when
they
heard
that
he
was
addressing
them
in
the
Hebrew
language
they
kept
all
the
more
silent
and
he
said
3
I
am
a
Jew
born
in
Tarsus
of
Cilicia
but
educated
in
this
city
at
the
feet
of
Gamaliel
instructed
according
to
the
strictness
of
the
ancestral
Law
and
zealous
for
God
just
as
all
of
you
are
this
day
4
I
persecuted
this
Way
to
the
point
of
death
binding
and
handing
over
to
prisons
both
men
and
women
5
as
the
high
priest
and
all
the
assembly
of
elders
can
bear
witness
From
them
I
also
obtained
letters
to
the
brothers
in
Damascus
and
I
was
on
my
way
to
bring
those
who
were
there
in
bonds
to
Jerusalem
to
be
punished
6
But
as
I
was
traveling
and
getting
near
to
Damascus
about
midday
suddenly
out
of
heaven
a
great
light
flashed
all
around
me
7
and
I
fell
to
the
ground
and
heard
a
voice
say
to
me
Saul
Saul
why
are
you
persecuting
me
8
I
answered
Who
are
you
Lord
And
he
said
to
me
I
am
Jesus
the
Nazarene
whom
you
are
persecuting
9
Now
the
men
who
were
with
me
did
see
the
light
but
they
did
not
hear
the
voice
of
the
one
speaking
to
me
10
At
that
I
said
What
should
I
do
Lord
The
Lord
said
to
me
Rise
go
into
Damascus
and
there
you
will
be
told
about
everything
it
is
appointed
for
you
to
do
11
But
since
I
could
not
see
anything
because
of
the
glory
of
that
light
I
arrived
in
Damascus
led
by
the
hand
of
those
who
were
with
me
12
Then
a
man
named
Ananias
a
devout
man
according
to
the
Law
well-reported-on
by
all
the
Jews
living
there
13
came
to
me
He
stood
by
me
and
said
to
me
Saul
brother
regain
your
sight
And
that
very
moment
I
looked
up
and
saw
him
14
He
said
The
God
of
our
forefathers
has
chosen
you
to
come
to
know
his
will
and
to
see
the
righteous
one
and
to
hear
the
voice
of
his
mouth
15
because
you
are
to
be
a
witness
for
him
to
all
men
of
the
things
you
have
seen
and
heard
16
And
now
why
are
you
delaying
Rise
get
baptized
and
wash
your
sins
away
by
your
calling
on
his
name
17
But
when
I
had
returned
to
Jerusalem
and
was
praying
in
the
temple
I
fell
into
a
trance
18
and
saw
him
saying
to
me
Hurry
up
and
get
out
of
Jerusalem
quickly
because
they
will
not
accept
your
witness
concerning
me
19
And
I
said
Lord
they
themselves
well
know
that
I
used
to
imprison
and
flog
in
one
synagogue
after
another
those
believing
in
you
20
and
when
the
blood
of
Stephen
your
witness
was
being
spilled
I
was
standing
by
and
approving
and
guarding
the
outer
garments
of
those
doing
away
with
him
21
And
yet
he
said
to
me
Go
because
I
will
send
you
out
to
nations
far
away
22
Now
they
kept
listening
to
him
down
to
this
word
Then
they
raised
their
voices
saying
Take
such
a
man
away
from
the
earth
for
he
is
not
fit
to
live
23
Because
they
were
crying
out
throwing
their
outer
garments
about
and
tossing
dust
into
the
air
24
the
military
commander
ordered
Paul
to
be
brought
into
the
soldiers
quarters
and
said
that
he
should
be
interrogated
under
scourging
so
that
he
could
learn
exactly
why
they
were
shouting
against
Paul
this
way
25
But
when
they
had
stretched
him
out
for
the
whipping
Paul
said
to
the
army
officer
standing
there
Is
it
lawful
for
you
to
scourge
a
Roman
who
has
not
been
condemned
26
Well
when
the
army
officer
heard
this
he
went
to
the
military
commander
and
reported
it
saying
What
are
you
intending
to
do
For
this
man
is
a
Roman
27
So
the
military
commander
approached
and
said
to
him
Tell
me
are
you
a
Roman
He
said
Yes
28
The
military
commander
responded
I
purchased
these
rights
as
a
citizen
for
a
large
sum
of
money
Paul
said
But
I
have
them
by
birth
29
Immediately
therefore
the
men
who
were
about
to
interrogate
him
under
torture
backed
away
from
him
and
the
military
commander
became
afraid
when
he
realized
that
he
was
a
Roman
and
that
he
had
bound
him
in
chains
30
So
the
next
day
because
he
wanted
to
know
for
sure
just
why
he
was
being
accused
by
the
Jews
he
released
him
and
commanded
the
chief
priests
and
all
the
Sanhedrin
to
assemble
He
then
brought
Paul
down
and
had
him
stand
among
them
1
Looking
intently
at
the
Sanhedrin
Paul
said
Men
brothers
I
have
behaved
before
God
with
a
perfectly
clear
conscience
down
to
this
day
2
At
this
the
high
priest
Ananias
ordered
those
standing
by
him
to
strike
him
on
the
mouth
3
Then
Paul
said
to
him
God
is
going
to
strike
you
you
whitewashed
wall
Do
you
sit
to
judge
me
according
to
the
Law
and
at
the
same
time
violate
the
Law
by
commanding
me
to
be
struck
4
Those
standing
by
said
Are
you
insulting
the
high
priest
of
God
5
And
Paul
said
Brothers
I
did
not
know
he
was
high
priest
For
it
is
written
You
must
not
speak
injuriously
of
a
ruler
of
your
people
6
Now
Paul
knowing
that
the
one
part
was
made
up
of
Sadducees
but
the
other
of
Pharisees
cried
out
in
the
Sanhedrin
Men
brothers
I
am
a
Pharisee
a
son
of
Pharisees
Over
the
hope
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
I
am
being
judged
7
Because
he
said
this
a
dissension
arose
between
the
Pharisees
and
the
Sadducees
and
the
assembly
was
split
8
For
the
Sadducees
say
that
there
is
neither
resurrection
nor
angel
nor
spirit
but
the
Pharisees
accept
them
all
9
So
a
great
uproar
broke
out
and
some
of
the
scribes
of
the
party
of
the
Pharisees
rose
and
began
arguing
fiercely
saying
We
find
nothing
wrong
in
this
man
but
if
a
spirit
or
an
angel
spoke
to
him—
10
Now
when
the
dissension
grew
great
the
military
commander
feared
that
Paul
would
be
torn
apart
by
them
and
he
commanded
the
soldiers
to
go
down
and
snatch
him
from
their
midst
and
bring
him
into
the
soldiers
quarters
11
But
the
following
night
the
Lord
stood
by
him
and
said
Take
courage
For
just
as
you
have
been
giving
a
thorough
witness
about
me
in
Jerusalem
so
you
must
also
bear
witness
in
Rome
12
When
it
became
day
the
Jews
formed
a
conspiracy
and
bound
themselves
with
a
curse
saying
that
they
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
until
they
had
killed
Paul
13
There
were
more
than
40
men
who
formed
this
oath-bound
conspiracy
14
These
men
went
to
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
and
said
We
have
solemnly
bound
ourselves
with
a
curse
not
to
eat
anything
at
all
until
we
have
killed
Paul
15
So
now
you
together
with
the
Sanhedrin
should
inform
the
military
commander
that
he
should
bring
him
down
to
you
as
though
you
want
to
examine
his
case
more
thoroughly
But
before
he
gets
near
we
will
be
ready
to
do
away
with
him
16
However
the
son
of
Pauls
sister
heard
of
the
ambush
they
were
planning
and
he
entered
the
soldiers
quarters
and
reported
it
to
Paul
17
Paul
then
called
one
of
the
army
officers
to
him
and
said
Take
this
young
man
to
the
military
commander
for
he
has
something
to
report
to
him
18
So
he
brought
him
and
led
him
to
the
military
commander
and
said
The
prisoner
Paul
called
me
and
asked
me
to
bring
this
young
man
to
you
because
he
has
something
to
tell
you
19
The
military
commander
took
him
by
the
hand
and
withdrew
privately
and
asked
him
What
do
you
have
to
report
to
me
20
He
said
The
Jews
have
agreed
to
request
you
to
bring
Paul
down
to
the
Sanhedrin
tomorrow
as
though
they
intend
to
learn
more
details
about
his
case
21
But
do
not
let
them
persuade
you
for
more
than
40
of
their
men
are
waiting
to
ambush
him
and
they
have
bound
themselves
with
a
curse
neither
to
eat
nor
to
drink
until
they
have
killed
him
and
they
are
now
ready
waiting
for
the
promise
from
you
22
So
the
military
commander
let
the
young
man
go
after
ordering
him
Do
not
tell
anyone
that
you
have
informed
me
of
this
23
And
he
summoned
two
of
the
army
officers
and
said
Get
200
soldiers
ready
to
march
clear
to
Caesarea
also
70
horsemen
and
200
spearmen
at
the
third
hour
of
the
night
24
Also
provide
horses
for
Paul
to
ride
to
take
him
safely
to
Felix
the
governor
25
And
he
wrote
a
letter
with
this
content
26
Claudius
Lysias
to
His
Excellency
Governor
Felix
Greetings
27
This
man
was
seized
by
the
Jews
and
was
about
to
be
killed
by
them
but
I
came
quickly
with
my
soldiers
and
rescued
him
because
I
learned
that
he
is
a
Roman
28
And
wanting
to
find
out
the
cause
for
which
they
were
accusing
him
I
brought
him
down
into
their
Sanhedrin
29
I
found
him
to
be
accused
about
questions
of
their
Law
but
not
charged
with
a
single
thing
deserving
of
death
or
prison
bonds
30
But
because
a
plot
against
the
man
has
been
made
known
to
me
I
am
at
once
sending
him
to
you
and
ordering
the
accusers
to
speak
against
him
before
you
31
So
these
soldiers
took
Paul
according
to
their
orders
and
brought
him
by
night
to
Antipatris
32
The
next
day
they
permitted
the
horsemen
to
go
on
with
him
but
they
returned
to
the
soldiers
quarters
33
The
horsemen
entered
Caesarea
and
delivered
the
letter
to
the
governor
and
also
presented
Paul
to
him
34
So
he
read
it
and
asked
what
province
he
was
from
and
learned
that
he
was
from
Cilicia
35
I
will
give
you
a
thorough
hearing

he
said
when
your
accusers
arrive
And
he
commanded
that
he
be
kept
under
guard
in
Herods
palace
1
Five
days
later
the
high
priest
Ananias
came
down
with
some
elders
and
a
public
speaker
named
Tertullus
and
they
presented
their
case
against
Paul
to
the
governor
2
When
he
was
called
Tertullus
started
accusing
him
saying
Seeing
that
we
enjoy
great
peace
through
you
and
that
through
your
forethought
reforms
are
taking
place
in
this
nation
3
at
all
times
and
also
in
all
places
we
acknowledge
this
Your
Excellency
Felix
with
the
greatest
thankfulness
4
But
that
I
may
not
detain
you
any
further
I
beg
you
to
hear
us
briefly
in
your
kindness
5
For
we
have
found
this
man
to
be
a
pest
stirring
up
seditions
among
all
the
Jews
throughout
the
inhabited
earth
and
he
is
a
spearhead
of
the
sect
of
the
Nazarenes
6
He
also
tried
to
profane
the
temple
so
we
seized
him
7
——
8
When
you
examine
him
yourself
you
will
find
out
about
all
these
things
of
which
we
are
accusing
him
9
With
that
the
Jews
also
joined
in
the
attack
asserting
that
these
things
were
true
10
When
the
governor
nodded
to
Paul
to
speak
he
answered
Knowing
well
that
this
nation
has
had
you
as
judge
for
many
years
I
readily
speak
in
my
own
defense
11
As
you
can
verify
for
yourself
it
has
not
been
more
than
12
days
since
I
went
up
to
worship
in
Jerusalem
12
and
they
found
me
neither
arguing
with
anyone
in
the
temple
nor
stirring
up
a
mob
either
in
the
synagogues
or
throughout
the
city
13
Nor
can
they
prove
to
you
the
things
they
are
accusing
me
of
right
now
14
But
I
do
admit
this
to
you
that
according
to
the
way
that
they
call
a
sect
in
this
manner
I
am
rendering
sacred
service
to
the
God
of
my
forefathers
as
I
believe
all
the
things
set
forth
in
the
Law
and
written
in
the
Prophets
15
And
I
have
hope
toward
God
which
hope
these
men
also
look
forward
to
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
resurrection
of
both
the
righteous
and
the
unrighteous
16
Because
of
this
I
always
strive
to
maintain
a
clear
conscience
before
God
and
men
17
Now
after
quite
a
number
of
years
I
arrived
to
bring
gifts
of
mercy
to
my
nation
and
to
make
offerings
18
While
I
was
caring
for
these
matters
they
found
me
ceremonially
cleansed
in
the
temple
but
not
with
a
crowd
or
causing
a
disturbance
But
there
were
some
Jews
from
the
province
of
Asia
19
who
ought
to
be
present
before
you
to
accuse
me
if
they
actually
have
anything
against
me
20
Or
let
the
men
here
say
for
themselves
what
wrong
they
found
as
I
stood
before
the
Sanhedrin
21
except
for
this
one
thing
that
I
cried
out
while
standing
among
them
Over
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
I
am
today
being
judged
before
you
22
However
Felix
knowing
quite
well
the
facts
concerning
this
Way
began
to
put
them
off
and
say
Whenever
Lysias
the
military
commander
comes
down
I
will
decide
these
matters
involving
you
23
And
he
gave
orders
to
the
army
officer
that
the
man
be
kept
under
arrest
but
given
some
freedom
and
that
his
people
be
allowed
to
attend
to
his
needs
24
Some
days
later
Felix
came
with
Drusilla
his
wife
who
was
Jewish
and
he
sent
for
Paul
and
listened
to
him
speak
about
the
belief
in
Christ
Jesus
25
But
as
Paul
talked
about
righteousness
and
self-control
and
the
judgment
to
come
Felix
became
frightened
and
answered
Go
away
for
now
but
when
I
have
an
opportunity
I
will
send
for
you
again
26
At
the
same
time
he
was
hoping
that
Paul
would
give
him
money
For
that
reason
he
sent
for
him
even
more
frequently
and
conversed
with
him
27
But
when
two
years
had
elapsed
Felix
was
succeeded
by
Porcius
Festus
and
because
Felix
desired
to
gain
favor
with
the
Jews
he
left
Paul
in
custody
1
Therefore
Festus
after
arriving
in
the
province
and
taking
charge
went
up
three
days
later
to
Jerusalem
from
Caesarea
2
And
the
chief
priests
and
the
principal
men
of
the
Jews
gave
him
information
against
Paul
So
they
began
to
beg
Festus
3
as
a
favor
to
send
for
Paul
to
come
to
Jerusalem
But
they
were
planning
to
ambush
Paul
and
kill
him
along
the
road
4
However
Festus
answered
that
Paul
was
to
be
kept
in
Caesarea
and
that
he
himself
was
about
to
go
back
there
shortly
5
So
let
those
who
are
in
power
among
you

he
said
come
down
with
me
and
accuse
him
if
indeed
the
man
has
done
something
wrong
6
So
when
he
had
spent
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
days
among
them
he
went
down
to
Caesarea
and
the
next
day
he
sat
down
on
the
judgment
seat
and
commanded
Paul
to
be
brought
in
7
When
he
came
in
the
Jews
who
had
come
down
from
Jerusalem
stood
around
him
bringing
against
him
many
serious
charges
that
they
were
unable
to
prove
8
But
Paul
said
in
defense
Neither
against
the
Law
of
the
Jews
nor
against
the
temple
nor
against
Caesar
have
I
committed
any
sin
9
Festus
desiring
to
gain
favor
with
the
Jews
said
in
reply
to
Paul
Do
you
wish
to
go
up
to
Jerusalem
and
be
judged
before
me
there
concerning
these
things
10
But
Paul
said
I
am
standing
before
the
judgment
seat
of
Caesar
where
I
ought
to
be
judged
I
have
done
no
wrong
to
the
Jews
of
which
you
are
also
becoming
well-aware
11
If
I
am
really
a
wrongdoer
and
have
committed
anything
deserving
of
death
I
do
not
beg
off
from
dying
but
if
there
is
no
substance
to
the
accusations
these
men
have
made
against
me
no
man
has
the
right
to
hand
me
over
to
them
as
a
favor
I
appeal
to
Caesar
12
Then
Festus
after
speaking
with
the
assembly
of
counselors
replied
To
Caesar
you
have
appealed
to
Caesar
you
will
go
13
After
some
days
had
passed
Agrippa
the
king
and
Bernice
arrived
in
Caesarea
for
a
courtesy
visit
to
Festus
14
Since
they
were
spending
a
number
of
days
there
Festus
presented
Pauls
case
to
the
king
saying
There
is
a
man
who
was
left
as
a
prisoner
by
Felix
15
and
when
I
was
in
Jerusalem
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
of
the
Jews
brought
information
about
him
asking
for
a
judgment
of
condemnation
against
him
16
But
I
replied
to
them
that
it
is
not
Roman
procedure
to
hand
any
man
over
as
a
favor
before
the
accused
man
meets
his
accusers
face-to-face
and
gets
a
chance
to
speak
in
his
defense
concerning
the
complaint
17
So
when
they
arrived
here
I
did
not
delay
but
the
next
day
I
sat
down
on
the
judgment
seat
and
commanded
the
man
to
be
brought
in
18
Taking
the
stand
the
accusers
did
not
charge
him
with
any
of
the
wicked
things
I
had
expected
concerning
him
19
They
simply
had
certain
disputes
with
him
concerning
their
own
worship
of
the
deity
and
concerning
a
man
named
Jesus
who
was
dead
but
who
Paul
kept
asserting
was
alive
20
Being
at
a
loss
as
to
how
to
handle
this
dispute
I
asked
if
he
would
like
to
go
to
Jerusalem
and
be
judged
there
concerning
these
matters
21
But
when
Paul
appealed
to
be
kept
in
custody
for
the
decision
by
the
August
One
I
commanded
him
to
be
held
until
I
should
send
him
on
to
Caesar
22
Agrippa
then
said
to
Festus
I
would
like
to
hear
the
man
myself
Tomorrow

he
said
you
will
hear
him
23
So
the
next
day
Agrippa
and
Bernice
came
with
much
pompous
show
and
entered
the
audience
chamber
together
with
military
commanders
as
well
as
the
prominent
men
in
the
city
and
when
Festus
gave
the
command
Paul
was
brought
in
24
And
Festus
said
King
Agrippa
and
all
you
who
are
present
with
us
you
see
this
man
about
whom
the
whole
Jewish
populace
have
petitioned
me
both
in
Jerusalem
and
here
shouting
that
he
ought
not
to
live
any
longer
25
But
I
perceived
that
he
had
done
nothing
deserving
of
death
So
when
this
man
himself
appealed
to
the
August
One
I
decided
to
send
him
26
But
I
have
nothing
certain
to
write
about
him
to
my
Lord
So
I
brought
him
before
all
of
you
and
especially
before
you
King
Agrippa
so
that
after
the
judicial
examination
has
taken
place
I
might
have
something
to
write
27
For
it
seems
unreasonable
to
me
to
send
a
prisoner
and
not
also
to
indicate
the
charges
against
him
1
Agrippa
said
to
Paul
You
are
permitted
to
speak
in
your
own
behalf
Then
Paul
stretched
out
his
hand
and
proceeded
to
say
in
his
defense
2
Concerning
all
the
things
of
which
I
am
accused
by
the
Jews
King
Agrippa
I
consider
myself
happy
that
it
is
before
you
I
am
to
make
my
defense
this
day
3
especially
because
you
are
an
expert
on
all
the
customs
as
well
as
the
controversies
among
the
Jews
Therefore
I
beg
you
to
hear
me
patiently
4
Indeed
the
manner
of
life
I
led
from
youth
up
among
my
people
and
in
Jerusalem
is
well-known
by
all
the
Jews
5
who
were
previously
acquainted
with
me
if
they
would
be
willing
to
testify
that
according
to
the
strictest
sect
of
our
form
of
worship
I
lived
as
a
Pharisee
6
But
now
for
the
hope
of
the
promise
that
was
made
by
God
to
our
forefathers
I
stand
on
trial
7
this
is
the
same
promise
our
12
tribes
are
hoping
to
see
fulfilled
by
intensely
rendering
him
sacred
service
night
and
day
Concerning
this
hope
I
am
accused
by
Jews
O
King
8
Why
is
it
considered
unbelievable
among
you
that
God
raises
up
the
dead
9
I
for
one
was
convinced
that
I
should
commit
many
acts
of
opposition
against
the
name
of
Jesus
the
Nazarene
10
This
is
exactly
what
I
did
in
Jerusalem
and
I
locked
up
many
of
the
holy
ones
in
prisons
for
I
had
received
authority
from
the
chief
priests
and
when
they
were
to
be
executed
I
cast
my
vote
against
them
11
By
punishing
them
often
in
all
the
synagogues
I
tried
to
force
them
to
recant
and
since
I
was
extremely
furious
with
them
I
went
so
far
as
to
persecute
them
even
in
outlying
cities
12
While
doing
this
as
I
was
traveling
to
Damascus
with
authority
and
a
commission
from
the
chief
priests
13
I
saw
at
midday
on
the
road
O
King
a
light
beyond
the
brilliance
of
the
sun
flash
from
heaven
around
me
and
around
those
traveling
with
me
14
And
when
we
had
all
fallen
to
the
ground
I
heard
a
voice
say
to
me
in
the
Hebrew
language
Saul
Saul
why
are
you
persecuting
me
To
keep
kicking
against
the
goads
makes
it
hard
for
you
15
But
I
said
Who
are
you
Lord
And
the
Lord
said
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are
persecuting
16
But
rise
and
stand
on
your
feet
This
is
why
I
have
appeared
to
you
to
choose
you
as
a
servant
and
a
witness
both
of
things
you
have
seen
and
things
I
will
make
you
see
respecting
me
17
And
I
will
rescue
you
from
this
people
and
from
the
nations
to
whom
I
am
sending
you
18
to
open
their
eyes
to
turn
them
from
darkness
to
light
and
from
the
authority
of
Satan
to
God
so
that
they
may
receive
forgiveness
of
sins
and
an
inheritance
among
those
sanctified
by
their
faith
in
me
19
Therefore
King
Agrippa
I
did
not
become
disobedient
to
the
heavenly
vision
20
but
to
those
in
Damascus
first
and
then
to
those
in
Jerusalem
and
over
all
the
country
of
Judea
and
also
to
the
nations
I
was
bringing
the
message
that
they
should
repent
and
turn
to
God
by
doing
works
that
befit
repentance
21
This
is
why
the
Jews
seized
me
in
the
temple
and
tried
to
kill
me
22
However
because
I
have
experienced
the
help
that
is
from
God
I
continue
to
this
day
bearing
witness
to
both
small
and
great
saying
nothing
except
what
the
Prophets
as
well
as
Moses
stated
was
going
to
take
place—
23
that
the
Christ
was
to
suffer
and
that
as
the
first
to
be
resurrected
from
the
dead
he
was
going
to
proclaim
light
both
to
this
people
and
to
the
nations
24
Now
as
Paul
was
saying
these
things
in
his
defense
Festus
said
in
a
loud
voice
You
are
going
out
of
your
mind
Paul
Great
learning
is
driving
you
out
of
your
mind
25
But
Paul
said
I
am
not
going
out
of
my
mind
Your
Excellency
Festus
but
I
am
speaking
words
of
truth
and
of
a
sound
mind
26
For
a
fact
the
king
to
whom
I
am
speaking
so
freely
well
knows
about
these
things
I
am
convinced
that
not
one
of
these
things
escapes
his
notice
for
none
of
this
has
been
done
in
a
corner
27
Do
you
King
Agrippa
believe
the
Prophets
I
know
that
you
believe
28
But
Agrippa
said
to
Paul
In
a
short
time
you
would
persuade
me
to
become
a
Christian
29
At
this
Paul
said
I
wish
to
God
that
whether
in
a
short
time
or
in
a
long
time
not
only
you
but
also
all
those
who
hear
me
today
would
become
men
such
as
I
am
with
the
exception
of
these
prison
bonds
30
Then
the
king
rose
and
so
did
the
governor
and
Bernice
and
the
men
seated
with
them
31
But
as
they
were
leaving
they
began
saying
to
one
another
This
man
is
doing
nothing
deserving
of
death
or
prison
bonds
32
Agrippa
then
said
to
Festus
This
man
could
have
been
released
if
he
had
not
appealed
to
Caesar
1
Now
as
it
was
decided
for
us
to
sail
away
to
Italy
they
handed
Paul
and
some
other
prisoners
over
to
an
army
officer
named
Julius
of
the
unit
of
Augustus
2
Going
aboard
a
ship
from
Adramyttium
that
was
about
to
sail
to
ports
along
the
coast
of
the
province
of
Asia
we
set
sail
Aristarchus
a
Macedonian
from
Thessalonica
was
with
us
3
The
next
day
we
landed
at
Sidon
and
Julius
treated
Paul
with
kindness
and
permitted
him
to
go
to
his
friends
and
enjoy
their
care
4
And
putting
out
to
sea
from
there
we
sailed
under
the
shelter
of
Cyprus
because
the
winds
were
against
us
5
Then
we
navigated
through
the
open
sea
along
Cilicia
and
Pamphylia
and
put
into
port
at
Myra
in
Lycia
6
There
the
army
officer
found
a
ship
from
Alexandria
that
was
sailing
for
Italy
and
he
made
us
board
it
7
Then
after
sailing
on
slowly
quite
a
number
of
days
we
came
to
Cnidus
with
difficulty
Because
the
wind
did
not
let
us
make
headway
we
sailed
under
the
shelter
of
Crete
off
Salmone
8
And
sailing
with
difficulty
along
the
coast
we
came
to
a
place
called
Fair
Havens
which
was
near
the
city
of
Lasea
9
A
considerable
time
had
passed
and
by
now
it
was
hazardous
to
navigate
because
even
the
fast
of
Atonement
Day
was
already
over
so
Paul
made
a
recommendation
10
to
them
Men
I
can
see
that
this
voyage
is
going
to
result
in
damage
and
great
loss
not
only
of
the
cargo
and
the
ship
but
also
of
our
lives
11
However
the
army
officer
listened
to
the
pilot
and
the
shipowner
rather
than
to
what
Paul
was
saying
12
Since
the
harbor
was
unsuitable
for
wintering
the
majority
advised
setting
sail
from
there
to
see
if
they
could
somehow
make
it
to
spend
the
winter
in
Phoenix
a
harbor
of
Crete
that
opens
toward
the
northeast
and
toward
the
southeast
13
When
the
south
wind
blew
softly
they
thought
they
had
achieved
their
purpose
and
they
lifted
anchor
and
began
sailing
along
Crete
close
to
the
shore
14
After
a
short
time
however
a
violent
wind
called
Euroaquilo
rushed
down
on
it
15
As
the
ship
was
violently
seized
and
was
not
able
to
keep
its
head
against
the
wind
we
gave
way
to
it
and
were
driven
along
16
Then
we
ran
under
the
shelter
of
a
small
island
called
Cauda
and
yet
we
were
hardly
able
to
get
the
skiff
at
the
stern
of
the
ship
under
control
17
But
after
hoisting
it
aboard
they
used
supports
to
undergird
the
ship
and
fearing
that
they
would
run
aground
on
the
Syrtis
they
lowered
the
gear
and
so
were
driven
along
18
Because
we
were
being
violently
tossed
by
the
storm
they
began
to
lighten
the
ship
the
following
day
19
And
on
the
third
day
they
threw
away
the
tackling
of
the
ship
with
their
own
hands
20
When
neither
sun
nor
stars
appeared
for
many
days
and
a
violent
storm
was
battering
us
all
hope
of
our
being
saved
finally
began
to
fade
21
After
they
had
gone
a
long
time
without
food
Paul
stood
up
in
their
midst
and
said
Men
you
certainly
should
have
taken
my
advice
and
not
have
put
out
to
sea
from
Crete
and
as
a
result
suffered
this
damage
and
loss
22
Still
I
now
urge
you
to
take
courage
for
not
one
of
you
will
be
lost
only
the
ship
will
23
This
night
an
angel
of
the
God
to
whom
I
belong
and
to
whom
I
render
sacred
service
stood
by
me
24
and
said
Have
no
fear
Paul
You
must
stand
before
Caesar
and
look
God
has
granted
to
you
all
those
sailing
with
you
25
So
take
courage
men
for
I
believe
God
that
it
will
be
exactly
as
I
was
told
26
However
we
must
be
cast
ashore
on
some
island
27
Now
when
the
14th
night
fell
and
we
were
being
tossed
about
on
the
Sea
of
Adria
at
midnight
the
sailors
began
to
suspect
that
they
were
getting
near
to
some
land
28
They
sounded
the
depth
and
found
it
20
fathoms
so
they
proceeded
a
short
distance
and
again
made
a
sounding
and
found
it
15
fathoms
29
And
fearing
that
we
might
run
aground
on
the
rocks
they
cast
out
four
anchors
from
the
stern
and
began
wishing
for
it
to
become
day
30
But
when
the
sailors
began
trying
to
escape
from
the
ship
and
were
lowering
the
skiff
into
the
sea
under
the
pretense
of
intending
to
let
down
anchors
from
the
bow
31
Paul
said
to
the
army
officer
and
the
soldiers
Unless
these
men
remain
in
the
ship
you
cannot
be
saved
32
Then
the
soldiers
cut
away
the
ropes
of
the
skiff
and
let
it
fall
off
33
Now
close
to
daybreak
Paul
encouraged
them
all
to
take
some
food
saying
Today
is
the
14th
day
you
have
been
waiting
anxiously
and
you
have
gone
without
taking
any
food
at
all
34
So
I
encourage
you
to
eat
some
food
this
is
in
the
interests
of
your
safety
for
not
a
hair
of
the
head
of
any
one
of
you
will
perish
35
After
he
said
this
he
took
bread
gave
thanks
to
God
before
them
all
broke
it
and
started
eating
36
So
they
all
took
courage
and
began
taking
some
food
themselves
37
In
all
we
were
276
persons
in
the
ship
38
When
they
had
eaten
enough
food
to
be
satisfied
they
lightened
the
ship
by
throwing
the
wheat
overboard
into
the
sea
39
When
daylight
came
they
could
not
recognize
the
land
but
they
saw
a
bay
with
a
beach
and
were
determined
to
beach
the
ship
there
if
they
could
40
So
they
cut
away
the
anchors
and
let
them
fall
into
the
sea
at
the
same
time
loosening
the
lashings
of
the
rudder
oars
and
after
hoisting
the
foresail
to
the
wind
they
made
for
the
beach
41
When
they
struck
a
shoal
washed
on
each
side
by
the
sea
they
ran
the
ship
aground
and
the
bow
got
stuck
and
stayed
immovable
but
the
stern
began
to
be
violently
broken
to
pieces
by
the
waves
42
At
this
the
soldiers
decided
to
kill
the
prisoners
so
that
no
one
might
swim
away
and
escape
43
But
the
army
officer
was
determined
to
bring
Paul
safely
through
and
prevented
them
from
carrying
out
their
plan
He
commanded
those
able
to
swim
to
jump
into
the
sea
and
make
it
to
land
first
44
and
the
rest
were
to
follow
some
on
planks
and
some
on
pieces
of
the
ship
So
all
were
brought
safely
to
land
1
After
we
made
it
to
safety
we
learned
that
the
island
was
called
Malta
2
And
the
foreign-speaking
people
showed
us
extraordinary
kindness
They
kindled
a
fire
and
received
all
of
us
kindly
because
of
the
rain
that
was
falling
and
because
of
the
cold
3
But
when
Paul
collected
a
bundle
of
sticks
and
laid
it
on
the
fire
a
viper
came
out
because
of
the
heat
and
fastened
itself
on
his
hand
4
When
the
foreign-speaking
people
caught
sight
of
the
venomous
creature
hanging
from
his
hand
they
began
saying
to
one
another
Surely
this
man
is
a
murderer
and
although
he
made
it
to
safety
from
the
sea
Justice
did
not
permit
him
to
keep
on
living
5
However
he
shook
the
creature
off
into
the
fire
and
suffered
no
harm
6
But
they
were
expecting
him
to
swell
up
or
suddenly
to
drop
dead
After
they
waited
for
a
long
time
and
saw
that
nothing
bad
happened
to
him
they
changed
their
mind
and
began
saying
he
was
a
god
7
Now
in
the
neighborhood
of
that
place
were
lands
belonging
to
the
principal
man
of
the
island
whose
name
was
Publius
and
he
welcomed
us
and
entertained
us
hospitably
for
three
days
8
It
so
happened
that
the
father
of
Publius
was
lying
in
bed
sick
with
fever
and
dysentery
and
Paul
went
in
to
him
and
prayed
laid
his
hands
on
him
and
healed
him
9
After
this
occurred
the
rest
of
the
people
on
the
island
who
were
sick
also
began
to
come
to
him
and
be
cured
10
They
also
honored
us
with
many
gifts
and
when
we
were
setting
sail
they
loaded
us
up
with
whatever
we
needed
11
Three
months
later
we
set
sail
in
a
ship
with
the
figurehead
Sons
of
Zeus
The
ship
was
from
Alexandria
and
had
wintered
in
the
island
12
Putting
into
port
at
Syracuse
we
remained
there
for
three
days
13
from
there
we
went
along
and
arrived
at
Rhegium
A
day
later
a
south
wind
sprang
up
and
we
made
it
into
Puteoli
on
the
second
day
14
Here
we
found
brothers
and
were
urged
to
remain
with
them
for
seven
days
and
so
we
went
toward
Rome
15
From
there
the
brothers
when
they
heard
the
news
about
us
came
as
far
as
the
Marketplace
of
Appius
and
Three
Taverns
to
meet
us
On
catching
sight
of
them
Paul
thanked
God
and
took
courage
16
When
finally
we
entered
Rome
Paul
was
permitted
to
stay
by
himself
with
the
soldier
guarding
him
17
However
three
days
later
he
called
together
the
principal
men
of
the
Jews
When
they
had
assembled
he
said
to
them
Men
brothers
although
I
had
done
nothing
contrary
to
the
people
or
the
customs
of
our
forefathers
I
was
handed
over
as
a
prisoner
from
Jerusalem
into
the
hands
of
the
Romans
18
And
after
making
an
examination
they
wanted
to
release
me
for
there
were
no
grounds
for
putting
me
to
death
19
But
when
the
Jews
objected
I
was
compelled
to
appeal
to
Caesar
but
not
because
I
had
any
accusation
to
make
against
my
nation
20
So
for
this
reason
I
asked
to
see
and
speak
to
you
for
it
is
because
of
the
hope
of
Israel
that
I
have
this
chain
around
me
21
They
said
to
him
We
have
not
received
letters
about
you
from
Judea
nor
have
any
of
the
brothers
who
came
from
there
reported
or
spoken
anything
bad
about
you
22
But
we
think
it
proper
to
hear
from
you
what
your
thoughts
are
for
truly
as
regards
this
sect
we
know
that
it
is
spoken
against
everywhere
23
They
now
arranged
for
a
day
to
meet
with
him
and
they
came
in
even
greater
numbers
to
him
in
his
lodging
place
And
from
morning
to
evening
he
explained
the
matter
to
them
by
bearing
thorough
witness
concerning
the
Kingdom
of
God
to
persuade
them
about
Jesus
from
both
the
Law
of
Moses
and
the
Prophets
24
Some
began
to
believe
the
things
he
said
others
would
not
believe
25
So
because
they
disagreed
with
one
another
they
began
to
leave
and
Paul
made
this
one
comment
The
holy
spirit
aptly
spoke
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
to
your
forefathers
26
saying
Go
to
this
people
and
say
You
will
indeed
hear
but
by
no
means
understand
and
you
will
indeed
look
but
by
no
means
see
27
For
the
heart
of
this
people
has
grown
unreceptive
and
with
their
ears
they
have
heard
without
response
and
they
have
shut
their
eyes
so
that
they
might
never
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
understand
with
their
heart
and
turn
back
and
I
heal
them
28
So
let
it
be
known
to
you
that
this
salvation
from
God
has
been
sent
out
to
the
nations
they
will
certainly
listen
to
it
29
——
30
So
he
remained
there
for
an
entire
two
years
in
his
own
rented
house
and
he
would
kindly
receive
all
those
who
came
to
him
31
preaching
the
Kingdom
of
God
to
them
and
teaching
about
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
with
the
greatest
freeness
of
speech
without
hindrance
1
Paul
a
slave
of
Christ
Jesus
and
called
to
be
an
apostle
set
apart
for
Gods
good
news
2
which
he
promised
beforehand
through
his
prophets
in
the
holy
Scriptures
3
concerning
his
Son
who
came
to
be
from
the
offspring
of
David
according
to
the
flesh
4
but
who
with
power
was
declared
Gods
Son
according
to
the
spirit
of
holiness
by
means
of
resurrection
from
the
dead—yes
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
5
Through
him
we
received
undeserved
kindness
and
an
apostleship
with
a
view
to
obedience
by
faith
among
all
the
nations
respecting
his
name
6
among
which
nations
you
also
have
been
called
to
belong
to
Jesus
Christ—
7
to
all
those
who
are
in
Rome
as
Gods
beloved
ones
called
to
be
holy
ones
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
8
First
of
all
I
give
thanks
to
my
God
through
Jesus
Christ
concerning
all
of
you
because
your
faith
is
talked
about
throughout
the
whole
world
9
For
God
to
whom
I
render
sacred
service
with
my
spirit
in
connection
with
the
good
news
about
his
Son
is
my
witness
of
how
without
ceasing
I
always
mention
you
in
my
prayers
10
begging
that
if
at
all
possible
I
may
now
at
last
succeed
in
coming
to
you
by
Gods
will
11
For
I
am
longing
to
see
you
that
I
may
impart
some
spiritual
gift
to
you
for
you
to
be
made
firm
12
or
rather
that
we
may
have
an
interchange
of
encouragement
by
one
anothers
faith
both
yours
and
mine
13
But
I
do
not
want
you
to
be
unaware
brothers
that
many
times
I
have
intended
to
come
to
you—but
I
have
been
prevented
until
now—in
order
that
I
might
acquire
some
fruitage
also
among
you
just
as
among
the
rest
of
the
nations
14
Both
to
Greeks
and
to
foreigners
both
to
wise
and
to
senseless
ones
I
am
a
debtor
15
so
I
am
eager
to
declare
the
good
news
also
to
you
there
in
Rome
16
For
I
am
not
ashamed
of
the
good
news
it
is
in
fact
Gods
power
for
salvation
to
everyone
having
faith
to
the
Jew
first
and
also
to
the
Greek
17
For
in
it
Gods
righteousness
is
being
revealed
by
faith
and
for
faith
just
as
it
is
written
But
the
righteous
one
will
live
by
reason
of
faith
18
For
Gods
wrath
is
being
revealed
from
heaven
against
all
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of
men
who
are
suppressing
the
truth
in
an
unrighteous
way
19
because
what
may
be
known
about
God
is
clearly
evident
among
them
for
God
made
it
clear
to
them
20
For
his
invisible
qualities
are
clearly
seen
from
the
worlds
creation
onward
because
they
are
perceived
by
the
things
made
even
his
eternal
power
and
Godship
so
that
they
are
inexcusable
21
For
although
they
knew
God
they
did
not
glorify
him
as
God
nor
did
they
thank
him
but
they
became
empty-headed
in
their
reasonings
and
their
senseless
hearts
became
darkened
22
Although
claiming
they
were
wise
they
became
foolish
23
and
turned
the
glory
of
the
incorruptible
God
into
something
like
the
image
of
corruptible
man
and
birds
and
four-footed
creatures
and
reptiles
24
Therefore
God
in
keeping
with
the
desires
of
their
hearts
gave
them
up
to
uncleanness
so
that
their
bodies
might
be
dishonored
among
them
25
They
exchanged
the
truth
of
God
for
the
lie
and
venerated
and
rendered
sacred
service
to
the
creation
rather
than
the
Creator
who
is
praised
forever
Amen
26
That
is
why
God
gave
them
over
to
uncontrolled
sexual
passion
for
their
females
changed
the
natural
use
of
themselves
into
one
contrary
to
nature
27
likewise
also
the
males
left
the
natural
use
of
the
female
and
became
violently
inflamed
in
their
lust
toward
one
another
males
with
males
working
what
is
obscene
and
receiving
in
themselves
the
full
penalty
which
was
due
for
their
error
28
Just
as
they
did
not
see
fit
to
acknowledge
God
God
gave
them
over
to
a
disapproved
mental
state
to
do
the
things
not
fitting
29
And
they
were
filled
with
all
unrighteousness
wickedness
greed
and
badness
being
full
of
envy
murder
strife
deceit
and
malice
being
whisperers
30
backbiters
haters
of
God
insolent
haughty
boastful
schemers
of
what
is
harmful
disobedient
to
parents
31
without
understanding
false
to
agreements
having
no
natural
affection
and
merciless
32
Although
these
know
full
well
the
righteous
decree
of
God—that
those
practicing
such
things
are
deserving
of
death—they
not
only
keep
on
doing
them
but
also
approve
of
those
practicing
them
1
Therefore
you
are
inexcusable
O
man
whoever
you
are
if
you
judge
for
when
you
judge
another
you
condemn
yourself
because
you
who
judge
practice
the
same
things
2
Now
we
know
that
Gods
judgment
is
in
harmony
with
truth
against
those
who
practice
such
things
3
But
do
you
suppose
O
man
that
while
you
judge
those
who
practice
such
things
and
yet
you
do
them
you
will
escape
the
judgment
of
God
4
Or
do
you
despise
the
riches
of
his
kindness
and
forbearance
and
patience
because
you
do
not
know
that
God
in
his
kindness
is
trying
to
lead
you
to
repentance
5
But
according
to
your
stubbornness
and
your
unrepentant
heart
you
are
storing
up
wrath
for
yourself
on
the
day
of
wrath
and
of
the
revealing
of
Gods
righteous
judgment
6
And
he
will
pay
back
to
each
one
according
to
his
works
7
everlasting
life
to
those
who
are
seeking
glory
and
honor
and
incorruptibleness
by
endurance
in
work
that
is
good
8
however
for
those
who
are
contentious
and
who
disobey
the
truth
but
obey
unrighteousness
there
will
be
wrath
and
anger
9
There
will
be
tribulation
and
distress
on
every
person
who
works
what
is
harmful
on
the
Jew
first
and
also
on
the
Greek
10
but
glory
and
honor
and
peace
for
everyone
who
works
what
is
good
for
the
Jew
first
and
also
for
the
Greek
11
For
there
is
no
partiality
with
God
12
For
all
those
who
sinned
without
law
will
also
perish
without
law
but
all
those
who
sinned
under
law
will
be
judged
by
law
13
For
the
hearers
of
law
are
not
the
ones
righteous
before
God
but
the
doers
of
law
will
be
declared
righteous
14
For
when
people
of
the
nations
who
do
not
have
law
do
by
nature
the
things
of
the
law
these
people
although
not
having
law
are
a
law
to
themselves
15
They
are
the
very
ones
who
demonstrate
the
matter
of
the
law
to
be
written
in
their
hearts
while
their
conscience
is
bearing
witness
with
them
and
by
their
own
thoughts
they
are
being
accused
or
even
excused
16
This
will
take
place
in
the
day
when
God
through
Christ
Jesus
judges
the
secret
things
of
mankind
according
to
the
good
news
I
declare
17
If
now
you
are
a
Jew
in
name
and
rely
on
law
and
take
pride
in
God
18
and
you
know
his
will
and
approve
of
things
that
are
excellent
because
you
are
instructed
out
of
the
Law
19
and
you
are
convinced
that
you
are
a
guide
of
the
blind
a
light
for
those
in
darkness
20
a
corrector
of
the
unreasonable
ones
a
teacher
of
young
children
and
having
the
framework
of
the
knowledge
and
of
the
truth
in
the
Law—
21
do
you
however
the
one
teaching
someone
else
not
teach
yourself
You
the
one
preaching
Do
not
steal

do
you
steal
22
You
the
one
saying
Do
not
commit
adultery

do
you
commit
adultery
You
the
one
abhorring
idols
do
you
rob
temples
23
You
who
take
pride
in
law
do
you
dishonor
God
by
your
transgressing
of
the
Law
24
For
the
name
of
God
is
being
blasphemed
among
the
nations
because
of
you

just
as
it
is
written
25
Circumcision
is
in
fact
of
benefit
only
if
you
practice
law
but
if
you
are
a
transgressor
of
law
your
circumcision
has
become
uncircumcision
26
If
therefore
an
uncircumcised
person
keeps
the
righteous
requirements
of
the
Law
his
uncircumcision
will
be
counted
as
circumcision
will
it
not
27
And
the
physically
uncircumcised
person
will
by
carrying
out
the
Law
judge
you
who
are
a
transgressor
of
law
despite
having
its
written
code
and
circumcision
28
For
he
is
not
a
Jew
who
is
one
on
the
outside
nor
is
circumcision
something
on
the
outside
on
the
flesh
29
But
he
is
a
Jew
who
is
one
on
the
inside
and
his
circumcision
is
that
of
the
heart
by
spirit
and
not
by
a
written
code
That
persons
praise
comes
from
God
not
from
people
1
What
then
is
the
advantage
of
the
Jew
or
what
is
the
benefit
of
circumcision
2
A
great
deal
in
every
way
First
of
all
that
they
were
entrusted
with
the
sacred
pronouncements
of
God
3
What
then
is
the
case
If
some
lacked
faith
will
their
lack
of
faith
invalidate
the
faithfulness
of
God
4
Certainly
not
But
let
God
be
found
true
even
if
every
man
be
found
a
liar
just
as
it
is
written
That
you
might
be
proved
righteous
in
your
words
and
might
win
when
you
are
being
judged
5
However
if
our
unrighteousness
highlights
Gods
righteousness
what
are
we
to
say
God
is
not
unjust
when
he
expresses
his
wrath
is
he
I
am
speaking
in
human
terms
6
By
no
means
How
otherwise
will
God
judge
the
world
7
But
if
by
my
lie
the
truth
of
God
has
been
made
more
prominent
to
his
glory
why
am
I
also
being
judged
as
a
sinner
8
And
why
not
say
just
as
some
men
falsely
claim
that
we
say
Let
us
do
bad
things
that
good
things
may
come
The
judgment
against
those
men
is
in
harmony
with
justice
9
What
then
Are
we
in
a
better
position
Not
at
all
For
above
we
have
made
the
charge
that
Jews
as
well
as
Greeks
are
all
under
sin
10
just
as
it
is
written
There
is
not
a
righteous
man
not
even
one
11
there
is
no
one
who
has
any
insight
there
is
no
one
who
searches
for
God
12
All
men
have
turned
aside
all
of
them
have
become
worthless
there
is
no
one
who
shows
kindness
not
so
much
as
one
13
Their
throat
is
an
open
grave
they
have
deceived
with
their
tongues
Venom
of
asps
is
behind
their
lips
14
And
their
mouth
is
full
of
cursing
and
bitterness
15
Their
feet
are
swift
to
shed
blood
16
Ruin
and
misery
are
in
their
ways
17
and
they
have
not
known
the
way
of
peace
18
There
is
no
fear
of
God
before
their
eyes
19
Now
we
know
that
all
the
things
the
Law
says
it
addresses
to
those
under
the
Law
so
that
every
mouth
may
be
silenced
and
all
the
world
may
become
accountable
to
God
for
punishment
20
Therefore
no
one
will
be
declared
righteous
before
him
by
works
of
law
for
by
law
comes
the
accurate
knowledge
of
sin
21
But
now
apart
from
law
Gods
righteousness
has
been
revealed
as
the
Law
and
the
Prophets
bear
witness
22
yes
Gods
righteousness
through
the
faith
in
Jesus
Christ
for
all
those
having
faith
For
there
is
no
distinction
23
For
all
have
sinned
and
fall
short
of
the
glory
of
God
24
and
it
is
as
a
free
gift
that
they
are
being
declared
righteous
by
his
undeserved
kindness
through
the
release
by
the
ransom
paid
by
Christ
Jesus
25
God
presented
him
as
an
offering
for
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
blood
This
was
to
demonstrate
his
own
righteousness
because
God
in
his
forbearance
was
forgiving
the
sins
that
occurred
in
the
past
26
This
was
to
demonstrate
his
own
righteousness
in
this
present
season
so
that
he
might
be
righteous
even
when
declaring
righteous
the
man
who
has
faith
in
Jesus
27
Where
then
is
the
boasting
There
is
no
place
for
it
Through
what
law
That
of
works
No
indeed
but
through
the
law
of
faith
28
For
we
consider
that
a
man
is
declared
righteous
by
faith
apart
from
works
of
law
29
Or
is
he
the
God
of
the
Jews
only
Is
he
not
also
the
God
of
people
of
the
nations
Yes
also
of
people
of
the
nations
30
Since
God
is
one
he
will
declare
circumcised
people
righteous
as
a
result
of
faith
and
uncircumcised
people
righteous
by
means
of
their
faith
31
Do
we
then
abolish
law
by
means
of
our
faith
Not
at
all
On
the
contrary
we
uphold
law
1
That
being
so
what
will
we
say
was
gained
by
Abraham
our
forefather
according
to
the
flesh
2
For
instance
if
Abraham
was
declared
righteous
as
a
result
of
works
he
would
have
reason
to
boast
but
not
with
God
3
For
what
does
the
scripture
say
Abraham
put
faith
in
Jehovah
and
it
was
counted
to
him
as
righteousness
4
Now
to
the
man
who
works
his
pay
is
not
counted
as
an
undeserved
kindness
but
as
something
owed
to
him
5
On
the
other
hand
to
the
man
who
does
not
work
but
puts
faith
in
the
One
who
declares
the
ungodly
one
righteous
his
faith
is
counted
as
righteousness
6
Just
as
David
also
speaks
of
the
happiness
of
the
man
to
whom
God
counts
righteousness
apart
from
works
7
Happy
are
those
whose
lawless
deeds
have
been
pardoned
and
whose
sins
have
been
covered
8
happy
is
the
man
whose
sin
Jehovah
will
by
no
means
take
into
account
9
Does
this
happiness
then
only
come
to
circumcised
people
or
also
to
uncircumcised
people
For
we
say
Abrahams
faith
was
counted
to
him
as
righteousness
10
Under
what
circumstances
then
was
it
counted
as
righteousness
When
he
was
circumcised
or
uncircumcised
He
was
not
yet
circumcised
but
was
uncircumcised
11
And
he
received
a
sign—namely
circumcision—as
a
seal
of
the
righteousness
by
the
faith
he
had
while
in
his
uncircumcised
state
so
that
he
might
be
the
father
of
all
those
having
faith
while
uncircumcised
in
order
for
righteousness
to
be
counted
to
them
12
and
so
that
he
might
be
a
father
to
circumcised
offspring
not
only
to
those
who
adhere
to
circumcision
but
also
to
those
who
walk
orderly
in
the
footsteps
of
the
faith
that
our
father
Abraham
had
while
in
the
uncircumcised
state
13
For
it
was
not
through
law
that
Abraham
or
his
offspring
had
the
promise
that
he
should
be
heir
of
a
world
but
it
was
through
righteousness
by
faith
14
For
if
those
who
adhere
to
law
are
heirs
faith
becomes
useless
and
the
promise
has
been
abolished
15
In
reality
the
Law
produces
wrath
but
where
there
is
no
law
neither
is
there
any
transgression
16
That
is
why
it
is
through
faith
so
that
it
might
be
according
to
undeserved
kindness
in
order
for
the
promise
to
be
sure
to
all
his
offspring
not
only
to
those
who
adhere
to
the
Law
but
also
to
those
who
adhere
to
the
faith
of
Abraham
who
is
the
father
of
us
all
17
This
is
just
as
it
is
written
I
have
appointed
you
a
father
of
many
nations
This
was
in
the
sight
of
God
in
whom
he
had
faith
who
makes
the
dead
alive
and
calls
the
things
that
are
not
as
though
they
are
18
Although
beyond
hope
yet
based
on
hope
he
had
faith
that
he
would
become
the
father
of
many
nations
according
to
what
had
been
said
So
your
offspring
will
be
19
And
although
he
did
not
grow
weak
in
faith
he
considered
his
own
body
now
as
good
as
dead
since
he
was
about
100
years
old
as
well
as
the
deadness
of
the
womb
of
Sarah
20
But
because
of
the
promise
of
God
he
did
not
waver
in
a
lack
of
faith
but
he
became
powerful
by
his
faith
giving
God
glory
21
and
being
fully
convinced
that
what
He
had
promised
He
was
also
able
to
do
22
Therefore
it
was
counted
to
him
as
righteousness
23
However
the
words
it
was
counted
to
him
were
not
written
for
his
sake
only
24
but
also
for
our
sake
to
whom
it
will
be
counted
because
we
believe
in
Him
who
raised
Jesus
our
Lord
up
from
the
dead
25
He
was
handed
over
for
the
sake
of
our
trespasses
and
was
raised
up
for
the
sake
of
declaring
us
righteous
1
Therefore
now
that
we
have
been
declared
righteous
as
a
result
of
faith
let
us
enjoy
peace
with
God
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
2
through
whom
we
also
have
obtained
access
by
faith
into
this
undeserved
kindness
in
which
we
now
stand
and
let
us
rejoice
based
on
hope
of
the
glory
of
God
3
Not
only
that
but
let
us
rejoice
while
in
tribulations
since
we
know
that
tribulation
produces
endurance
4
endurance
in
turn
an
approved
condition
the
approved
condition
in
turn
hope
5
and
the
hope
does
not
lead
to
disappointment
because
the
love
of
God
has
been
poured
out
into
our
hearts
through
the
holy
spirit
which
was
given
to
us
6
For
indeed
while
we
were
still
weak
Christ
died
for
ungodly
men
at
the
appointed
time
7
For
hardly
would
anyone
die
for
a
righteous
man
though
perhaps
for
a
good
man
someone
may
dare
to
die
8
But
God
recommends
his
own
love
to
us
in
that
while
we
were
yet
sinners
Christ
died
for
us
9
Much
more
then
since
we
have
now
been
declared
righteous
by
his
blood
will
we
be
saved
through
him
from
wrath
10
For
if
when
we
were
enemies
we
became
reconciled
to
God
through
the
death
of
his
Son
how
much
more
we
will
be
saved
by
his
life
now
that
we
have
become
reconciled
11
Not
only
that
but
we
are
also
rejoicing
in
God
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
we
have
now
received
the
reconciliation
12
That
is
why
just
as
through
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
world
and
death
through
sin
and
so
death
spread
to
all
men
because
they
had
all
sinned—
13
For
sin
was
in
the
world
before
the
Law
but
sin
is
not
charged
against
anyone
when
there
is
no
law
14
Nevertheless
death
ruled
as
king
from
Adam
down
to
Moses
even
over
those
who
had
not
sinned
in
the
same
way
that
Adam
transgressed
who
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
one
who
was
to
come
15
But
the
gift
is
not
like
the
trespass
For
if
by
one
mans
trespass
many
died
how
much
more
did
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
and
his
free
gift
by
the
undeserved
kindness
of
the
one
man
Jesus
Christ
abound
to
many
16
Also
it
is
not
the
same
with
the
free
gift
as
with
the
way
things
worked
through
the
one
man
who
sinned
For
the
judgment
after
one
trespass
was
condemnation
but
the
gift
after
many
trespasses
was
a
declaration
of
righteousness
17
For
if
by
the
trespass
of
the
one
man
death
ruled
as
king
through
that
one
how
much
more
will
those
who
receive
the
abundance
of
the
undeserved
kindness
and
of
the
free
gift
of
righteousness
rule
as
kings
in
life
through
the
one
person
Jesus
Christ
18
So
then
as
through
one
trespass
the
result
to
men
of
all
sorts
was
condemnation
so
too
through
one
act
of
justification
the
result
to
men
of
all
sorts
is
their
being
declared
righteous
for
life
19
For
just
as
through
the
disobedience
of
the
one
man
many
were
made
sinners
so
also
through
the
obedience
of
the
one
person
many
will
be
made
righteous
20
Now
the
Law
came
on
the
scene
so
that
trespassing
might
increase
But
where
sin
abounded
undeserved
kindness
abounded
still
more
21
To
what
end
So
that
just
as
sin
ruled
as
king
with
death
so
also
undeserved
kindness
might
rule
as
king
through
righteousness
leading
to
everlasting
life
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
1
What
are
we
to
say
then
Should
we
continue
in
sin
so
that
undeserved
kindness
may
increase
2
Certainly
not
Seeing
that
we
died
with
reference
to
sin
how
can
we
keep
living
any
longer
in
it
3
Or
do
you
not
know
that
all
of
us
who
were
baptized
into
Christ
Jesus
were
baptized
into
his
death
4
So
we
were
buried
with
him
through
our
baptism
into
his
death
in
order
that
just
as
Christ
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
through
the
glory
of
the
Father
so
we
also
should
walk
in
a
newness
of
life
5
If
we
have
become
united
with
him
in
the
likeness
of
his
death
we
will
certainly
also
be
united
with
him
in
the
likeness
of
his
resurrection
6
For
we
know
that
our
old
personality
was
nailed
to
the
stake
along
with
him
in
order
for
our
sinful
body
to
be
made
powerless
so
that
we
should
no
longer
go
on
being
slaves
to
sin
7
For
the
one
who
has
died
has
been
acquitted
from
his
sin
8
Moreover
if
we
have
died
with
Christ
we
believe
that
we
will
also
live
with
him
9
For
we
know
that
Christ
now
that
he
has
been
raised
up
from
the
dead
dies
no
more
death
is
no
longer
master
over
him
10
For
the
death
that
he
died
he
died
with
reference
to
sin
once
for
all
time
but
the
life
that
he
lives
he
lives
with
reference
to
God
11
Likewise
you
consider
yourselves
to
be
dead
with
reference
to
sin
but
living
with
reference
to
God
by
Christ
Jesus
12
Therefore
do
not
let
sin
continue
to
rule
as
king
in
your
mortal
bodies
so
that
you
should
obey
their
desires
13
Neither
go
on
presenting
your
bodies
to
sin
as
weapons
of
unrighteousness
but
present
yourselves
to
God
as
those
alive
from
the
dead
also
your
bodies
to
God
as
weapons
of
righteousness
14
For
sin
must
not
be
master
over
you
seeing
that
you
are
not
under
law
but
under
undeserved
kindness
15
What
follows
Are
we
to
commit
a
sin
because
we
are
not
under
law
but
under
undeserved
kindness
Certainly
not
16
Do
you
not
know
that
if
you
present
yourselves
to
anyone
as
obedient
slaves
you
are
slaves
of
the
one
you
obey
either
of
sin
leading
to
death
or
of
obedience
leading
to
righteousness
17
But
thanks
to
God
that
although
you
were
once
the
slaves
of
sin
you
became
obedient
from
the
heart
to
that
pattern
of
teaching
to
which
you
were
handed
over
18
Yes
since
you
were
set
free
from
sin
you
became
slaves
to
righteousness
19
I
am
speaking
in
human
terms
because
of
the
weakness
of
your
flesh
for
just
as
you
presented
your
members
as
slaves
to
uncleanness
and
lawlessness
leading
to
lawlessness
so
now
present
your
members
as
slaves
to
righteousness
leading
to
holiness
20
For
when
you
were
slaves
of
sin
you
were
free
as
to
righteousness
21
What
then
was
the
fruit
that
you
used
to
produce
at
that
time
Things
of
which
you
are
now
ashamed
For
the
end
of
those
things
is
death
22
However
now
that
you
were
set
free
from
sin
and
became
slaves
to
God
you
are
producing
your
fruit
in
the
way
of
holiness
and
the
end
is
everlasting
life
23
For
the
wages
sin
pays
is
death
but
the
gift
God
gives
is
everlasting
life
by
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
1
Can
it
be
that
you
do
not
know
brothers
for
I
am
speaking
to
those
who
know
law
that
the
Law
is
master
over
a
man
as
long
as
he
lives
2
For
instance
a
married
woman
is
bound
by
law
to
her
husband
while
he
is
alive
but
if
her
husband
dies
she
is
released
from
the
law
of
her
husband
3
So
then
while
her
husband
is
living
she
would
be
called
an
adulteress
if
she
became
another
mans
But
if
her
husband
dies
she
is
free
from
his
law
so
that
she
is
not
an
adulteress
if
she
becomes
another
mans
4
So
my
brothers
you
also
were
made
dead
to
the
Law
through
the
body
of
the
Christ
that
you
might
become
anothers
the
one
who
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
so
that
we
should
bear
fruit
to
God
5
For
when
we
were
living
according
to
the
flesh
the
sinful
passions
that
were
awakened
by
the
Law
were
at
work
in
our
bodies
to
produce
fruit
for
death
6
But
now
we
have
been
released
from
the
Law
because
we
have
died
to
that
which
restrained
us
in
order
that
we
might
be
slaves
in
a
new
sense
by
the
spirit
and
not
in
the
old
sense
by
the
written
code
7
What
then
are
we
to
say
Is
the
Law
sin
Certainly
not
Really
I
would
not
have
come
to
know
sin
had
it
not
been
for
the
Law
For
example
I
would
not
have
known
covetousness
if
the
Law
had
not
said
You
must
not
covet
8
But
sin
finding
the
opportunity
afforded
by
the
commandment
worked
out
in
me
covetousness
of
every
sort
for
apart
from
law
sin
was
dead
9
In
fact
I
was
once
alive
apart
from
law
But
when
the
commandment
arrived
sin
came
to
life
again
but
I
died
10
And
the
commandment
that
was
to
lead
to
life
this
I
found
led
to
death
11
For
sin
finding
the
opportunity
afforded
by
the
commandment
seduced
me
and
killed
me
through
it
12
So
the
Law
in
itself
is
holy
and
the
commandment
is
holy
and
righteous
and
good
13
Therefore
did
what
is
good
result
in
my
death
Certainly
not
But
sin
did
that
it
might
be
shown
to
be
sin
working
out
death
in
me
through
what
is
good
so
that
through
the
commandment
sin
might
become
far
more
sinful
14
For
we
know
that
the
Law
is
spiritual
but
I
am
fleshly
sold
under
sin
15
For
I
do
not
understand
what
I
am
doing
For
I
do
not
practice
what
I
wish
but
I
do
what
I
hate
16
However
if
I
do
what
I
do
not
wish
I
agree
that
the
Law
is
fine
17
But
now
I
am
no
longer
the
one
doing
it
but
it
is
the
sin
that
resides
in
me
18
For
I
know
that
in
me
that
is
in
my
flesh
there
dwells
nothing
good
for
I
have
the
desire
to
do
what
is
fine
but
not
the
ability
to
carry
it
out
19
For
I
do
not
do
the
good
that
I
wish
but
the
bad
that
I
do
not
wish
is
what
I
practice
20
If
then
I
do
what
I
do
not
wish
I
am
no
longer
the
one
carrying
it
out
but
it
is
the
sin
dwelling
in
me
21
I
find
then
this
law
in
my
case
When
I
wish
to
do
what
is
right
what
is
bad
is
present
with
me
22
I
really
delight
in
the
law
of
God
according
to
the
man
I
am
within
23
but
I
see
in
my
body
another
law
warring
against
the
law
of
my
mind
and
leading
me
captive
to
sins
law
that
is
in
my
body
24
Miserable
man
that
I
am
Who
will
rescue
me
from
the
body
undergoing
this
death
25
Thanks
to
God
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
So
then
with
my
mind
I
myself
am
a
slave
to
Gods
law
but
with
my
flesh
to
sins
law
1
Therefore
those
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
have
no
condemnation
2
For
the
law
of
the
spirit
that
gives
life
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
has
set
you
free
from
the
law
of
sin
and
of
death
3
What
the
Law
was
incapable
of
doing
because
it
was
weak
through
the
flesh
God
did
by
sending
his
own
Son
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
flesh
and
concerning
sin
condemning
sin
in
the
flesh
4
so
that
the
righteous
requirement
of
the
Law
might
be
fulfilled
in
us
who
walk
not
according
to
the
flesh
but
according
to
the
spirit
5
For
those
who
live
according
to
the
flesh
set
their
minds
on
the
things
of
the
flesh
but
those
who
live
according
to
the
spirit
on
the
things
of
the
spirit
6
For
setting
the
mind
on
the
flesh
means
death
but
setting
the
mind
on
the
spirit
means
life
and
peace
7
because
setting
the
mind
on
the
flesh
means
enmity
with
God
for
it
is
not
in
subjection
to
the
law
of
God
nor
in
fact
can
it
be
8
So
those
who
are
in
harmony
with
the
flesh
cannot
please
God
9
However
you
are
in
harmony
not
with
the
flesh
but
with
the
spirit
if
Gods
spirit
truly
dwells
in
you
But
if
anyone
does
not
have
Christs
spirit
this
person
does
not
belong
to
him
10
But
if
Christ
is
in
union
with
you
the
body
is
dead
because
of
sin
but
the
spirit
is
life
because
of
righteousness
11
If
now
the
spirit
of
him
who
raised
up
Jesus
from
the
dead
dwells
in
you
the
one
who
raised
up
Christ
Jesus
from
the
dead
will
also
make
your
mortal
bodies
alive
through
his
spirit
that
resides
in
you
12
So
then
brothers
we
are
under
obligation
not
to
the
flesh
to
live
according
to
the
flesh
13
for
if
you
live
according
to
the
flesh
you
are
sure
to
die
but
if
you
put
the
practices
of
the
body
to
death
by
the
spirit
you
will
live
14
For
all
who
are
led
by
Gods
spirit
are
indeed
Gods
sons
15
For
you
did
not
receive
a
spirit
of
slavery
causing
fear
again
but
you
received
a
spirit
of
adoption
as
sons
by
which
spirit
we
cry
out
Abba
Father
16
The
spirit
itself
bears
witness
with
our
spirit
that
we
are
Gods
children
17
If
then
we
are
children
we
are
also
heirs—heirs
indeed
of
God
but
joint
heirs
with
Christ—provided
we
suffer
together
so
that
we
may
also
be
glorified
together
18
For
I
consider
that
the
sufferings
of
the
present
time
do
not
amount
to
anything
in
comparison
with
the
glory
that
is
going
to
be
revealed
in
us
19
For
the
creation
is
waiting
with
eager
expectation
for
the
revealing
of
the
sons
of
God
20
For
the
creation
was
subjected
to
futility
not
by
its
own
will
but
through
the
one
who
subjected
it
on
the
basis
of
hope
21
that
the
creation
itself
will
also
be
set
free
from
enslavement
to
corruption
and
have
the
glorious
freedom
of
the
children
of
God
22
For
we
know
that
all
creation
keeps
on
groaning
together
and
being
in
pain
together
until
now
23
Not
only
that
but
we
ourselves
also
who
have
the
firstfruits
namely
the
spirit
yes
we
ourselves
groan
within
ourselves
while
we
are
earnestly
waiting
for
adoption
as
sons
the
release
from
our
bodies
by
ransom
24
For
we
were
saved
in
this
hope
but
hope
that
is
seen
is
not
hope
for
when
a
man
sees
a
thing
does
he
hope
for
it
25
But
if
we
hope
for
what
we
do
not
see
we
keep
eagerly
waiting
for
it
with
endurance
26
In
like
manner
the
spirit
also
joins
in
with
help
for
our
weakness
for
the
problem
is
that
we
do
not
know
what
we
should
pray
for
as
we
need
to
but
the
spirit
itself
pleads
for
us
with
unuttered
groanings
27
But
the
one
who
searches
the
hearts
knows
what
the
meaning
of
the
spirit
is
because
it
is
pleading
in
harmony
with
God
for
the
holy
ones
28
We
know
that
God
makes
all
his
works
cooperate
together
for
the
good
of
those
who
love
God
those
who
are
the
ones
called
according
to
his
purpose
29
because
those
whom
he
gave
his
first
recognition
he
also
foreordained
to
be
patterned
after
the
image
of
his
Son
so
that
he
might
be
the
firstborn
among
many
brothers
30
Moreover
those
whom
he
foreordained
are
the
ones
he
also
called
and
those
whom
he
called
are
the
ones
he
also
declared
to
be
righteous
Finally
those
whom
he
declared
righteous
are
the
ones
he
also
glorified
31
What
then
are
we
to
say
about
these
things
If
God
is
for
us
who
will
be
against
us
32
Since
he
did
not
even
spare
his
own
Son
but
handed
him
over
for
us
all
will
he
not
also
along
with
him
kindly
give
us
all
other
things
33
Who
will
file
accusation
against
Gods
chosen
ones
God
is
the
One
who
declares
them
righteous
34
Who
will
condemn
them
Christ
Jesus
is
the
one
who
died
yes
more
than
that
the
one
who
was
raised
up
who
is
at
the
right
hand
of
God
and
who
also
pleads
for
us
35
Who
will
separate
us
from
the
love
of
the
Christ
Will
tribulation
or
distress
or
persecution
or
hunger
or
nakedness
or
danger
or
sword
36
Just
as
it
is
written
For
your
sake
we
are
being
put
to
death
all
day
long
we
have
been
accounted
as
sheep
for
slaughtering
37
On
the
contrary
in
all
these
things
we
are
coming
off
completely
victorious
through
the
one
who
loved
us
38
For
I
am
convinced
that
neither
death
nor
life
nor
angels
nor
governments
nor
things
now
here
nor
things
to
come
nor
powers
39
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
any
other
creation
will
be
able
to
separate
us
from
Gods
love
that
is
in
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
1
I
am
telling
the
truth
in
Christ
I
am
not
lying
as
my
conscience
bears
witness
with
me
in
holy
spirit
2
that
I
have
great
grief
and
unceasing
pain
in
my
heart
3
For
I
could
wish
that
I
myself
were
separated
from
the
Christ
as
the
cursed
one
for
the
sake
of
my
brothers
my
relatives
according
to
the
flesh
4
who
are
Israelites
To
them
belong
the
adoption
as
sons
and
the
glory
and
the
covenants
and
the
giving
of
the
Law
and
the
sacred
service
and
the
promises
5
To
them
the
forefathers
belong
and
from
them
the
Christ
descended
according
to
the
flesh
God
who
is
over
all
be
praised
forever
Amen
6
However
it
is
not
as
though
the
word
of
God
has
failed
For
not
all
who
descend
from
Israel
are
really
Israel
7
Neither
are
they
all
children
because
they
are
Abrahams
offspring
rather
What
will
be
called
your
offspring
will
be
through
Isaac
8
That
is
the
children
in
the
flesh
are
not
really
the
children
of
God
but
the
children
by
the
promise
are
counted
as
the
offspring
9
For
the
word
of
promise
was
as
follows
At
this
time
I
will
come
and
Sarah
will
have
a
son
10
Not
only
then
but
also
when
Rebekah
conceived
twins
from
the
one
man
Isaac
our
forefather
11
for
when
they
had
not
yet
been
born
and
had
not
practiced
anything
good
or
bad
so
that
Gods
purpose
respecting
the
choosing
might
continue
dependent
not
on
works
but
on
the
One
who
calls
12
it
was
said
to
her
The
older
will
be
the
slave
of
the
younger
13
Just
as
it
is
written
I
loved
Jacob
but
Esau
I
hated
14
What
are
we
to
say
then
Is
there
injustice
with
God
Certainly
not
15
For
he
says
to
Moses
I
will
show
mercy
to
whomever
I
will
show
mercy
and
I
will
show
compassion
to
whomever
I
will
show
compassion
16
So
then
it
depends
not
on
a
persons
desire
or
on
his
effort
but
on
God
who
has
mercy
17
For
the
scripture
says
to
Pharaoh
For
this
very
reason
I
have
let
you
remain
to
show
my
power
in
connection
with
you
and
to
have
my
name
declared
in
all
the
earth
18
So
then
he
has
mercy
on
whomever
he
wishes
but
he
lets
whomever
he
wishes
become
obstinate
19
You
will
therefore
say
to
me
Why
does
he
still
find
fault
For
who
has
withstood
his
will
20
But
who
are
you
O
man
to
be
answering
back
to
God
Does
the
thing
molded
say
to
its
molder
Why
did
you
make
me
this
way
21
What
Does
not
the
potter
have
authority
over
the
clay
to
make
from
the
same
lump
one
vessel
for
an
honorable
use
another
for
a
dishonorable
use
22
What
then
if
God
had
the
will
to
demonstrate
his
wrath
and
to
make
his
power
known
and
he
tolerated
with
much
patience
vessels
of
wrath
made
fit
for
destruction
23
And
if
this
was
done
to
make
known
the
riches
of
his
glory
on
vessels
of
mercy
which
he
prepared
beforehand
for
glory
24
namely
us
whom
he
called
not
only
from
among
Jews
but
also
from
among
nations
what
of
it
25
It
is
as
he
says
also
in
Hosea
Those
not
my
people
I
will
call
my
people

and
her
who
was
not
loved
beloved
26
and
in
the
place
where
it
was
said
to
them
You
are
not
my
people

there
they
will
be
called
sons
of
the
living
God
27
Moreover
Isaiah
cries
out
concerning
Israel
Although
the
number
of
the
sons
of
Israel
may
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
only
the
remnant
will
be
saved
28
For
Jehovah
will
make
an
accounting
on
the
earth
concluding
it
and
cutting
it
short
29
Also
just
as
Isaiah
foretold
Unless
Jehovah
of
armies
had
left
an
offspring
to
us
we
should
have
become
just
like
Sodom
and
we
should
have
resembled
Gomorrah
30
What
are
we
to
say
then
That
people
of
the
nations
although
not
pursuing
righteousness
attained
righteousness
the
righteousness
that
results
from
faith
31
but
Israel
although
pursuing
a
law
of
righteousness
did
not
attain
to
that
law
32
For
what
reason
Because
they
pursued
it
not
by
faith
but
as
by
works
They
stumbled
over
the
stone
of
stumbling
33
as
it
is
written
Look
I
am
laying
in
Zion
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
a
rock
of
offense
but
the
one
who
rests
his
faith
on
it
will
not
be
disappointed

Brothers
the
goodwill
of
my
heart
and
my
supplication
to
God
for
them
are
indeed
for
their
salvation
2
For
I
bear
them
witness
that
they
have
a
zeal
for
God
but
not
according
to
accurate
knowledge
3
For
because
of
not
knowing
the
righteousness
of
God
but
seeking
to
establish
their
own
they
did
not
subject
themselves
to
the
righteousness
of
God
4
For
Christ
is
the
end
of
the
Law
so
that
everyone
exercising
faith
may
have
righteousness
5
For
Moses
writes
about
the
righteousness
that
is
by
the
Law
The
man
who
does
these
things
will
live
by
means
of
them
6
But
the
righteousness
resulting
from
faith
says
Do
not
say
in
your
heart
Who
will
ascend
into
heaven
that
is
to
bring
Christ
down
7
or
Who
will
descend
into
the
abyss
that
is
to
bring
Christ
up
from
the
dead
8
But
what
does
it
say
The
word
is
near
you
in
your
own
mouth
and
in
your
own
heart
that
is
the
word
of
faith
which
we
are
preaching
9
For
if
you
publicly
declare
with
your
mouth
that
Jesus
is
Lord
and
exercise
faith
in
your
heart
that
God
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
you
will
be
saved
10
For
with
the
heart
one
exercises
faith
for
righteousness
but
with
the
mouth
one
makes
public
declaration
for
salvation
11
For
the
scripture
says
No
one
who
rests
his
faith
on
him
will
be
disappointed
12
For
there
is
no
distinction
between
Jew
and
Greek
There
is
the
same
Lord
over
all
who
is
rich
toward
all
those
calling
on
him
13
For
everyone
who
calls
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
will
be
saved
14
However
how
will
they
call
on
him
if
they
have
not
put
faith
in
him
How
in
turn
will
they
put
faith
in
him
about
whom
they
have
not
heard
How
in
turn
will
they
hear
without
someone
to
preach
15
How
in
turn
will
they
preach
unless
they
have
been
sent
out
Just
as
it
is
written
How
beautiful
are
the
feet
of
those
who
declare
good
news
of
good
things
16
Nevertheless
they
did
not
all
obey
the
good
news
For
Isaiah
says
Jehovah
who
has
put
faith
in
the
thing
heard
from
us
17
So
faith
follows
the
thing
heard
In
turn
what
is
heard
is
through
the
word
about
Christ
18
But
I
ask
They
did
not
fail
to
hear
did
they
Why
in
fact
into
all
the
earth
their
sound
went
out
and
to
the
ends
of
the
inhabited
earth
their
message
19
But
I
ask
Israel
did
not
fail
to
know
did
they
First
Moses
says
I
will
incite
you
to
jealousy
through
that
which
is
not
a
nation
I
will
incite
you
to
violent
anger
through
a
foolish
nation
20
But
Isaiah
becomes
very
bold
and
says
I
was
found
by
those
who
were
not
seeking
me
I
became
known
to
those
who
were
not
asking
for
me
21
But
he
says
regarding
Israel
All
day
long
I
have
spread
out
my
hands
toward
a
disobedient
and
obstinate
people
1
I
ask
then
God
did
not
reject
his
people
did
he
By
no
means
For
I
too
am
an
Israelite
of
the
offspring
of
Abraham
from
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
2
God
did
not
reject
his
people
whom
he
first
recognized
Do
you
not
know
what
the
scripture
says
in
connection
with
Elijah
as
he
pleads
with
God
against
Israel
3
Jehovah
they
have
killed
your
prophets
they
have
dug
up
your
altars
and
I
alone
am
left
and
now
they
are
trying
to
take
my
life
4
Yet
what
does
the
divine
pronouncement
say
to
him
I
have
left
for
myself
7000
men
who
have
not
bent
the
knee
to
Baal
5
So
in
the
same
way
at
the
present
time
also
there
is
a
remnant
according
to
a
choosing
through
undeserved
kindness
6
Now
if
it
is
by
undeserved
kindness
it
is
no
longer
through
works
otherwise
the
undeserved
kindness
would
no
longer
be
undeserved
kindness
7
What
then
The
very
thing
Israel
is
earnestly
seeking
he
did
not
obtain
but
the
ones
chosen
obtained
it
The
rest
had
their
senses
dulled
8
just
as
it
is
written
God
has
given
them
a
spirit
of
deep
sleep
eyes
that
do
not
see
and
ears
that
do
not
hear
down
to
this
very
day
9
Also
David
says
Let
their
table
become
a
snare
and
a
trap
and
a
stumbling
block
and
a
retribution
for
them
10
Let
their
eyes
become
darkened
so
that
they
cannot
see
and
always
make
them
bend
their
backs
11
So
I
ask
They
did
not
stumble
and
fall
completely
did
they
Certainly
not
But
by
their
false
step
there
is
salvation
to
people
of
the
nations
to
incite
them
to
jealousy
12
Now
if
their
false
step
means
riches
to
the
world
and
their
decrease
means
riches
to
people
of
the
nations
how
much
more
will
their
full
number
mean
13
Now
I
speak
to
you
who
are
people
of
the
nations
Seeing
that
I
am
an
apostle
to
the
nations
I
glorify
my
ministry
14
to
see
if
I
may
in
some
way
incite
my
own
people
to
jealousy
and
save
some
from
among
them
15
For
if
their
being
cast
away
means
reconciliation
for
the
world
what
will
the
acceptance
of
them
mean
but
life
from
the
dead
16
Further
if
the
part
of
the
dough
taken
as
firstfruits
is
holy
the
entire
batch
is
also
holy
and
if
the
root
is
holy
the
branches
are
also
17
However
if
some
of
the
branches
were
broken
off
and
you
although
being
a
wild
olive
were
grafted
in
among
them
and
became
a
sharer
of
the
richness
of
the
olives
root
18
do
not
be
arrogant
toward
the
branches
If
though
you
are
arrogant
toward
them
remember
that
it
is
not
you
who
bears
the
root
but
the
root
bears
you
19
You
will
say
then
Branches
were
broken
off
so
that
I
might
be
grafted
in
20
That
is
true
For
their
lack
of
faith
they
were
broken
off
but
you
are
standing
by
faith
Do
not
be
haughty
but
be
in
fear
21
For
if
God
did
not
spare
the
natural
branches
neither
will
he
spare
you
22
Consider
therefore
Gods
kindness
and
severity
There
is
severity
toward
those
who
fell
but
toward
you
there
is
Gods
kindness
provided
you
remain
in
his
kindness
otherwise
you
too
will
be
lopped
off
23
And
they
also
if
they
do
not
remain
in
their
lack
of
faith
will
be
grafted
in
for
God
is
able
to
graft
them
back
in
24
For
if
you
were
cut
out
of
the
olive
tree
that
is
wild
by
nature
and
were
grafted
contrary
to
nature
into
the
garden
olive
tree
how
much
more
will
these
who
are
natural
branches
be
grafted
back
into
their
own
olive
tree
25
For
I
do
not
want
you
to
be
unaware
of
this
sacred
secret
brothers
so
that
you
do
not
become
wise
in
your
own
eyes
A
partial
dulling
of
senses
has
come
upon
Israel
until
the
full
number
of
people
of
the
nations
has
come
in
26
and
in
this
manner
all
Israel
will
be
saved
Just
as
it
is
written
The
deliverer
will
come
out
of
Zion
and
turn
away
ungodly
practices
from
Jacob
27
And
this
is
my
covenant
with
them
when
I
take
their
sins
away
28
True
with
respect
to
the
good
news
they
are
enemies
for
your
sakes
but
with
respect
to
Gods
choosing
they
are
beloved
for
the
sake
of
their
forefathers
29
For
the
gifts
and
the
calling
of
God
are
not
things
he
will
regret
30
For
just
as
you
were
once
disobedient
to
God
but
have
now
been
shown
mercy
because
of
their
disobedience
31
so
also
these
now
have
been
disobedient
with
mercy
resulting
to
you
so
that
they
themselves
may
also
now
be
shown
mercy
32
For
God
has
confined
all
of
them
together
in
disobedience
so
that
he
might
show
all
of
them
mercy
33
O
the
depth
of
Gods
riches
and
wisdom
and
knowledge
How
unsearchable
his
judgments
are
and
beyond
tracing
out
his
ways
are
34
For
who
has
come
to
know
Jehovahs
mind
or
who
has
become
his
adviser
35
Or
who
has
first
given
to
him
so
that
it
must
be
repaid
to
him
36
Because
from
him
and
by
him
and
for
him
are
all
things
To
him
be
the
glory
forever
Amen
1
Therefore
I
appeal
to
you
by
the
compassions
of
God
brothers
to
present
your
bodies
as
a
living
sacrifice
holy
and
acceptable
to
God
a
sacred
service
with
your
power
of
reason
2
And
stop
being
molded
by
this
system
of
things
but
be
transformed
by
making
your
mind
over
so
that
you
may
prove
to
yourselves
the
good
and
acceptable
and
perfect
will
of
God
3
For
through
the
undeserved
kindness
given
to
me
I
tell
everyone
there
among
you
not
to
think
more
of
himself
than
it
is
necessary
to
think
but
to
think
so
as
to
have
a
sound
mind
each
one
as
God
has
given
to
him
a
measure
of
faith
4
For
just
as
we
have
in
one
body
many
members
but
the
members
do
not
all
have
the
same
function
5
so
we
although
many
are
one
body
in
union
with
Christ
but
individually
we
are
members
belonging
to
one
another
6
Since
then
we
have
gifts
that
differ
according
to
the
undeserved
kindness
given
to
us
if
it
is
of
prophecy
let
us
prophesy
in
proportion
to
our
faith
7
or
if
it
is
a
ministry
let
us
be
at
this
ministry
or
the
one
who
teaches
let
him
be
at
his
teaching
8
or
the
one
who
encourages
let
him
give
encouragement
the
one
who
distributes
let
him
do
it
liberally
the
one
who
presides
let
him
do
it
diligently
the
one
who
shows
mercy
let
him
do
it
cheerfully
9
Let
your
love
be
without
hypocrisy
Abhor
what
is
wicked
cling
to
what
is
good
10
In
brotherly
love
have
tender
affection
for
one
another
In
showing
honor
to
one
another
take
the
lead
11
Be
industrious
not
lazy
Be
aglow
with
the
spirit
Slave
for
Jehovah
12
Rejoice
in
the
hope
Endure
under
tribulation
Persevere
in
prayer
13
Share
with
the
holy
ones
according
to
their
needs
Follow
the
course
of
hospitality
14
Keep
on
blessing
those
who
persecute
bless
and
do
not
curse
15
Rejoice
with
those
who
rejoice
weep
with
those
who
weep
16
Have
the
same
attitude
toward
others
as
toward
yourselves
do
not
set
your
mind
on
lofty
things
but
be
led
along
with
the
lowly
things
Do
not
become
wise
in
your
own
eyes
17
Return
evil
for
evil
to
no
one
Take
into
consideration
what
is
fine
from
the
viewpoint
of
all
men
18
If
possible
as
far
as
it
depends
on
you
be
peaceable
with
all
men
19
Do
not
avenge
yourselves
beloved
but
yield
place
to
the
wrath
for
it
is
written
Vengeance
is
mine
I
will
repay

says
Jehovah
20
But
if
your
enemy
is
hungry
feed
him
if
he
is
thirsty
give
him
something
to
drink
for
by
doing
this
you
will
heap
fiery
coals
on
his
head
21
Do
not
let
yourself
be
conquered
by
the
evil
but
keep
conquering
the
evil
with
the
good
1
Let
every
person
be
in
subjection
to
the
superior
authorities
for
there
is
no
authority
except
by
God
the
existing
authorities
stand
placed
in
their
relative
positions
by
God
2
Therefore
whoever
opposes
the
authority
has
taken
a
stand
against
the
arrangement
of
God
those
who
have
taken
a
stand
against
it
will
bring
judgment
against
themselves
3
For
those
rulers
are
an
object
of
fear
not
to
the
good
deed
but
to
the
bad
Do
you
want
to
be
free
of
fear
of
the
authority
Keep
doing
good
and
you
will
have
praise
from
it
4
for
it
is
Gods
minister
to
you
for
your
good
But
if
you
are
doing
what
is
bad
be
in
fear
for
it
is
not
without
purpose
that
it
bears
the
sword
It
is
Gods
minister
an
avenger
to
express
wrath
against
the
one
practicing
what
is
bad
5
There
is
therefore
compelling
reason
for
you
to
be
in
subjection
not
only
on
account
of
that
wrath
but
also
on
account
of
your
conscience
6
That
is
why
you
are
also
paying
taxes
for
they
are
Gods
public
servants
constantly
serving
this
very
purpose
7
Render
to
all
their
dues
to
the
one
who
calls
for
the
tax
the
tax
to
the
one
who
calls
for
the
tribute
the
tribute
to
the
one
who
calls
for
fear
such
fear
to
the
one
who
calls
for
honor
such
honor
8
Do
not
owe
anything
to
anyone
except
to
love
one
another
for
whoever
loves
his
fellow
man
has
fulfilled
the
law
9
For
the
law
code
You
must
not
commit
adultery
you
must
not
murder
you
must
not
steal
you
must
not
covet

and
whatever
other
commandment
there
is
is
summed
up
in
this
saying
You
must
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
10
Love
does
not
work
evil
to
ones
neighbor
therefore
love
is
the
laws
fulfillment
11
And
do
this
because
you
know
the
season
that
it
is
already
the
hour
for
you
to
awake
from
sleep
for
now
our
salvation
is
nearer
than
at
the
time
when
we
became
believers
12
The
night
is
well
along
the
day
has
drawn
near
Let
us
therefore
throw
off
the
works
belonging
to
darkness
and
let
us
put
on
the
weapons
of
the
light
13
Let
us
walk
decently
as
in
the
daytime
not
in
wild
parties
and
drunkenness
not
in
immoral
intercourse
and
brazen
conduct
not
in
strife
and
jealousy
14
But
put
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
do
not
be
planning
ahead
for
the
desires
of
the
flesh
1
Welcome
the
man
having
weaknesses
in
his
faith
but
do
not
pass
judgment
on
differing
opinions
2
One
man
has
faith
to
eat
everything
but
the
man
who
is
weak
eats
only
vegetables
3
Let
the
one
eating
not
look
down
on
the
one
not
eating
and
let
the
one
not
eating
not
judge
the
one
eating
for
God
has
welcomed
him
4
Who
are
you
to
judge
the
servant
of
another
To
his
own
master
he
stands
or
falls
Indeed
he
will
be
made
to
stand
for
Jehovah
can
make
him
stand
5
One
man
judges
one
day
as
above
another
another
judges
one
day
the
same
as
all
others
let
each
one
be
fully
convinced
in
his
own
mind
6
The
one
who
observes
the
day
observes
it
to
Jehovah
Also
the
one
who
eats
eats
to
Jehovah
for
he
gives
thanks
to
God
and
the
one
who
does
not
eat
does
not
eat
to
Jehovah
and
yet
gives
thanks
to
God
7
Not
one
of
us
in
fact
lives
with
regard
to
himself
only
and
no
one
dies
with
regard
to
himself
only
8
For
if
we
live
we
live
to
Jehovah
and
if
we
die
we
die
to
Jehovah
So
both
if
we
live
and
if
we
die
we
belong
to
Jehovah
9
For
to
this
end
Christ
died
and
came
to
life
again
so
that
he
might
be
Lord
over
both
the
dead
and
the
living
10
But
why
do
you
judge
your
brother
Or
why
do
you
also
look
down
on
your
brother
For
we
will
all
stand
before
the
judgment
seat
of
God
11
For
it
is
written
As
surely
as
I
live

says
Jehovah
to
me
every
knee
will
bend
and
every
tongue
will
make
open
acknowledgment
to
God
12
So
then
each
of
us
will
render
an
account
for
himself
to
God
13
Therefore
let
us
not
judge
one
another
any
longer
but
rather
be
determined
not
to
put
a
stumbling
block
or
an
obstacle
before
a
brother
14
I
know
and
am
convinced
in
the
Lord
Jesus
that
nothing
is
unclean
in
itself
only
where
a
man
considers
something
to
be
unclean
to
him
it
is
unclean
15
For
if
your
brother
is
being
offended
because
of
food
you
are
no
longer
walking
according
to
love
Do
not
by
your
food
ruin
that
one
for
whom
Christ
died
16
Therefore
do
not
let
the
good
you
do
be
spoken
of
as
bad
17
For
the
Kingdom
of
God
does
not
mean
eating
and
drinking
but
means
righteousness
and
peace
and
joy
with
holy
spirit
18
For
whoever
slaves
for
Christ
in
this
way
is
acceptable
to
God
and
has
approval
with
men
19
So
then
let
us
pursue
the
things
making
for
peace
and
the
things
that
build
one
another
up
20
Stop
tearing
down
the
work
of
God
just
for
the
sake
of
food
True
all
things
are
clean
but
it
is
detrimental
for
a
man
to
eat
when
it
will
cause
stumbling
21
It
is
best
not
to
eat
meat
or
drink
wine
or
do
anything
over
which
your
brother
stumbles
22
The
faith
that
you
have
keep
it
to
yourself
before
God
Happy
is
the
man
who
does
not
judge
himself
by
what
he
approves
23
But
if
he
has
doubts
he
is
already
condemned
if
he
eats
because
he
does
not
eat
based
on
faith
Indeed
everything
that
is
not
based
on
faith
is
sin
1
We
though
who
are
strong
ought
to
bear
the
weaknesses
of
those
not
strong
and
not
to
be
pleasing
ourselves
2
Let
each
of
us
please
his
neighbor
for
his
good
to
build
him
up
3
For
even
the
Christ
did
not
please
himself
but
just
as
it
is
written
The
reproaches
of
those
reproaching
you
have
fallen
upon
me
4
For
all
the
things
that
were
written
beforehand
were
written
for
our
instruction
so
that
through
our
endurance
and
through
the
comfort
from
the
Scriptures
we
might
have
hope
5
Now
may
the
God
who
supplies
endurance
and
comfort
grant
you
to
have
among
yourselves
the
same
mental
attitude
that
Christ
Jesus
had
6
so
that
unitedly
you
may
with
one
voice
glorify
the
God
and
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
7
So
welcome
one
another
just
as
the
Christ
also
welcomed
you
with
glory
to
God
in
view
8
For
I
tell
you
that
Christ
became
a
minister
of
those
who
are
circumcised
in
behalf
of
Gods
truthfulness
so
as
to
verify
the
promises
He
made
to
their
forefathers
9
and
that
the
nations
might
glorify
God
for
his
mercy
Just
as
it
is
written
That
is
why
I
will
openly
acknowledge
you
among
the
nations
and
to
your
name
I
will
sing
praises
10
And
again
he
says
Be
glad
you
nations
with
his
people
11
And
again
Praise
Jehovah
all
you
nations
and
let
all
the
peoples
praise
him
12
And
again
Isaiah
says
There
will
be
the
root
of
Jesse
the
one
arising
to
rule
nations
on
him
nations
will
rest
their
hope
13
May
the
God
who
gives
hope
fill
you
with
all
joy
and
peace
by
your
trusting
in
him
so
that
you
may
abound
in
hope
with
power
of
holy
spirit
14
Now
I
myself
am
convinced
about
you
my
brothers
that
you
yourselves
are
also
full
of
goodness
filled
with
all
knowledge
and
that
you
are
able
to
admonish
one
another
15
However
I
have
written
to
you
more
outspokenly
on
some
points
so
as
to
give
you
another
reminder
because
of
the
undeserved
kindness
given
to
me
from
God
16
for
me
to
be
a
public
servant
of
Christ
Jesus
to
the
nations
I
am
engaging
in
the
holy
work
of
the
good
news
of
God
so
that
these
nations
might
be
an
acceptable
offering
sanctified
with
holy
spirit
17
So
I
have
reason
to
exult
in
Christ
Jesus
over
the
things
pertaining
to
God
18
For
I
will
not
presume
to
speak
about
anything
except
what
Christ
has
done
through
me
in
order
for
the
nations
to
be
obedient
by
my
word
and
deed
19
with
the
power
of
signs
and
wonders
with
the
power
of
Gods
spirit
so
that
from
Jerusalem
and
in
a
circuit
as
far
as
Illyricum
I
have
thoroughly
preached
the
good
news
about
the
Christ
20
In
this
way
indeed
I
made
it
my
aim
not
to
declare
the
good
news
where
the
name
of
Christ
had
already
been
made
known
so
as
not
to
build
on
another
mans
foundation
21
but
just
as
it
is
written
Those
who
received
no
report
about
him
will
see
and
those
who
have
not
heard
will
understand
22
This
is
also
why
I
was
many
times
hindered
from
coming
to
you
23
But
now
I
no
longer
have
untouched
territory
in
these
regions
and
for
many
years
I
have
longed
to
come
to
you
24
Therefore
when
I
journey
to
Spain
I
hope
that
I
will
see
you
and
be
accompanied
partway
there
by
you
after
I
have
first
enjoyed
your
company
for
a
time
25
But
now
I
am
about
to
travel
to
Jerusalem
to
minister
to
the
holy
ones
26
For
those
in
Macedonia
and
Achaia
have
been
pleased
to
share
their
things
by
a
contribution
to
the
poor
among
the
holy
ones
in
Jerusalem
27
True
they
have
been
pleased
to
do
so
and
indeed
they
were
debtors
to
them
for
if
the
nations
have
shared
in
their
spiritual
things
they
also
owe
it
to
minister
to
them
with
their
material
things
28
So
after
I
have
finished
with
this
and
have
delivered
this
contribution
securely
to
them
I
will
depart
by
way
of
you
for
Spain
29
Moreover
I
know
that
when
I
do
come
to
you
I
will
come
with
a
full
measure
of
blessing
from
Christ
30
Now
I
urge
you
brothers
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
through
the
love
of
the
spirit
that
you
exert
yourselves
with
me
in
prayers
to
God
for
me
31
that
I
may
be
rescued
from
the
unbelievers
in
Judea
and
that
my
ministry
in
behalf
of
Jerusalem
may
prove
to
be
acceptable
to
the
holy
ones
32
so
that
by
Gods
will
I
will
come
to
you
with
joy
and
be
refreshed
together
with
you
33
May
the
God
who
gives
peace
be
with
all
of
you
Amen
1
I
am
introducing
to
you
Phoebe
our
sister
who
is
a
minister
of
the
congregation
that
is
in
Cenchreae
2
so
that
you
may
welcome
her
in
the
Lord
in
a
way
worthy
of
the
holy
ones
and
give
her
whatever
help
she
may
need
for
she
herself
also
proved
to
be
a
defender
of
many
including
me
3
Give
my
greetings
to
Prisca
and
Aquila
my
fellow
workers
in
Christ
Jesus
4
who
have
risked
their
own
necks
for
me
and
to
whom
not
only
I
but
also
all
the
congregations
of
the
nations
give
thanks
5
Also
greet
the
congregation
that
is
in
their
house
Greet
my
beloved
Epaenetus
who
is
a
firstfruits
of
Asia
for
Christ
6
Greet
Mary
who
has
worked
hard
for
you
7
Greet
Andronicus
and
Junias
my
relatives
and
fellow
prisoners
who
are
men
well-known
to
the
apostles
and
who
have
been
in
union
with
Christ
longer
than
I
have
8
Give
my
greetings
to
Ampliatus
my
beloved
in
the
Lord
9
Greet
Urbanus
our
fellow
worker
in
Christ
and
my
beloved
Stachys
10
Greet
Apelles
the
approved
one
in
Christ
Greet
those
from
the
household
of
Aristobulus
11
Greet
Herodion
my
relative
Greet
those
from
the
household
of
Narcissus
who
are
in
the
Lord
12
Greet
Tryphaena
and
Tryphosa
women
who
are
working
hard
in
the
Lord
Greet
Persis
our
beloved
one
for
she
has
worked
hard
in
the
Lord
13
Greet
Rufus
the
chosen
one
in
the
Lord
and
his
mother
and
mine
14
Greet
Asyncritus
Phlegon
Hermes

Hermas
and
the
brothers
with
them
15
Greet
Philologus
and
Julia
Nereus
and
his
sister
and
Olympas
and
all
the
holy
ones
with
them
16
Greet
one
another
with
a
holy
kiss
All
the
congregations
of
the
Christ
greet
you
17
Now
I
urge
you
brothers
to
keep
your
eye
on
those
who
create
divisions
and
causes
for
stumbling
contrary
to
the
teaching
that
you
have
learned
and
avoid
them
18
For
men
of
that
sort
are
slaves
not
of
our
Lord
Christ
but
of
their
own
appetites
and
by
smooth
talk
and
flattering
speech
they
seduce
the
hearts
of
unsuspecting
ones
19
Your
obedience
has
come
to
the
notice
of
all
and
so
I
rejoice
over
you
But
I
want
you
to
be
wise
as
to
what
is
good
but
innocent
as
to
what
is
evil
20
For
his
part
the
God
who
gives
peace
will
crush
Satan
under
your
feet
shortly
May
the
undeserved
kindness
of
our
Lord
Jesus
be
with
you
21
Timothy
my
fellow
worker
greets
you
and
so
do
Lucius
Jason
and
Sosipater
my
relatives
22
I
Tertius
who
have
done
the
writing
of
this
letter
greet
you
in
the
Lord
23
Gaius
host
to
me
and
to
all
the
congregation
greets
you
Erastus
the
city
treasurer
greets
you
and
so
does
Quartus
his
brother
24
——
25
Now
to
Him
who
can
make
you
firm
according
to
the
good
news
I
declare
and
the
preaching
of
Jesus
Christ
according
to
the
revelation
of
the
sacred
secret
that
has
been
kept
in
silence
for
long-lasting
times
26
but
has
now
been
made
manifest
and
has
been
made
known
through
the
prophetic
Scriptures
among
all
the
nations
according
to
the
command
of
the
everlasting
God
to
promote
obedience
by
faith
27
to
God
who
alone
is
wise
be
the
glory
through
Jesus
Christ
forever
Amen
1
Paul
called
to
be
an
apostle
of
Christ
Jesus
by
Gods
will
and
Sosthenes
our
brother
2
to
the
congregation
of
God
that
is
in
Corinth
to
you
who
have
been
sanctified
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
called
to
be
holy
ones
together
with
all
those
everywhere
who
are
calling
on
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
their
Lord
and
ours
3
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
4
I
always
thank
my
God
for
you
in
view
of
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
given
to
you
in
Christ
Jesus
5
because
in
everything
you
have
been
enriched
in
him
in
full
ability
to
speak
and
in
full
knowledge
6
just
as
the
witness
about
the
Christ
has
been
made
firm
among
you
7
so
that
you
do
not
lack
in
any
gift
at
all
while
you
are
eagerly
waiting
for
the
revelation
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
8
He
will
also
make
you
firm
to
the
end
so
that
you
may
be
open
to
no
accusation
in
the
day
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
9
God
is
faithful
by
whom
you
were
called
into
fellowship
with
his
Son
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
10
Now
I
urge
you
brothers
through
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
that
you
should
all
speak
in
agreement
and
that
there
should
be
no
divisions
among
you
but
that
you
may
be
completely
united
in
the
same
mind
and
in
the
same
line
of
thought
11
For
some
from
the
house
of
Chloe
have
informed
me
regarding
you
my
brothers
that
there
are
dissensions
among
you
12
What
I
mean
is
this
that
each
one
of
you
says
I
belong
to
Paul

But
I
to
Apollos

But
I
to
Cephas

But
I
to
Christ
13
Is
the
Christ
divided
Paul
was
not
executed
on
the
stake
for
you
was
he
Or
were
you
baptized
in
the
name
of
Paul
14
I
thank
God
that
I
baptized
none
of
you
except
Crispus
and
Gaius
15
so
that
no
one
may
say
that
you
were
baptized
in
my
name
16
Yes
I
also
baptized
the
household
of
Stephanas
As
for
the
rest
I
do
not
know
whether
I
baptized
anyone
else
17
For
Christ
sent
me
not
to
baptize
but
to
declare
the
good
news
and
not
with
wisdom
of
speech
so
that
the
torture
stake
of
the
Christ
should
not
be
made
useless
18
For
the
speech
about
the
torture
stake
is
foolishness
to
those
who
are
perishing
but
to
us
who
are
being
saved
it
is
Gods
power
19
For
it
is
written
I
will
make
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
men
perish
and
the
intelligence
of
the
intellectuals
I
will
reject
20
Where
is
the
wise
man
Where
is
the
scribe
Where
is
the
debater
of
this
system
of
things
Has
not
God
made
the
wisdom
of
the
world
foolish
21
For
since
in
the
wisdom
of
God
the
world
did
not
get
to
know
God
through
its
wisdom
God
was
pleased
through
the
foolishness
of
what
is
preached
to
save
those
believing
22
For
the
Jews
ask
for
signs
and
the
Greeks
look
for
wisdom
23
but
we
preach
Christ
executed
on
the
stake
to
the
Jews
a
cause
for
stumbling
but
to
the
nations
foolishness
24
However
to
those
who
are
called
both
Jews
and
Greeks
Christ
is
the
power
of
God
and
the
wisdom
of
God
25
Because
a
foolish
thing
of
God
is
wiser
than
men
and
a
weak
thing
of
God
is
stronger
than
men
26
For
you
see
his
calling
of
you
brothers
that
there
are
not
many
wise
in
a
fleshly
way
not
many
powerful
not
many
of
noble
birth
27
but
God
chose
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
to
put
the
wise
men
to
shame
and
God
chose
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
put
the
strong
things
to
shame
28
and
God
chose
the
insignificant
things
of
the
world
and
the
things
looked
down
on
the
things
that
are
not
to
bring
to
nothing
the
things
that
are
29
so
that
no
one
might
boast
in
the
sight
of
God
30
But
it
is
due
to
him
that
you
are
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
who
has
become
to
us
wisdom
from
God
also
righteousness
and
sanctification
and
release
by
ransom
31
so
that
it
may
be
just
as
it
is
written
The
one
who
boasts
let
him
boast
in
Jehovah
1
So
when
I
came
to
you
brothers
I
did
not
come
with
extravagant
speech
or
wisdom
declaring
the
sacred
secret
of
God
to
you
2
For
I
decided
not
to
know
anything
among
you
except
Jesus
Christ
and
him
executed
on
the
stake
3
And
I
came
to
you
in
weakness
and
in
fear
and
with
much
trembling
4
and
my
speech
and
what
I
preached
were
not
with
persuasive
words
of
wisdom
but
with
a
demonstration
of
spirit
and
power
5
so
that
your
faith
might
be
not
in
mens
wisdom
but
in
Gods
power
6
Now
we
speak
wisdom
among
those
who
are
mature
but
not
the
wisdom
of
this
system
of
things
nor
that
of
the
rulers
of
this
system
of
things
who
are
to
come
to
nothing
7
But
we
speak
Gods
wisdom
in
a
sacred
secret
the
hidden
wisdom
which
God
foreordained
before
the
systems
of
things
for
our
glory
8
It
is
this
wisdom
that
none
of
the
rulers
of
this
system
of
things
came
to
know
for
if
they
had
known
it
they
would
not
have
executed
the
glorious
Lord
9
But
just
as
it
is
written
Eye
has
not
seen
and
ear
has
not
heard
nor
have
there
been
conceived
in
the
heart
of
man
the
things
that
God
has
prepared
for
those
who
love
him
10
For
it
is
to
us
God
has
revealed
them
through
his
spirit
for
the
spirit
searches
into
all
things
even
the
deep
things
of
God
11
For
who
among
men
knows
the
things
of
a
man
except
the
mans
spirit
within
him
So
too
no
one
has
come
to
know
the
things
of
God
except
the
spirit
of
God
12
Now
we
received
not
the
spirit
of
the
world
but
the
spirit
that
is
from
God
so
that
we
might
know
the
things
that
have
been
kindly
given
us
by
God
13
These
things
we
also
speak
not
with
words
taught
by
human
wisdom
but
with
those
taught
by
the
spirit
as
we
explain
spiritual
matters
with
spiritual
words
14
But
a
physical
man
does
not
accept
the
things
of
the
spirit
of
God
for
they
are
foolishness
to
him
and
he
cannot
get
to
know
them
because
they
are
examined
spiritually
15
However
the
spiritual
man
examines
all
things
but
he
himself
is
not
examined
by
any
man
16
For
who
has
come
to
know
the
mind
of
Jehovah
so
that
he
may
instruct
him
But
we
do
have
the
mind
of
Christ
1
So
brothers
I
was
not
able
to
speak
to
you
as
to
spiritual
men
but
as
to
fleshly
men
as
to
infants
in
Christ
2
I
fed
you
milk
not
solid
food
for
you
were
not
yet
strong
enough
In
fact
neither
are
you
strong
enough
now
3
for
you
are
still
fleshly
Since
there
are
jealousy
and
strife
among
you
are
you
not
fleshly
and
are
you
not
walking
as
men
do
4
For
when
one
says
I
belong
to
Paul

but
another
says
I
to
Apollos

are
you
not
acting
like
mere
men
5
What
then
is
Apollos
Yes
what
is
Paul
Ministers
through
whom
you
became
believers
just
as
the
Lord
granted
each
one
6
I
planted
Apollos
watered
but
God
kept
making
it
grow
7
so
that
neither
is
the
one
who
plants
anything
nor
is
the
one
who
waters
but
God
who
makes
it
grow
8
Now
the
one
who
plants
and
the
one
who
waters
are
one
but
each
person
will
receive
his
own
reward
according
to
his
own
work
9
For
we
are
Gods
fellow
workers
You
are
Gods
field
under
cultivation
Gods
building
10
According
to
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
that
was
given
to
me
I
laid
a
foundation
as
a
skilled
master
builder
but
someone
else
is
building
on
it
But
let
each
one
keep
watching
how
he
is
building
on
it
11
For
no
one
can
lay
any
other
foundation
than
what
is
laid
which
is
Jesus
Christ
12
Now
if
anyone
builds
on
the
foundation
gold
silver
precious
stones
wood
hay
or
straw
13
each
ones
work
will
be
shown
for
what
it
is
for
the
day
will
show
it
up
because
it
will
be
revealed
by
means
of
fire
and
the
fire
itself
will
prove
what
sort
of
work
each
one
has
built
14
If
anyones
work
that
he
has
built
on
it
remains
he
will
receive
a
reward
15
if
anyones
work
is
burned
up
he
will
suffer
loss
but
he
himself
will
be
saved
yet
if
so
it
will
be
as
through
fire
16
Do
you
not
know
that
you
yourselves
are
Gods
temple
and
that
the
spirit
of
God
dwells
in
you
17
If
anyone
destroys
the
temple
of
God
God
will
destroy
him
for
the
temple
of
God
is
holy
and
you
are
that
temple
18
Let
no
one
deceive
himself
If
anyone
among
you
thinks
he
is
wise
in
this
system
of
things
let
him
become
a
fool
so
that
he
may
become
wise
19
For
the
wisdom
of
this
world
is
foolishness
with
God
for
it
is
written
He
catches
the
wise
in
their
own
cunning
20
And
again
Jehovah
knows
that
the
reasonings
of
the
wise
men
are
futile
21
So
let
no
one
boast
in
men
for
all
things
belong
to
you
22
whether
Paul
or
Apollos
or
Cephas
or
the
world
or
life
or
death
or
things
now
here
or
things
to
come
all
things
belong
to
you
23
in
turn
you
belong
to
Christ
Christ
in
turn
belongs
to
God
1
A
man
should
regard
us
as
attendants
of
Christ
and
stewards
of
Gods
sacred
secrets
2
In
this
regard
what
is
expected
of
stewards
is
that
they
be
found
faithful
3
Now
to
me
it
is
of
very
little
importance
to
be
examined
by
you
or
by
a
human
tribunal
In
fact
I
do
not
even
examine
myself
4
For
I
am
not
conscious
of
anything
against
myself
But
by
this
I
am
not
proved
righteous
the
one
who
examines
me
is
Jehovah
5
Therefore
do
not
judge
anything
before
the
due
time
until
the
Lord
comes
He
will
bring
the
secret
things
of
darkness
to
light
and
make
known
the
intentions
of
the
hearts
and
then
each
one
will
receive
his
praise
from
God
6
Now
brothers
these
things
I
have
applied
to
myself
and
Apollos
for
your
good
that
through
us
you
may
learn
the
rule
Do
not
go
beyond
the
things
that
are
written

so
that
you
may
not
be
puffed
up
with
pride
favoring
one
against
the
other
7
For
who
makes
you
different
from
another
Indeed
what
do
you
have
that
you
did
not
receive
If
in
fact
you
did
receive
it
why
do
you
boast
as
though
you
did
not
receive
it
8
Are
you
already
satisfied
Are
you
already
rich
Have
you
begun
ruling
as
kings
without
us
I
really
wish
that
you
had
begun
ruling
as
kings
so
that
we
also
might
rule
with
you
as
kings
9
For
it
seems
to
me
that
God
has
put
us
the
apostles
last
on
exhibition
as
men
condemned
to
death
because
we
have
become
a
theatrical
spectacle
to
the
world
and
to
angels
and
to
men
10
We
are
fools
because
of
Christ
but
you
are
discreet
in
Christ
we
are
weak
but
you
are
strong
you
are
held
in
honor
but
we
in
dishonor
11
Down
to
this
very
hour
we
continue
to
hunger
and
thirst
and
to
be
poorly
clothed
and
to
be
beaten
and
to
be
homeless
12
and
to
toil
working
with
our
own
hands
When
insulted
we
bless
when
persecuted
we
patiently
endure
13
when
slandered
we
answer
mildly
we
have
become
as
the
refuse
of
the
world
the
offscouring
of
all
things
until
now
14
I
am
writing
these
things
not
to
put
you
to
shame
but
to
admonish
you
as
my
beloved
children
15
For
though
you
may
have
10000
guardians
in
Christ
you
certainly
do
not
have
many
fathers
for
in
Christ
Jesus
I
have
become
your
father
through
the
good
news
16
I
urge
you
therefore
become
imitators
of
me
17
That
is
why
I
am
sending
Timothy
to
you
because
he
is
my
beloved
and
faithful
child
in
the
Lord
He
will
remind
you
of
my
methods
in
connection
with
Christ
Jesus
just
as
I
am
teaching
everywhere
in
every
congregation
18
Some
are
puffed
up
with
pride
as
though
I
were
not
coming
to
you
19
But
I
will
come
to
you
shortly
if
Jehovah
wills
and
I
will
get
to
know
not
the
speech
of
those
who
are
puffed
up
with
pride
but
their
power
20
For
the
Kingdom
of
God
is
a
matter
not
of
speech
but
of
power
21
Which
do
you
prefer
Shall
I
come
to
you
with
a
rod
or
with
love
and
mildness
of
spirit
1
Actually
sexual
immorality
is
reported
among
you
and
such
immorality
as
is
not
even
found
among
the
nations—of
a
man
living
with
his
fathers
wife
2
And
are
you
proud
of
it
Should
you
not
rather
mourn
so
that
the
man
who
committed
this
deed
should
be
taken
away
from
your
midst
3
Although
absent
in
body
I
am
present
in
spirit
and
I
have
already
judged
the
man
who
has
done
this
as
if
I
were
actually
with
you
4
When
you
are
gathered
together
in
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
and
knowing
that
I
am
with
you
in
spirit
along
with
the
power
of
our
Lord
Jesus
5
you
must
hand
such
a
man
over
to
Satan
for
the
destruction
of
the
flesh
so
that
the
spirit
may
be
saved
in
the
day
of
the
Lord
6
Your
boasting
is
not
good
Do
you
not
know
that
a
little
leaven
ferments
the
whole
batch
of
dough
7
Clear
away
the
old
leaven
so
that
you
may
be
a
new
batch
inasmuch
as
you
are
free
from
ferment
For
indeed
Christ
our
Passover
lamb
has
been
sacrificed
8
So
then
let
us
keep
the
festival
not
with
old
leaven
nor
with
leaven
of
badness
and
wickedness
but
with
unleavened
bread
of
sincerity
and
truth
9
In
my
letter
I
wrote
you
to
stop
keeping
company
with
sexually
immoral
people
10
not
meaning
entirely
with
the
sexually
immoral
people
of
this
world
or
the
greedy
people
or
extortioners
or
idolaters
Otherwise
you
would
actually
have
to
get
out
of
the
world
11
But
now
I
am
writing
you
to
stop
keeping
company
with
anyone
called
a
brother
who
is
sexually
immoral
or
a
greedy
person
or
an
idolater
or
a
reviler
or
a
drunkard
or
an
extortioner
not
even
eating
with
such
a
man
12
For
what
do
I
have
to
do
with
judging
those
outside
Do
you
not
judge
those
inside
13
while
God
judges
those
outside
Remove
the
wicked
person
from
among
yourselves
1
Does
any
one
of
you
who
has
a
dispute
with
another
dare
to
go
to
court
before
unrighteous
men
and
not
before
the
holy
ones
2
Or
do
you
not
know
that
the
holy
ones
will
judge
the
world
And
if
the
world
is
to
be
judged
by
you
are
you
not
competent
to
try
very
trivial
matters
3
Do
you
not
know
that
we
will
judge
angels
Then
why
not
matters
of
this
life
4
If
then
you
do
have
matters
of
this
life
to
be
tried
is
it
the
men
looked
down
on
in
the
congregation
whom
you
assign
as
judges
5
I
am
speaking
to
move
you
to
shame
Is
there
not
one
wise
man
among
you
who
is
able
to
judge
between
his
brothers
6
Instead
brother
goes
to
court
against
brother
and
before
unbelievers
at
that
7
Really
it
is
already
a
defeat
for
you
when
you
have
lawsuits
with
one
another
Why
not
rather
let
yourselves
be
wronged
Why
do
you
not
rather
let
yourselves
be
defrauded
8
Instead
you
wrong
and
defraud
and
your
brothers
at
that
9
Or
do
you
not
know
that
unrighteous
people
will
not
inherit
Gods
Kingdom
Do
not
be
misled
Those
who
are
sexually
immoral
idolaters
adulterers
men
who
submit
to
homosexual
acts
men
who
practice
homosexuality
10
thieves
greedy
people
drunkards
revilers
and
extortioners
will
not
inherit
Gods
Kingdom
11
And
yet
that
is
what
some
of
you
were
But
you
have
been
washed
clean
you
have
been
sanctified
you
have
been
declared
righteous
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
with
the
spirit
of
our
God
12
All
things
are
lawful
for
me
but
not
all
things
are
advantageous
All
things
are
lawful
for
me
but
I
will
not
let
myself
be
controlled
by
anything
13
Food
is
for
the
stomach
and
the
stomach
is
for
food
but
God
will
bring
both
of
them
to
nothing
The
body
is
not
for
sexual
immorality
but
for
the
Lord
and
the
Lord
is
for
the
body
14
But
God
raised
up
the
Lord
and
will
also
raise
us
up
out
of
death
through
his
power
15
Do
you
not
know
that
your
bodies
are
members
of
Christ
Should
I
then
take
the
members
of
the
Christ
away
and
join
them
to
a
prostitute
By
no
means
16
Do
you
not
know
that
anyone
who
is
joined
to
a
prostitute
is
one
body
with
her
For
the
two

says
he
will
be
one
flesh
17
But
whoever
is
joined
to
the
Lord
is
one
with
him
in
spirit
18
Flee
from
sexual
immorality
Every
other
sin
that
a
man
may
commit
is
outside
his
body
but
whoever
practices
sexual
immorality
is
sinning
against
his
own
body
19
Do
you
not
know
that
your
body
is
the
temple
of
the
holy
spirit
within
you
which
you
have
from
God
Also
you
do
not
belong
to
yourselves
20
for
you
were
bought
with
a
price
By
all
means
glorify
God
in
your
body
1
Now
concerning
the
things
about
which
you
wrote
it
is
better
for
a
man
not
to
touch
a
woman
2
but
because
of
the
prevalence
of
sexual
immorality
let
each
man
have
his
own
wife
and
each
woman
have
her
own
husband
3
Let
the
husband
give
to
his
wife
her
due
and
let
the
wife
also
do
likewise
to
her
husband
4
The
wife
does
not
have
authority
over
her
own
body
but
her
husband
does
likewise
the
husband
does
not
have
authority
over
his
own
body
but
his
wife
does
5
Do
not
deprive
each
other
except
by
mutual
consent
for
an
appointed
time
so
that
you
may
devote
time
to
prayer
and
may
come
together
again
in
order
that
Satan
may
not
keep
tempting
you
for
your
lack
of
self-control
6
However
I
say
this
by
way
of
concession
not
as
a
command
7
But
I
wish
all
men
were
as
I
am
Nevertheless
each
one
has
his
own
gift
from
God
one
in
this
way
another
in
that
way
8
Now
I
say
to
those
who
are
unmarried
and
to
the
widows
that
it
is
better
for
them
if
they
remain
as
I
am
9
But
if
they
do
not
have
self-control
let
them
marry
for
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
be
inflamed
with
passion
10
To
the
married
people
I
give
instructions
not
I
but
the
Lord
that
a
wife
should
not
separate
from
her
husband
11
But
if
she
does
separate
let
her
remain
unmarried
or
else
be
reconciled
with
her
husband
and
a
husband
should
not
leave
his
wife
12
But
to
the
others
I
say
yes
I
not
the
Lord
If
any
brother
has
an
unbelieving
wife
and
she
is
agreeable
to
staying
with
him
let
him
not
leave
her
13
and
if
a
woman
has
an
unbelieving
husband
and
he
is
agreeable
to
staying
with
her
let
her
not
leave
her
husband
14
For
the
unbelieving
husband
is
sanctified
in
relation
to
his
wife
and
the
unbelieving
wife
is
sanctified
in
relation
to
the
brother
otherwise
your
children
would
be
unclean
but
now
they
are
holy
15
But
if
the
unbelieving
one
chooses
to
depart
let
him
depart
a
brother
or
a
sister
is
not
bound
under
such
circumstances
but
God
has
called
you
to
peace
16
For
wife
how
do
you
know
whether
you
will
save
your
husband
Or
husband
how
do
you
know
whether
you
will
save
your
wife
17
Nevertheless
just
as
Jehovah
has
given
each
one
a
portion
let
each
one
so
walk
as
God
has
called
him
And
so
I
give
this
directive
in
all
the
congregations
18
Was
any
man
already
circumcised
when
he
was
called
Let
him
not
undo
his
circumcision
Has
any
man
been
called
while
uncircumcised
Let
him
not
get
circumcised
19
Circumcision
means
nothing
and
uncircumcision
means
nothing
what
means
something
is
the
observing
of
Gods
commandments
20
In
whatever
state
each
one
was
called
let
him
remain
in
it
21
Were
you
called
when
a
slave
Do
not
let
it
concern
you
but
if
you
can
become
free
then
seize
the
opportunity
22
For
anyone
who
was
called
in
the
Lord
when
a
slave
is
the
Lords
freedman
likewise
anyone
who
was
called
when
a
freeman
is
a
slave
of
Christ
23
You
were
bought
with
a
price
stop
becoming
slaves
of
men
24
In
whatever
state
each
one
was
called
brothers
let
him
remain
in
it
before
God
25
Now
concerning
virgins
I
have
no
command
from
the
Lord
but
I
give
my
opinion
as
one
who
had
mercy
shown
him
by
the
Lord
to
be
faithful
26
Therefore
I
think
that
it
is
best
for
a
man
to
continue
as
he
is
in
view
of
the
present
difficulty
27
Are
you
bound
to
a
wife
Stop
seeking
a
release
Are
you
freed
from
a
wife
Stop
seeking
a
wife
28
But
even
if
you
did
marry
you
would
commit
no
sin
And
if
a
virgin
married
such
a
person
would
commit
no
sin
However
those
who
do
will
have
tribulation
in
their
flesh
But
I
am
trying
to
spare
you
29
Moreover
this
I
say
brothers
the
time
left
is
reduced
From
now
on
let
those
who
have
wives
be
as
though
they
had
none
30
and
those
who
weep
as
those
who
do
not
weep
and
those
who
rejoice
as
those
who
do
not
rejoice
and
those
who
buy
as
those
who
do
not
possess
31
and
those
making
use
of
the
world
as
those
not
using
it
to
the
full
for
the
scene
of
this
world
is
changing
32
Indeed
I
want
you
to
be
free
from
anxiety
The
unmarried
man
is
anxious
for
the
things
of
the
Lord
how
he
may
gain
the
Lords
approval
33
But
the
married
man
is
anxious
for
the
things
of
the
world
how
he
may
gain
the
approval
of
his
wife
34
and
he
is
divided
Further
the
unmarried
woman
as
well
as
the
virgin
is
anxious
for
the
things
of
the
Lord
that
she
may
be
holy
both
in
her
body
and
in
her
spirit
However
the
married
woman
is
anxious
for
the
things
of
the
world
how
she
may
gain
the
approval
of
her
husband
35
But
I
am
saying
this
for
your
personal
advantage
not
to
restrict
you
but
to
move
you
to
what
is
appropriate
and
to
constant
devotion
to
the
Lord
without
distraction
36
But
if
anyone
thinks
he
is
behaving
improperly
by
remaining
unmarried
and
if
he
is
past
the
bloom
of
youth
then
this
is
what
should
take
place
Let
him
do
what
he
wants
he
does
not
sin
Let
them
marry
37
But
if
anyone
stands
settled
in
his
heart
and
has
no
necessity
but
has
authority
over
his
own
will
and
has
made
the
decision
in
his
own
heart
to
remain
unmarried
he
will
do
well
38
So
also
whoever
marries
does
well
but
whoever
does
not
marry
will
do
better
39
A
wife
is
bound
as
long
as
her
husband
is
alive
But
if
her
husband
should
fall
asleep
in
death
she
is
free
to
be
married
to
whomever
she
wants
only
in
the
Lord
40
But
in
my
opinion
she
is
happier
if
she
remains
as
she
is
and
I
certainly
think
I
also
have
Gods
spirit
1
Now
concerning
food
offered
to
idols
We
know
we
all
have
knowledge
Knowledge
puffs
up
but
love
builds
up
2
If
anyone
thinks
he
knows
something
he
does
not
yet
know
it
as
he
should
know
it
3
But
if
anyone
loves
God
this
one
is
known
by
him
4
Now
concerning
the
eating
of
food
offered
to
idols
we
know
that
an
idol
is
nothing
in
the
world
and
that
there
is
no
God
but
one
5
For
even
though
there
are
so-called
gods
whether
in
heaven
or
on
earth
just
as
there
are
many
gods
and
many
lords

6
there
is
actually
to
us
one
God
the
Father
from
whom
all
things
are
and
we
for
him
and
there
is
one
Lord
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
all
things
are
and
we
through
him
7
However
not
all
have
this
knowledge
But
some
because
of
their
former
association
with
the
idol
eat
food
as
something
sacrificed
to
an
idol
and
their
conscience
being
weak
is
defiled
8
But
food
will
not
bring
us
nearer
to
God
we
are
no
worse
off
if
we
do
not
eat
nor
better
off
if
we
eat
9
But
keep
watching
that
your
right
to
choose
does
not
somehow
become
a
stumbling
block
to
those
who
are
weak
10
For
if
anyone
should
see
you
who
have
knowledge
having
a
meal
in
an
idol
temple
will
not
the
conscience
of
that
one
who
is
weak
be
emboldened
to
the
point
of
eating
food
offered
to
idols
11
So
by
your
knowledge
the
man
who
is
weak
is
being
ruined
your
brother
for
whose
sake
Christ
died
12
When
you
sin
against
your
brothers
in
this
way
and
wound
their
weak
conscience
you
are
sinning
against
Christ
13
That
is
why
if
food
makes
my
brother
stumble
I
will
never
again
eat
meat
at
all
so
that
I
will
not
make
my
brother
stumble
1
Am
I
not
free
Am
I
not
an
apostle
Have
I
not
seen
Jesus
our
Lord
Are
you
not
my
work
in
the
Lord
2
Even
if
I
am
not
an
apostle
to
others
I
most
certainly
am
to
you
For
you
are
the
seal
confirming
my
apostleship
in
the
Lord
3
My
defense
to
those
who
examine
me
is
as
follows
4
We
have
the
right
to
eat
and
drink
do
we
not
5
We
have
the
right
to
be
accompanied
by
a
believing
wife
as
the
rest
of
the
apostles
and
the
Lords
brothers
and
Cephas
do
we
not
6
Or
is
it
only
Barnabas
and
I
who
do
not
have
the
right
to
refrain
from
working
for
a
living
7
What
soldier
ever
serves
at
his
own
expense
Who
plants
a
vineyard
and
does
not
eat
of
its
fruit
Or
who
shepherds
a
flock
and
does
not
partake
of
some
of
the
milk
of
the
flock
8
Am
I
saying
these
things
from
a
human
viewpoint
Or
does
not
the
Law
also
say
these
things
9
For
it
is
written
in
the
Law
of
Moses
You
must
not
muzzle
a
bull
when
it
is
threshing
out
the
grain
Is
it
bulls
that
God
is
concerned
about
10
Or
is
it
actually
for
our
sakes
that
he
says
it
It
was
really
written
for
our
sakes
because
the
man
who
plows
and
the
man
who
threshes
ought
to
do
so
in
the
hope
of
receiving
a
share
11
If
we
have
sown
spiritual
things
among
you
is
it
too
much
if
we
reap
material
support
from
you
12
If
other
men
have
this
rightful
claim
over
you
do
we
not
have
it
much
more
so
Nevertheless
we
have
not
made
use
of
this
right
but
we
are
enduring
all
things
so
that
we
might
not
in
any
way
hinder
the
good
news
about
the
Christ
13
Do
you
not
know
that
the
men
performing
sacred
duties
eat
the
things
of
the
temple
and
that
those
regularly
serving
at
the
altar
receive
a
share
from
the
altar
14
In
this
way
too
the
Lord
commanded
for
those
proclaiming
the
good
news
to
live
by
means
of
the
good
news
15
But
I
have
not
made
use
of
a
single
one
of
these
provisions
Indeed
I
have
not
written
these
things
so
that
this
would
be
done
for
me
for
it
would
be
better
to
die
than—no
man
will
take
away
my
grounds
for
boasting
16
Now
if
I
am
declaring
the
good
news
it
is
no
reason
for
me
to
boast
for
necessity
is
laid
upon
me
Really
woe
to
me
if
I
do
not
declare
the
good
news
17
If
I
do
this
willingly
I
have
a
reward
but
even
if
I
do
it
against
my
will
I
still
have
a
stewardship
entrusted
to
me
18
What
then
is
my
reward
That
when
I
declare
the
good
news
I
may
offer
the
good
news
without
cost
to
avoid
abusing
my
authority
in
the
good
news
19
For
though
I
am
free
from
all
people
I
have
made
myself
the
slave
to
all
so
that
I
may
gain
as
many
people
as
possible
20
To
the
Jews
I
became
as
a
Jew
in
order
to
gain
Jews
to
those
under
law
I
became
as
under
law
though
I
myself
am
not
under
law
in
order
to
gain
those
under
law
21
To
those
without
law
I
became
as
without
law
although
I
am
not
without
law
toward
God
but
under
law
toward
Christ
in
order
to
gain
those
without
law
22
To
the
weak
I
became
weak
in
order
to
gain
the
weak
I
have
become
all
things
to
people
of
all
sorts
so
that
I
might
by
all
possible
means
save
some
23
But
I
do
all
things
for
the
sake
of
the
good
news
in
order
to
share
it
with
others
24
Do
you
not
know
that
the
runners
in
a
race
all
run
but
only
one
receives
the
prize
Run
in
such
a
way
that
you
may
win
it
25
Now
everyone
competing
in
a
contest
exercises
self-control
in
all
things
Of
course
they
do
it
to
receive
a
crown
that
can
perish
but
we
one
that
does
not
perish
26
Therefore
the
way
I
am
running
is
not
aimlessly
the
way
I
am
aiming
my
blows
is
so
as
not
to
be
striking
the
air
27
but
I
pummel
my
body
and
lead
it
as
a
slave
so
that
after
I
have
preached
to
others
I
myself
should
not
become
disapproved
somehow
1
Now
I
want
you
to
know
brothers
that
our
forefathers
were
all
under
the
cloud
and
all
passed
through
the
sea
2
and
all
got
baptized
into
Moses
by
means
of
the
cloud
and
of
the
sea
3
and
all
ate
the
same
spiritual
food
4
and
all
drank
the
same
spiritual
drink
For
they
used
to
drink
from
the
spiritual
rock
that
followed
them
and
that
rock
meant
the
Christ
5
Nevertheless
God
was
not
pleased
with
most
of
them
for
they
were
struck
down
in
the
wilderness
6
Now
these
things
became
examples
for
us
in
order
for
us
not
to
desire
injurious
things
as
they
desired
them
7
Neither
become
idolaters
as
some
of
them
did
just
as
it
is
written
The
people
sat
down
to
eat
and
drink
Then
they
got
up
to
have
a
good
time
8
Neither
let
us
practice
sexual
immorality
as
some
of
them
committed
sexual
immorality
only
to
fall
23000
of
them
in
one
day
9
Neither
let
us
put
Jehovah
to
the
test
as
some
of
them
put
him
to
the
test
only
to
perish
by
the
serpents
10
Neither
be
murmurers
as
some
of
them
murmured
only
to
perish
by
the
destroyer
11
Now
these
things
happened
to
them
as
examples
and
they
were
written
for
a
warning
to
us
upon
whom
the
ends
of
the
systems
of
things
have
come
12
So
let
the
one
who
thinks
he
is
standing
beware
that
he
does
not
fall
13
No
temptation
has
come
upon
you
except
what
is
common
to
men
But
God
is
faithful
and
he
will
not
let
you
be
tempted
beyond
what
you
can
bear
but
along
with
the
temptation
he
will
also
make
the
way
out
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
endure
it
14
Therefore
my
beloved
ones
flee
from
idolatry
15
I
speak
as
to
men
with
discernment
judge
for
yourselves
what
I
say
16
The
cup
of
blessing
that
we
bless
is
it
not
a
sharing
in
the
blood
of
the
Christ
The
loaf
that
we
break
is
it
not
a
sharing
in
the
body
of
the
Christ
17
Because
there
is
one
loaf
we
although
many
are
one
body
for
we
are
all
partaking
of
that
one
loaf
18
Look
at
Israel
in
the
fleshly
sense
Are
not
those
who
eat
the
sacrifices
sharers
with
the
altar
19
What
then
am
I
saying
That
what
is
sacrificed
to
an
idol
is
anything
or
that
an
idol
is
anything
20
No
but
I
say
that
what
the
nations
sacrifice
they
sacrifice
to
demons
and
not
to
God
and
I
do
not
want
you
to
become
sharers
with
the
demons
21
You
cannot
be
drinking
the
cup
of
Jehovah
and
the
cup
of
demons
you
cannot
be
partaking
of
the
table
of
Jehovah
and
the
table
of
demons
22
Or
are
we
inciting
Jehovah
to
jealousy
We
are
not
stronger
than
he
is
are
we
23
All
things
are
lawful
but
not
all
things
are
advantageous
All
things
are
lawful
but
not
all
things
build
up
24
Let
each
one
keep
seeking
not
his
own
advantage
but
that
of
the
other
person
25
Eat
whatever
is
sold
in
a
meat
market
making
no
inquiry
because
of
your
conscience
26
for
to
Jehovah
belong
the
earth
and
everything
in
it
27
If
an
unbeliever
invites
you
and
you
want
to
go
eat
whatever
is
set
before
you
making
no
inquiry
on
account
of
your
conscience
28
But
if
anyone
says
to
you
This
is
something
offered
in
sacrifice

do
not
eat
because
of
the
one
who
told
you
and
because
of
conscience
29
I
do
not
mean
your
own
conscience
but
that
of
the
other
person
For
why
should
my
freedom
be
judged
by
another
persons
conscience
30
If
I
am
partaking
with
thanks
why
am
I
to
be
spoken
of
abusively
over
that
for
which
I
give
thanks
31
Therefore
whether
you
are
eating
or
drinking
or
doing
anything
else
do
all
things
for
Gods
glory
32
Keep
from
becoming
causes
for
stumbling
to
Jews
as
well
as
Greeks
and
to
the
congregation
of
God
33
just
as
I
am
trying
to
please
all
people
in
all
things
not
seeking
my
own
advantage
but
that
of
the
many
so
that
they
may
be
saved
1
Become
imitators
of
me
just
as
I
am
of
Christ
2
I
commend
you
because
in
all
things
you
remember
me
and
you
are
holding
fast
the
traditions
just
as
I
handed
them
on
to
you
3
But
I
want
you
to
know
that
the
head
of
every
man
is
the
Christ
in
turn
the
head
of
a
woman
is
the
man
in
turn
the
head
of
the
Christ
is
God
4
Every
man
who
prays
or
prophesies
with
something
on
his
head
shames
his
head
5
but
every
woman
who
prays
or
prophesies
with
her
head
uncovered
shames
her
head
for
it
is
one
and
the
same
as
if
she
were
a
woman
with
a
shaved
head
6
For
if
a
woman
does
not
cover
herself
she
should
have
her
hair
cut
off
but
if
it
is
disgraceful
for
a
woman
to
have
her
hair
cut
off
or
shaved
she
should
be
covered
7
For
a
man
should
not
have
his
head
covered
as
he
is
Gods
image
and
glory
but
the
woman
is
mans
glory
8
For
man
did
not
come
from
woman
but
woman
came
from
man
9
And
what
is
more
man
was
not
created
for
the
sake
of
the
woman
but
woman
for
the
sake
of
the
man
10
That
is
why
the
woman
ought
to
have
a
sign
of
authority
on
her
head
because
of
the
angels
11
Besides
in
connection
with
the
Lord
neither
is
woman
separate
from
man
nor
is
man
separate
from
woman
12
For
just
as
the
woman
is
from
the
man
so
also
the
man
is
through
the
woman
but
all
things
are
from
God
13
Judge
for
yourselves
Is
it
fitting
for
a
woman
to
pray
to
God
with
her
head
uncovered
14
Does
not
nature
itself
teach
you
that
long
hair
is
a
dishonor
to
a
man
15
but
if
a
woman
has
long
hair
it
is
a
glory
to
her
For
her
hair
is
given
to
her
instead
of
a
covering
16
However
if
anyone
wants
to
argue
in
favor
of
some
other
custom
we
have
no
other
nor
do
the
congregations
of
God
17
But
while
giving
these
instructions
I
do
not
commend
you
because
it
is
not
for
the
better
but
for
the
worse
that
you
meet
together
18
For
first
of
all
I
hear
that
when
you
come
together
in
a
congregation
divisions
exist
among
you
and
to
an
extent
I
believe
it
19
For
there
will
certainly
also
be
sects
among
you
so
that
those
of
you
who
are
approved
may
also
become
evident
20
When
you
come
together
in
one
place
it
is
not
really
to
eat
the
Lords
Evening
Meal
21
For
when
you
eat
it
each
one
takes
his
own
evening
meal
beforehand
so
that
one
is
hungry
but
another
is
intoxicated
22
Do
you
not
have
houses
for
eating
and
drinking
Or
do
you
despise
the
congregation
of
God
and
make
those
who
have
nothing
feel
ashamed
What
can
I
say
to
you
Should
I
commend
you
In
this
I
do
not
commend
you
23
For
I
received
from
the
Lord
what
I
also
handed
on
to
you
that
the
Lord
Jesus
on
the
night
on
which
he
was
going
to
be
betrayed
took
a
loaf
24
and
after
giving
thanks
he
broke
it
and
said
This
means
my
body
which
is
in
your
behalf
Keep
doing
this
in
remembrance
of
me
25
He
did
the
same
with
the
cup
also
after
they
had
the
evening
meal
saying
This
cup
means
the
new
covenant
by
virtue
of
my
blood
Keep
doing
this
whenever
you
drink
it
in
remembrance
of
me
26
For
whenever
you
eat
this
loaf
and
drink
this
cup
you
keep
proclaiming
the
death
of
the
Lord
until
he
comes
27
Therefore
whoever
eats
the
loaf
or
drinks
the
cup
of
the
Lord
unworthily
will
be
guilty
respecting
the
body
and
the
blood
of
the
Lord
28
First
let
a
man
approve
himself
after
scrutiny
and
only
then
let
him
eat
of
the
loaf
and
drink
of
the
cup
29
For
the
one
who
eats
and
drinks
without
discerning
the
body
eats
and
drinks
judgment
against
himself
30
That
is
why
many
among
you
are
weak
and
sick
and
quite
a
few
are
sleeping
in
death
31
But
if
we
would
discern
what
we
ourselves
are
we
would
not
be
judged
32
However
when
we
are
judged
we
are
disciplined
by
Jehovah
so
that
we
may
not
become
condemned
with
the
world
33
Consequently
my
brothers
when
you
come
together
to
eat
it
wait
for
one
another
34
If
anyone
is
hungry
let
him
eat
at
home
so
that
when
you
come
together
it
is
not
for
judgment
But
as
for
the
remaining
matters
I
will
put
them
in
order
when
I
get
there
1
Now
concerning
the
spiritual
gifts
brothers
I
do
not
want
you
to
be
uninformed
2
You
know
that
when
you
were
people
of
the
nations
you
were
influenced
and
led
astray
to
those
voiceless
idols
following
wherever
they
might
lead
you
3
Now
I
would
have
you
know
that
nobody
when
speaking
by
Gods
spirit
says
Jesus
is
accursed
and
nobody
can
say
Jesus
is
Lord
except
by
holy
spirit
4
Now
there
are
different
gifts
but
there
is
the
same
spirit
5
and
there
are
different
ministries
and
yet
there
is
the
same
Lord
6
and
there
are
different
activities
and
yet
it
is
the
same
God
who
performs
them
all
in
everyone
7
But
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
is
given
to
each
one
for
a
beneficial
purpose
8
For
to
one
is
given
speech
of
wisdom
through
the
spirit
to
another
speech
of
knowledge
according
to
the
same
spirit
9
to
another
faith
by
the
same
spirit
to
another
gifts
of
healing
by
that
one
spirit
10
to
yet
another
operations
of
powerful
works
to
another
prophesying
to
another
discernment
of
inspired
expressions
to
another
different
tongues
and
to
another
interpretation
of
tongues
11
But
all
these
operations
are
performed
by
the
very
same
spirit
distributing
to
each
one
respectively
just
as
it
wills
12
For
just
as
the
body
is
one
but
has
many
members
and
all
the
members
of
that
body
although
many
are
one
body
so
too
is
the
Christ
13
For
by
one
spirit
we
were
all
baptized
into
one
body
whether
Jews
or
Greeks
whether
slaves
or
free
and
we
were
all
made
to
drink
one
spirit
14
For
indeed
the
body
is
made
up
not
of
one
member
but
of
many
15
If
the
foot
should
say
Because
I
am
not
a
hand
I
am
no
part
of
the
body

that
does
not
make
it
no
part
of
the
body
16
And
if
the
ear
should
say
Because
I
am
not
an
eye
I
am
no
part
of
the
body

that
does
not
make
it
no
part
of
the
body
17
If
the
whole
body
were
an
eye
where
would
the
sense
of
hearing
be
If
it
were
all
hearing
where
would
the
sense
of
smell
be
18
But
now
God
has
arranged
each
of
the
body
members
just
as
he
pleased
19
If
they
were
all
the
same
member
where
would
the
body
be
20
But
now
they
are
many
members
yet
one
body
21
The
eye
cannot
say
to
the
hand
I
do
not
need
you

or
again
the
head
cannot
say
to
the
feet
I
do
not
need
you
22
On
the
contrary
the
members
of
the
body
that
seem
to
be
weaker
are
necessary
23
and
the
parts
of
the
body
that
we
think
to
be
less
honorable
we
surround
with
greater
honor
so
our
unseemly
parts
are
treated
with
greater
modesty
24
whereas
our
attractive
parts
do
not
need
anything
Nevertheless
God
has
so
composed
the
body
giving
greater
honor
to
the
part
that
had
a
lack
25
so
that
there
should
be
no
division
in
the
body
but
its
members
should
have
mutual
concern
for
one
another
26
If
one
member
suffers
all
the
other
members
suffer
with
it
or
if
a
member
is
glorified
all
the
other
members
rejoice
with
it
27
Now
you
are
Christs
body
and
each
of
you
individually
is
a
member
28
And
God
has
assigned
the
respective
ones
in
the
congregation
first
apostles
second
prophets
third
teachers
then
powerful
works
then
gifts
of
healings
helpful
services
abilities
to
direct
different
tongues
29
Not
all
are
apostles
are
they
Not
all
are
prophets
are
they
Not
all
are
teachers
are
they
Not
all
perform
powerful
works
do
they
30
Not
all
have
gifts
of
healings
do
they
Not
all
speak
in
tongues
do
they
Not
all
are
interpreters
are
they
31
But
keep
striving
for
the
greater
gifts
And
yet
I
will
show
you
a
surpassing
way
1
If
I
speak
in
the
tongues
of
men
and
of
angels
but
do
not
have
love
I
have
become
a
clanging
gong
or
a
clashing
cymbal
2
And
if
I
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
understand
all
the
sacred
secrets
and
all
knowledge
and
if
I
have
all
the
faith
so
as
to
move
mountains
but
do
not
have
love
I
am
nothing
3
And
if
I
give
all
my
belongings
to
feed
others
and
if
I
hand
over
my
body
so
that
I
may
boast
but
do
not
have
love
I
do
not
benefit
at
all
4
Love
is
patient
and
kind
Love
is
not
jealous
It
does
not
brag
does
not
get
puffed
up
5
does
not
behave
indecently
does
not
look
for
its
own
interests
does
not
become
provoked
It
does
not
keep
account
of
the
injury
6
It
does
not
rejoice
over
unrighteousness
but
rejoices
with
the
truth
7
It
bears
all
things
believes
all
things
hopes
all
things
endures
all
things
8
Love
never
fails
But
if
there
are
gifts
of
prophecy
they
will
be
done
away
with
if
there
are
tongues
they
will
cease
if
there
is
knowledge
it
will
be
done
away
with
9
For
we
have
partial
knowledge
and
we
prophesy
partially
10
but
when
what
is
complete
comes
what
is
partial
will
be
done
away
with
11
When
I
was
a
child
I
used
to
speak
as
a
child
to
think
as
a
child
to
reason
as
a
child
but
now
that
I
have
become
a
man
I
have
done
away
with
the
traits
of
a
child
12
For
now
we
see
in
hazy
outline
by
means
of
a
metal
mirror
but
then
it
will
be
face-to-face
At
present
I
know
partially
but
then
I
will
know
accurately
just
as
I
am
accurately
known
13
Now
however
these
three
remain
faith
hope
love
but
the
greatest
of
these
is
love
1
Pursue
love
yet
keep
striving
for
the
spiritual
gifts
but
preferably
that
you
may
prophesy
2
For
the
one
who
speaks
in
a
tongue
speaks
not
to
men
but
to
God
for
no
one
listens
but
he
speaks
sacred
secrets
by
the
spirit
3
However
the
one
who
prophesies
builds
up
and
encourages
and
consoles
men
by
his
speech
4
The
one
who
speaks
in
a
tongue
builds
up
himself
but
the
one
who
prophesies
builds
up
a
congregation
5
Now
I
would
like
for
all
of
you
to
speak
in
tongues
but
I
prefer
that
you
prophesy
Indeed
the
one
who
prophesies
is
greater
than
the
one
who
speaks
in
tongues
unless
he
interprets
so
that
the
congregation
may
be
built
up
6
But
at
this
time
brothers
if
I
should
come
speaking
to
you
in
tongues
what
good
would
I
do
you
unless
I
spoke
to
you
either
with
a
revelation
or
with
knowledge
or
with
a
prophecy
or
with
a
teaching
7
It
is
the
same
with
the
inanimate
things
that
produce
sound
whether
a
flute
or
a
harp
Unless
there
is
an
interval
to
the
tones
how
can
what
is
being
played
on
the
flute
or
on
the
harp
be
recognized
8
For
if
the
trumpet
sounds
an
indistinct
call
who
will
get
ready
for
battle
9
In
the
same
way
unless
you
with
the
tongue
use
speech
that
is
easily
understood
how
will
anyone
know
what
is
being
said
You
will
in
fact
be
speaking
into
the
air
10
It
may
be
that
there
are
many
kinds
of
speech
in
the
world
and
yet
no
kind
is
without
meaning
11
For
if
I
do
not
understand
the
sense
of
the
speech
I
will
be
a
foreigner
to
the
one
speaking
and
the
one
speaking
will
be
a
foreigner
to
me
12
So
also
with
you
since
you
eagerly
desire
the
gifts
of
the
spirit
seek
to
abound
in
gifts
that
will
build
up
the
congregation
13
Therefore
let
the
one
who
speaks
in
a
tongue
pray
that
he
may
interpret
14
For
if
I
am
praying
in
a
tongue
it
is
my
gift
of
the
spirit
that
is
praying
but
my
mind
is
unproductive
15
What
is
to
be
done
then
I
will
pray
with
the
gift
of
the
spirit
but
I
will
also
pray
with
my
mind
I
will
sing
praise
with
the
gift
of
the
spirit
but
I
will
also
sing
praise
with
my
mind
16
Otherwise
if
you
offer
praise
with
a
gift
of
the
spirit
how
will
the
ordinary
person
in
your
midst
say
Amen
to
your
giving
of
thanks
since
he
does
not
know
what
you
are
saying
17
True
you
are
giving
thanks
in
a
fine
way
but
the
other
man
is
not
being
built
up
18
I
thank
God
that
I
speak
in
more
tongues
than
all
of
you
do
19
Nevertheless
in
a
congregation
I
would
rather
speak
five
words
with
my
mind
that
I
might
also
instruct
others
than
ten
thousand
words
in
a
tongue
20
Brothers
do
not
become
young
children
in
your
understanding
but
be
young
children
as
to
badness
and
become
full-grown
in
your
understanding
21
In
the
Law
it
is
written
With
the
tongues
of
foreigners
and
with
the
lips
of
strangers
I
will
speak
to
this
people
and
even
then
they
will
refuse
to
listen
to
me

says
Jehovah
22
Therefore
tongues
are
not
a
sign
for
the
believers
but
for
the
unbelievers
whereas
prophecy
is
not
for
the
unbelievers
but
for
the
believers
23
So
if
the
whole
congregation
comes
together
to
one
place
and
they
all
speak
in
tongues
but
ordinary
people
or
unbelievers
come
in
will
they
not
say
that
you
have
lost
your
minds
24
But
if
you
are
all
prophesying
and
an
unbeliever
or
an
ordinary
person
comes
in
he
will
be
reproved
and
closely
examined
by
them
all
25
The
secrets
of
his
heart
then
become
evident
so
that
he
will
fall
facedown
and
worship
God
declaring
God
is
really
among
you
26
What
is
to
be
done
then
brothers
When
you
come
together
one
has
a
psalm
another
has
a
teaching
another
has
a
revelation
another
has
a
tongue
and
another
has
an
interpretation
Let
all
things
take
place
for
building
up
27
And
if
someone
speaks
in
a
tongue
let
it
be
limited
to
two
or
three
at
the
most
and
in
turns
and
someone
must
interpret
28
But
if
there
is
no
interpreter
he
must
keep
silent
in
the
congregation
and
speak
to
himself
and
to
God
29
Let
two
or
three
prophets
speak
and
let
the
others
discern
the
meaning
30
But
if
another
one
receives
a
revelation
while
sitting
there
let
the
first
speaker
keep
silent
31
For
you
can
all
prophesy
one
at
a
time
so
that
all
may
learn
and
all
may
be
encouraged
32
And
gifts
of
the
spirit
of
the
prophets
are
to
be
controlled
by
the
prophets
33
For
God
is
a
God
not
of
disorder
but
of
peace
As
in
all
the
congregations
of
the
holy
ones
34
let
the
women
keep
silent
in
the
congregations
for
it
is
not
permitted
for
them
to
speak
Rather
let
them
be
in
subjection
as
the
Law
also
says
35
If
they
want
to
learn
something
let
them
ask
their
husbands
at
home
for
it
is
disgraceful
for
a
woman
to
speak
in
the
congregation
36
Was
it
from
you
that
the
word
of
God
originated
or
did
it
reach
only
as
far
as
you
37
If
anyone
thinks
he
is
a
prophet
or
is
gifted
with
the
spirit
he
must
acknowledge
that
the
things
I
am
writing
to
you
are
the
Lords
commandment
38
But
if
anyone
disregards
this
he
will
be
disregarded
39
So
my
brothers
keep
striving
to
prophesy
and
yet
do
not
forbid
the
speaking
in
tongues
40
But
let
all
things
take
place
decently
and
by
arrangement
1
Now
I
remind
you
brothers
of
the
good
news
that
I
declared
to
you
which
you
also
accepted
and
for
which
you
have
taken
your
stand
2
Through
it
you
are
also
being
saved
if
you
hold
firmly
to
the
good
news
I
declared
to
you
unless
you
became
believers
for
nothing
3
For
among
the
first
things
I
handed
on
to
you
was
what
I
also
received
that
Christ
died
for
our
sins
according
to
the
Scriptures
4
and
that
he
was
buried
yes
that
he
was
raised
up
on
the
third
day
according
to
the
Scriptures
5
and
that
he
appeared
to
Cephas
and
then
to
the
Twelve
6
After
that
he
appeared
to
more
than
500
brothers
at
one
time
most
of
whom
are
still
with
us
though
some
have
fallen
asleep
in
death
7
After
that
he
appeared
to
James
then
to
all
the
apostles
8
But
last
of
all
he
appeared
also
to
me
as
if
to
one
born
prematurely
9
For
I
am
the
least
of
the
apostles
and
I
am
not
worthy
of
being
called
an
apostle
because
I
persecuted
the
congregation
of
God
10
But
by
Gods
undeserved
kindness
I
am
what
I
am
And
his
undeserved
kindness
to
me
was
not
in
vain
but
I
labored
more
than
all
of
them
yet
it
was
not
I
but
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
that
is
with
me
11
Whether
then
it
is
I
or
they
this
is
the
way
we
preach
and
this
is
the
way
you
believed
12
Now
if
it
is
being
preached
that
Christ
has
been
raised
from
the
dead
how
is
it
that
some
among
you
say
there
is
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
13
If
indeed
there
is
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
then
Christ
has
not
been
raised
up
14
But
if
Christ
has
not
been
raised
up
our
preaching
is
certainly
in
vain
and
your
faith
is
also
in
vain
15
Moreover
we
are
also
found
to
be
false
witnesses
of
God
because
we
have
given
witness
against
God
by
saying
that
he
raised
up
the
Christ
whom
he
did
not
raise
up
if
the
dead
are
really
not
to
be
raised
up
16
For
if
the
dead
are
not
to
be
raised
up
neither
has
Christ
been
raised
up
17
Further
if
Christ
has
not
been
raised
up
your
faith
is
useless
you
remain
in
your
sins
18
Then
also
those
who
have
fallen
asleep
in
death
in
union
with
Christ
have
perished
19
If
in
this
life
only
we
have
hoped
in
Christ
we
are
to
be
pitied
more
than
anyone
20
But
now
Christ
has
been
raised
from
the
dead
the
firstfruits
of
those
who
have
fallen
asleep
in
death
21
For
since
death
came
through
a
man
resurrection
of
the
dead
also
comes
through
a
man
22
For
just
as
in
Adam
all
are
dying
so
also
in
the
Christ
all
will
be
made
alive
23
But
each
one
in
his
own
proper
order
Christ
the
firstfruits
afterward
those
who
belong
to
the
Christ
during
his
presence
24
Next
the
end
when
he
hands
over
the
Kingdom
to
his
God
and
Father
when
he
has
brought
to
nothing
all
government
and
all
authority
and
power
25
For
he
must
rule
as
king
until
God
has
put
all
enemies
under
his
feet
26
And
the
last
enemy
death
is
to
be
brought
to
nothing
27
For
God
subjected
all
things
under
his
feet
But
when
he
says
that
all
things
have
been
subjected

it
is
evident
that
this
does
not
include
the
One
who
subjected
all
things
to
him
28
But
when
all
things
will
have
been
subjected
to
him
then
the
Son
himself
will
also
subject
himself
to
the
One
who
subjected
all
things
to
him
that
God
may
be
all
things
to
everyone
29
Otherwise
what
will
they
do
who
are
being
baptized
for
the
purpose
of
being
dead
ones
If
the
dead
are
not
to
be
raised
up
at
all
why
are
they
also
being
baptized
for
the
purpose
of
being
such
30
Why
are
we
also
in
danger
every
hour
31
Daily
I
face
death
This
is
as
sure
as
my
exultation
over
you
brothers
which
I
have
in
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
32
If
like
other
men
I
have
fought
with
wild
beasts
at
Ephesus
of
what
good
is
it
to
me
If
the
dead
are
not
to
be
raised
up
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
tomorrow
we
are
to
die
33
Do
not
be
misled
Bad
associations
spoil
useful
habits
34
Come
to
your
senses
in
a
righteous
way
and
do
not
practice
sin
for
some
have
no
knowledge
of
God
I
am
speaking
to
move
you
to
shame
35
Nevertheless
someone
will
say
How
are
the
dead
to
be
raised
up
Yes
with
what
sort
of
body
are
they
coming
36
You
unreasonable
person
What
you
sow
is
not
made
alive
unless
first
it
dies
37
And
as
for
what
you
sow
you
sow
not
the
body
that
will
develop
but
just
a
bare
grain
whether
of
wheat
or
of
some
other
kind
of
seed
38
but
God
gives
it
a
body
just
as
it
has
pleased
him
and
gives
to
each
of
the
seeds
its
own
body
39
Not
all
flesh
is
the
same
flesh
but
there
is
one
of
mankind
there
is
another
flesh
of
cattle
another
flesh
of
birds
and
another
of
fish
40
And
there
are
heavenly
bodies
and
earthly
bodies
but
the
glory
of
the
heavenly
bodies
is
one
sort
and
that
of
the
earthly
bodies
is
a
different
sort
41
The
glory
of
the
sun
is
one
sort
and
the
glory
of
the
moon
is
another
and
the
glory
of
the
stars
is
another
in
fact
one
star
differs
from
another
star
in
glory
42
So
it
is
with
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
It
is
sown
in
corruption
it
is
raised
up
in
incorruption
43
It
is
sown
in
dishonor
it
is
raised
up
in
glory
It
is
sown
in
weakness
it
is
raised
up
in
power
44
It
is
sown
a
physical
body
it
is
raised
up
a
spiritual
body
If
there
is
a
physical
body
there
is
also
a
spiritual
one
45
So
it
is
written
The
first
man
Adam
became
a
living
person
The
last
Adam
became
a
life-giving
spirit
46
However
what
is
spiritual
is
not
first
What
is
physical
is
first
and
afterward
what
is
spiritual
47
The
first
man
is
from
the
earth
and
made
of
dust
the
second
man
is
from
heaven
48
Like
the
one
made
of
dust
so
too
are
those
made
of
dust
and
like
the
heavenly
one
so
too
are
those
who
are
heavenly
49
And
just
as
we
have
borne
the
image
of
the
one
made
of
dust
we
will
bear
also
the
image
of
the
heavenly
one
50
But
I
tell
you
this
brothers
that
flesh
and
blood
cannot
inherit
Gods
Kingdom
nor
does
corruption
inherit
incorruption
51
Look
I
tell
you
a
sacred
secret
We
will
not
all
fall
asleep
in
death
but
we
will
all
be
changed
52
in
a
moment
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
during
the
last
trumpet
For
the
trumpet
will
sound
and
the
dead
will
be
raised
up
incorruptible
and
we
will
be
changed
53
For
this
which
is
corruptible
must
put
on
incorruption
and
this
which
is
mortal
must
put
on
immortality
54
But
when
this
which
is
corruptible
puts
on
incorruption
and
this
which
is
mortal
puts
on
immortality
then
the
saying
that
is
written
will
take
place
Death
is
swallowed
up
forever
55
Death
where
is
your
victory
Death
where
is
your
sting
56
The
sting
producing
death
is
sin
and
the
power
for
sin
is
the
Law
57
But
thanks
to
God
for
he
gives
us
the
victory
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
58
Therefore
my
beloved
brothers
be
steadfast
immovable
always
having
plenty
to
do
in
the
work
of
the
Lord
knowing
that
your
labor
is
not
in
vain
in
connection
with
the
Lord
1
Now
concerning
the
collection
for
the
holy
ones
you
may
follow
the
directions
I
gave
to
the
congregations
of
Galatia
2
On
the
first
day
of
every
week
each
of
you
should
set
something
aside
according
to
his
own
means
so
that
collections
will
not
take
place
when
I
arrive
3
But
when
I
get
there
I
will
send
the
men
you
approve
of
in
your
letters
to
take
your
kind
gift
to
Jerusalem
4
However
if
it
seems
advisable
for
me
to
go
there
also
they
will
go
there
with
me
5
But
I
will
come
to
you
when
I
have
gone
through
Macedonia
for
I
will
be
going
through
Macedonia
6
and
perhaps
I
will
stay
or
even
spend
the
winter
with
you
so
that
you
may
accompany
me
partway
to
where
I
may
be
going
7
For
I
do
not
want
to
see
you
now
just
in
passing
since
I
hope
to
spend
some
time
with
you
if
Jehovah
permits
8
But
I
am
remaining
in
Ephesus
until
the
Festival
of
Pentecost
9
because
a
large
door
that
leads
to
activity
has
been
opened
to
me
but
there
are
many
opposers
10
Now
if
Timothy
arrives
make
sure
that
he
has
nothing
to
fear
while
among
you
for
he
is
performing
the
work
of
Jehovah
just
as
I
am
11
Therefore
let
no
one
look
down
on
him
Send
him
on
his
way
in
peace
so
that
he
may
come
to
me
for
I
am
waiting
for
him
together
with
the
brothers
12
Now
concerning
Apollos
our
brother
I
strongly
urged
him
to
come
to
you
with
the
brothers
It
was
not
his
intention
to
come
now
but
he
will
come
when
he
has
the
opportunity
13
Stay
awake
stand
firm
in
the
faith
carry
on
in
a
manly
way
grow
mighty
14
Let
everything
you
do
be
done
with
love
15
Now
I
urge
you
brothers
You
know
that
the
household
of
Stephanas
is
the
firstfruits
of
Achaia
and
that
they
devoted
themselves
to
ministering
to
the
holy
ones
16
May
you
also
keep
submitting
yourselves
to
people
like
that
and
to
all
those
cooperating
and
working
hard
17
But
I
rejoice
over
the
presence
of
Stephanas
and
Fortunatus
and
Achaicus
because
they
have
made
up
for
your
not
being
here
18
For
they
have
refreshed
my
spirit
and
yours
Therefore
give
recognition
to
men
of
that
sort
19
The
congregations
of
Asia
send
you
their
greetings
Aquila
and
Prisca
together
with
the
congregation
that
is
in
their
house
greet
you
heartily
in
the
Lord
20
All
the
brothers
greet
you
Greet
one
another
with
a
holy
kiss
21
Here
is
my
greeting
Pauls
in
my
own
hand
22
If
anyone
has
no
affection
for
the
Lord
let
him
be
accursed
O
our
Lord
come
23
May
the
undeserved
kindness
of
the
Lord
Jesus
be
with
you
24
May
my
love
be
with
all
of
you
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
1
Paul
an
apostle
of
Christ
Jesus
through
Gods
will
and
Timothy
our
brother
to
the
congregation
of
God
that
is
in
Corinth
including
all
the
holy
ones
who
are
in
all
Achaia
2
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
3
Praised
be
the
God
and
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
the
Father
of
tender
mercies
and
the
God
of
all
comfort
4
who
comforts
us
in
all
our
trials
so
that
we
may
be
able
to
comfort
others
in
any
sort
of
trial
with
the
comfort
that
we
receive
from
God
5
For
just
as
the
sufferings
for
the
Christ
abound
in
us
so
the
comfort
we
receive
through
the
Christ
also
abounds
6
Now
if
we
face
trials
it
is
for
your
comfort
and
salvation
and
if
we
are
being
comforted
it
is
for
your
comfort
which
acts
to
help
you
to
endure
the
same
sufferings
that
we
also
suffer
7
And
our
hope
for
you
is
unwavering
knowing
as
we
do
that
just
as
you
share
in
the
sufferings
so
you
will
also
share
in
the
comfort
8
For
we
do
not
want
you
to
be
unaware
brothers
of
the
tribulation
we
experienced
in
the
province
of
Asia
We
were
under
extreme
pressure
beyond
our
own
strength
so
that
we
were
very
uncertain
even
of
our
lives
9
In
fact
we
felt
that
we
had
received
the
sentence
of
death
This
was
so
that
we
would
trust
not
in
ourselves
but
in
the
God
who
raises
up
the
dead
10
From
such
a
great
risk
of
death
he
did
rescue
us
and
will
rescue
us
and
our
hope
is
in
him
that
he
will
also
continue
to
rescue
us
11
You
also
can
help
us
by
your
supplication
for
us
in
order
that
many
may
give
thanks
in
our
behalf
for
the
favor
we
receive
in
answer
to
the
prayers
of
many
12
For
the
thing
we
boast
of
is
this
our
conscience
bears
witness
that
we
have
conducted
ourselves
in
the
world
and
especially
toward
you
with
holiness
and
godly
sincerity
not
with
fleshly
wisdom
but
with
Gods
undeserved
kindness
13
For
we
are
really
not
writing
you
about
anything
except
what
you
can
read
and
understand
and
I
hope
you
will
continue
to
understand
these
things
fully
14
just
as
you
have
also
understood
to
an
extent
that
we
are
a
cause
for
you
to
boast
just
as
you
will
also
be
for
us
in
the
day
of
our
Lord
Jesus
15
So
with
this
confidence
I
was
intending
to
come
first
to
you
so
that
you
might
have
a
second
occasion
for
joy
16
for
I
intended
to
visit
you
on
my
way
to
Macedonia
to
return
to
you
from
Macedonia
and
then
to
have
you
send
me
off
to
Judea
17
Well
when
I
had
such
an
intention
I
did
not
view
the
matter
lightly
did
I
Or
do
I
purpose
things
in
a
fleshly
way
so
that
I
am
saying
Yes
yes
and
then
No
no
18
But
God
can
be
relied
on
that
what
we
say
to
you
is
not
yes
and
yet
no
19
For
the
Son
of
God
Jesus
Christ
who
was
preached
among
you
through
us
that
is
through
me
and
Silvanus
and
Timothy
did
not
become
yes
and
yet
no

but
yes
has
become
yes
in
his
case
20
For
no
matter
how
many
the
promises
of
God
are
they
have
become
yes
by
means
of
him
Therefore
also
through
him
is
the
Amen
said
to
God
which
brings
him
glory
through
us
21
But
the
one
who
guarantees
that
you
and
we
belong
to
Christ
and
the
one
who
anointed
us
is
God
22
He
has
also
put
his
seal
on
us
and
has
given
us
the
token
of
what
is
to
come
that
is
the
spirit
in
our
hearts
23
Now
I
call
on
God
as
a
witness
against
me
that
it
is
to
spare
you
that
I
have
not
yet
come
to
Corinth
24
Not
that
we
are
the
masters
over
your
faith
but
we
are
fellow
workers
for
your
joy
for
it
is
by
your
faith
that
you
are
standing
1
For
I
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
come
to
you
again
in
sadness
2
For
if
I
make
you
sad
who
will
be
there
to
cheer
me
up
except
the
one
I
saddened
3
I
wrote
what
I
did
so
that
when
I
come
I
may
not
be
saddened
by
those
over
whom
I
ought
to
rejoice
because
I
have
confidence
that
what
brings
me
joy
brings
all
of
you
the
same
joy
4
For
out
of
much
tribulation
and
anguish
of
heart
I
wrote
you
with
many
tears
not
to
sadden
you
but
to
let
you
know
the
depth
of
love
I
have
for
you
5
Now
if
anyone
has
caused
sadness
he
has
saddened
not
me
but
all
of
you
to
an
extent—not
to
be
too
harsh
in
what
I
say
6
This
rebuke
given
by
the
majority
is
sufficient
for
such
a
man
7
now
you
should
instead
kindly
forgive
and
comfort
him
so
that
he
may
not
be
overwhelmed
by
excessive
sadness
8
I
therefore
exhort
you
to
confirm
your
love
for
him
9
For
this
is
also
why
I
wrote
to
you
to
determine
whether
you
would
give
proof
of
your
obedience
in
all
things
10
If
you
forgive
anyone
for
anything
I
do
also
In
fact
whatever
I
have
forgiven
if
I
have
forgiven
anything
has
been
for
your
sake
in
Christs
sight
11
so
that
we
may
not
be
overreached
by
Satan
for
we
are
not
ignorant
of
his
designs
12
Now
when
I
arrived
in
Troas
to
declare
the
good
news
about
the
Christ
and
a
door
was
opened
to
me
in
the
Lord
13
my
spirit
felt
no
relief
because
of
not
finding
Titus
my
brother
So
I
said
good-bye
to
them
and
departed
for
Macedonia
14
But
thanks
be
to
God
who
always
leads
us
in
a
triumphal
procession
in
company
with
the
Christ
and
through
us
spreads
the
fragrance
of
the
knowledge
of
him
in
every
place
15
For
to
God
we
are
a
sweet
fragrance
of
Christ
among
those
who
are
being
saved
and
among
those
who
are
perishing
16
to
the
latter
ones
an
odor
of
death
leading
to
death
to
the
former
ones
a
fragrance
of
life
leading
to
life
And
who
is
adequately
qualified
for
these
things
17
We
are
for
we
are
not
peddlers
of
the
word
of
God
as
many
men
are
but
we
speak
in
all
sincerity
as
sent
from
God
yes
in
the
sight
of
God
and
in
company
with
Christ
1
Are
we
starting
to
recommend
ourselves
again
Or
do
we
need
like
some
men
letters
of
recommendation
to
you
or
from
you
2
You
yourselves
are
our
letter
inscribed
on
our
hearts
and
known
and
being
read
by
all
mankind
3
For
you
are
shown
to
be
a
letter
of
Christ
written
by
us
as
ministers
inscribed
not
with
ink
but
with
the
spirit
of
a
living
God
not
on
stone
tablets
but
on
fleshly
tablets
on
hearts
4
We
have
this
sort
of
confidence
toward
God
through
the
Christ
5
Not
that
we
of
ourselves
are
adequately
qualified
to
consider
that
anything
comes
from
us
but
our
being
adequately
qualified
comes
from
God
6
who
has
indeed
adequately
qualified
us
to
be
ministers
of
a
new
covenant
not
of
a
written
code
but
of
spirit
for
the
written
code
condemns
to
death
but
the
spirit
makes
alive
7
Now
if
the
code
that
administers
death
and
that
was
engraved
in
letters
on
stones
came
with
such
glory
that
the
sons
of
Israel
could
not
gaze
at
the
face
of
Moses
because
of
the
glory
of
his
face
a
glory
that
was
to
be
done
away
with
8
why
should
the
administering
of
the
spirit
not
be
with
even
greater
glory
9
For
if
the
code
administering
condemnation
was
glorious
how
much
more
glorious
would
be
the
administering
of
righteousness
10
In
fact
even
what
had
once
been
made
glorious
has
been
stripped
of
glory
because
of
the
glory
that
excels
it
11
For
if
what
was
to
be
done
away
with
was
brought
in
with
glory
how
much
greater
would
be
the
glory
of
what
remains
12
Since
we
have
such
a
hope
we
are
using
great
freeness
of
speech
13
and
not
doing
what
Moses
did
when
he
would
put
a
veil
over
his
face
so
that
the
sons
of
Israel
might
not
gaze
intently
at
the
end
of
what
was
to
be
done
away
with
14
But
their
minds
were
dulled
For
to
this
present
day
the
same
veil
remains
unlifted
when
the
old
covenant
is
read
because
it
is
taken
away
only
by
means
of
Christ
15
In
fact
to
this
day
whenever
Moses
is
read
a
veil
lies
upon
their
hearts
16
But
when
one
turns
to
Jehovah
the
veil
is
taken
away
17
Now
Jehovah
is
the
Spirit
and
where
the
spirit
of
Jehovah
is
there
is
freedom
18
And
all
of
us
while
we
with
unveiled
faces
reflect
like
mirrors
the
glory
of
Jehovah
are
transformed
into
the
same
image
from
one
degree
of
glory
to
another
exactly
as
it
is
done
by
Jehovah
the
Spirit
1
Therefore
since
we
have
this
ministry
through
the
mercy
that
was
shown
us
we
do
not
give
up
2
But
we
have
renounced
the
shameful
underhanded
things
not
walking
with
cunning
or
adulterating
the
word
of
God
but
by
making
the
truth
manifest
we
recommend
ourselves
to
every
human
conscience
in
the
sight
of
God
3
If
in
fact
the
good
news
we
declare
is
veiled
it
is
veiled
among
those
who
are
perishing
4
among
whom
the
god
of
this
system
of
things
has
blinded
the
minds
of
the
unbelievers
so
that
the
illumination
of
the
glorious
good
news
about
the
Christ
who
is
the
image
of
God
might
not
shine
through
5
For
we
are
preaching
not
about
ourselves
but
about
Jesus
Christ
as
Lord
and
ourselves
as
your
slaves
for
Jesus
sake
6
For
God
is
the
one
who
said
Let
the
light
shine
out
of
darkness

and
he
has
shone
on
our
hearts
to
illuminate
them
with
the
glorious
knowledge
of
God
by
the
face
of
Christ
7
However
we
have
this
treasure
in
earthen
vessels
so
that
the
power
beyond
what
is
normal
may
be
Gods
and
not
from
us
8
We
are
hard-pressed
in
every
way
but
not
cramped
beyond
movement
we
are
perplexed
but
not
absolutely
with
no
way
out
9
we
are
persecuted
but
not
abandoned
we
are
knocked
down
but
not
destroyed
10
Always
we
endure
in
our
body
the
death-dealing
treatment
that
Jesus
suffered
that
the
life
of
Jesus
may
also
be
made
manifest
in
our
body
11
For
we
who
live
are
ever
being
brought
face-to-face
with
death
for
Jesus
sake
so
that
the
life
of
Jesus
may
also
be
made
manifest
in
our
mortal
flesh
12
So
death
is
at
work
in
us
but
life
in
you
13
Now
because
we
have
the
same
spirit
of
faith
as
that
of
which
it
is
written
I
exercised
faith
therefore
I
spoke
we
too
exercise
faith
and
therefore
we
speak
14
knowing
that
the
One
who
raised
Jesus
up
will
raise
us
up
also
with
Jesus
and
will
present
us
together
with
you
15
For
all
these
things
are
for
your
sake
so
that
the
increase
of
the
undeserved
kindness
should
abound
even
more
because
many
more
are
offering
thanksgiving
to
the
glory
of
God
16
Therefore
we
do
not
give
up
but
even
if
the
man
we
are
outside
is
wasting
away
certainly
the
man
we
are
inside
is
being
renewed
from
day
to
day
17
For
though
the
tribulation
is
momentary
and
light
it
works
out
for
us
a
glory
that
is
of
more
and
more
surpassing
greatness
and
is
everlasting
18
while
we
keep
our
eyes
not
on
the
things
seen
but
on
the
things
unseen
For
the
things
seen
are
temporary
but
the
things
unseen
are
everlasting
1
For
we
know
that
if
our
earthly
house
this
tent
should
be
torn
down
we
are
to
have
a
building
from
God
a
house
not
made
with
hands
everlasting
in
the
heavens
2
For
in
this
house
we
do
indeed
groan
earnestly
desiring
to
put
on
the
one
for
us
from
heaven
3
so
that
when
we
do
put
it
on
we
will
not
be
found
naked
4
In
fact
we
who
are
in
this
tent
groan
being
weighed
down
because
we
do
not
want
to
put
this
one
off
but
we
want
to
put
the
other
on
so
that
what
is
mortal
may
be
swallowed
up
by
life
5
Now
the
one
who
prepared
us
for
this
very
thing
is
God
who
gave
us
the
spirit
as
a
token
of
what
is
to
come
6
So
we
are
always
of
good
courage
and
know
that
while
we
have
our
home
in
the
body
we
are
absent
from
the
Lord
7
for
we
are
walking
by
faith
not
by
sight
8
But
we
are
of
good
courage
and
would
prefer
to
be
absent
from
the
body
and
to
make
our
home
with
the
Lord
9
So
whether
at
home
with
him
or
absent
from
him
we
make
it
our
aim
to
be
acceptable
to
him
10
For
we
must
all
appear
before
the
judgment
seat
of
the
Christ
so
that
each
one
may
be
repaid
according
to
the
things
he
has
practiced
while
in
the
body
whether
good
or
bad
11
Therefore
since
we
know
the
fear
of
the
Lord
we
keep
persuading
men
but
we
are
well-known
to
God
However
I
hope
that
we
are
well-known
also
to
your
consciences
12
We
are
not
recommending
ourselves
to
you
again
but
giving
you
an
incentive
to
boast
about
us
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
answer
those
who
boast
over
the
outward
appearance
but
not
over
what
is
in
the
heart
13
For
if
we
were
out
of
our
mind
it
was
for
God
if
we
are
sound
in
mind
it
is
for
you
14
For
the
love
the
Christ
has
compels
us
because
this
is
what
we
have
concluded
that
one
man
died
for
all
so
then
all
had
died
15
And
he
died
for
all
so
that
those
who
live
should
live
no
longer
for
themselves
but
for
him
who
died
for
them
and
was
raised
up
16
So
from
now
on
we
know
no
man
from
a
fleshly
viewpoint
Even
if
we
once
knew
Christ
according
to
the
flesh
we
certainly
no
longer
know
him
in
that
way
17
Therefore
if
anyone
is
in
union
with
Christ
he
is
a
new
creation
the
old
things
passed
away
look
new
things
have
come
into
existence
18
But
all
things
are
from
God
who
reconciled
us
to
himself
through
Christ
and
gave
us
the
ministry
of
the
reconciliation
19
namely
that
God
was
by
means
of
Christ
reconciling
a
world
to
himself
not
counting
their
offenses
against
them
and
he
entrusted
to
us
the
message
of
the
reconciliation
20
Therefore
we
are
ambassadors
substituting
for
Christ
as
though
God
were
making
an
appeal
through
us
As
substitutes
for
Christ
we
beg
Become
reconciled
to
God
21
The
one
who
did
not
know
sin
he
made
to
be
sin
for
us
so
that
by
means
of
him
we
might
become
Gods
righteousness
1
Working
together
with
him
we
also
urge
you
not
to
accept
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
and
miss
its
purpose
2
For
he
says
In
an
acceptable
time
I
heard
you
and
in
a
day
of
salvation
I
helped
you
Look
Now
is
the
especially
acceptable
time
Look
Now
is
the
day
of
salvation
3
In
no
way
are
we
giving
any
cause
for
stumbling
so
that
no
fault
may
be
found
with
our
ministry
4
but
in
every
way
we
recommend
ourselves
as
Gods
ministers
by
the
endurance
of
much
by
tribulations
by
times
of
need
by
difficulties
5
by
beatings
by
imprisonments
by
riots
by
hard
work
by
sleepless
nights
by
times
without
food
6
by
purity
by
knowledge
by
patience
by
kindness
by
holy
spirit
by
love
free
from
hypocrisy
7
by
truthful
speech
by
Gods
power
through
the
weapons
of
righteousness
in
the
right
hand
and
in
the
left
8
through
glory
and
dishonor
through
bad
report
and
good
report
We
are
regarded
as
deceivers
and
yet
we
are
truthful
9
as
unknown
and
yet
we
are
recognized
as
dying
and
yet
look
we
live
as
punished
and
yet
not
handed
over
to
death
10
as
sorrowing
but
ever
rejoicing
as
poor
but
making
many
rich
as
having
nothing
and
yet
possessing
all
things
11
We
have
opened
our
mouth
to
speak
to
you
Corinthians
and
we
have
opened
wide
our
heart
12
We
are
not
restricted
in
our
affections
for
you
but
you
are
restricted
in
your
own
tender
affections
for
us
13
So
in
response—I
speak
as
to
my
children—you
too
open
your
hearts
wide
14
Do
not
become
unevenly
yoked
with
unbelievers
For
what
fellowship
do
righteousness
and
lawlessness
have
Or
what
sharing
does
light
have
with
darkness
15
Further
what
harmony
is
there
between
Christ
and
Belial
Or
what
does
a
believer
share
in
common
with
an
unbeliever
16
And
what
agreement
does
Gods
temple
have
with
idols
For
we
are
a
temple
of
a
living
God
just
as
God
said
I
will
reside
among
them
and
walk
among
them
and
I
will
be
their
God
and
they
will
be
my
people
17
Therefore
get
out
from
among
them
and
separate
yourselves

says
Jehovah
and
quit
touching
the
unclean
thing
and
I
will
take
you
in
18
And
I
will
become
a
father
to
you
and
you
will
become
sons
and
daughters
to
me

says
Jehovah
the
Almighty
1
Therefore
since
we
have
these
promises
beloved
ones
let
us
cleanse
ourselves
of
every
defilement
of
flesh
and
spirit
perfecting
holiness
in
the
fear
of
God
2
Make
room
for
us
in
your
hearts
We
have
wronged
no
one
we
have
corrupted
no
one
we
have
taken
advantage
of
no
one
3
I
do
not
say
this
to
condemn
you
For
I
have
said
before
that
you
are
in
our
hearts
to
die
together
and
to
live
together
4
I
have
great
freeness
of
speech
toward
you
I
have
great
boasting
in
regard
to
you
I
am
filled
with
comfort
I
am
overflowing
with
joy
in
all
our
affliction
5
In
fact
when
we
arrived
in
Macedonia
our
bodies
got
no
relief
but
we
continued
to
be
afflicted
in
every
way—there
were
fights
on
the
outside
fears
within
6
But
God
who
comforts
those
who
are
downhearted
comforted
us
by
the
presence
of
Titus
7
and
not
only
by
his
presence
but
also
by
the
comfort
he
received
because
of
you
as
he
reported
back
to
us
about
your
longing
for
me
your
deep
sorrow
and
your
earnest
concern
for
me
so
I
rejoiced
even
more
8
For
even
if
I
saddened
you
by
my
letter
I
do
not
regret
it
Even
if
I
did
at
first
regret
it
seeing
that
the
letter
saddened
you
though
only
for
a
little
while
9
now
I
rejoice
not
because
you
were
just
saddened
but
because
you
were
saddened
into
repenting
For
you
were
saddened
in
a
godly
way
so
that
you
suffered
no
harm
because
of
us
10
For
sadness
in
a
godly
way
produces
repentance
leading
to
salvation
leaving
no
regret
but
the
sadness
of
the
world
produces
death
11
For
see
what
a
great
earnestness
your
being
saddened
in
a
godly
way
produced
in
you
yes
clearing
of
yourselves
yes
indignation
yes
fear
yes
earnest
desire
yes
zeal
yes
righting
of
the
wrong
In
every
respect
you
demonstrated
yourselves
to
be
pure
in
this
matter
12
Although
I
wrote
to
you
I
did
not
do
it
for
the
one
who
did
the
wrong
nor
for
the
one
who
was
wronged
but
so
that
your
earnestness
for
us
might
be
made
evident
among
you
in
the
sight
of
God
13
That
is
why
we
have
been
comforted
But
in
addition
to
our
comfort
we
rejoiced
even
more
over
the
joy
of
Titus
because
all
of
you
refreshed
his
spirit
14
For
if
I
have
boasted
to
him
about
you
I
have
not
been
put
to
shame
but
just
as
all
the
things
we
told
you
were
true
so
also
our
boasting
to
Titus
has
proved
true
15
Also
his
tender
affections
toward
you
are
greater
as
he
remembers
the
obedience
of
all
of
you
how
you
received
him
with
fear
and
trembling
16
I
rejoice
that
in
every
way
I
may
have
confidence
in
you
1
Now
we
want
you
to
know
brothers
about
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
that
has
been
granted
to
the
congregations
of
Macedonia
2
During
a
great
test
under
affliction
their
abundance
of
joy
and
their
deep
poverty
made
the
riches
of
their
generosity
abound
3
For
it
was
according
to
their
means
yes
I
testify
it
was
even
beyond
their
means
4
while
they
on
their
own
initiative
kept
earnestly
begging
us
for
the
privilege
of
kindly
giving
to
have
a
share
in
the
relief
ministry
for
the
holy
ones
5
And
not
merely
as
we
had
hoped
but
first
they
gave
themselves
to
the
Lord
and
to
us
through
Gods
will
6
So
we
encouraged
Titus
that
just
as
he
had
initiated
this
work
among
you
he
should
also
complete
this
same
kind
giving
on
your
part
7
Nevertheless
just
as
you
abound
in
everything
in
faith
and
word
and
knowledge
and
all
earnestness
and
in
our
love
for
you
may
you
also
abound
in
this
kind
giving
8
I
am
saying
this
not
to
command
you
but
to
make
you
aware
of
the
earnestness
of
others
and
to
test
the
genuineness
of
your
love
9
For
you
know
the
undeserved
kindness
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
that
although
he
was
rich
he
became
poor
for
your
sake
so
that
you
might
become
rich
through
his
poverty
10
And
in
this
I
give
my
opinion
This
is
for
your
benefit
seeing
that
already
a
year
ago
you
not
only
initiated
the
action
but
also
showed
your
desire
to
do
it
11
So
now
also
complete
what
you
started
to
do
so
that
your
readiness
to
act
may
be
completed
according
to
the
means
you
have
available
12
For
if
the
readiness
is
there
first
it
is
especially
acceptable
according
to
what
a
person
has
not
according
to
what
a
person
does
not
have
13
For
I
do
not
want
to
make
it
easy
for
others
but
difficult
for
you
14
but
that
by
means
of
an
equalizing
your
surplus
at
the
present
time
might
offset
their
need
so
that
their
surplus
might
also
offset
your
deficiency
that
there
may
be
an
equalizing
15
Just
as
it
is
written
The
person
with
much
did
not
have
too
much
and
the
person
with
little
did
not
have
too
little
16
Now
thanks
be
to
God
for
putting
the
same
earnest
concern
for
you
in
the
heart
of
Titus
17
because
he
has
indeed
responded
to
the
encouragement
but
being
very
eager
he
is
coming
to
you
on
his
own
initiative
18
But
we
are
sending
along
with
him
the
brother
whose
praise
in
connection
with
the
good
news
has
spread
through
all
the
congregations
19
Not
only
that
but
he
was
also
appointed
by
the
congregations
to
be
our
traveling
companion
as
we
administer
this
kind
gift
for
the
glory
of
the
Lord
and
in
proof
of
our
readiness
to
assist
20
Thus
we
are
avoiding
having
any
man
find
fault
with
us
in
connection
with
this
liberal
contribution
that
we
are
administering
21
For
we
care
for
everything
honestly
not
only
in
the
sight
of
Jehovah
but
also
in
the
sight
of
men
22
Moreover
we
are
sending
with
them
our
brother
whom
we
have
often
tested
and
found
to
be
diligent
in
many
matters
but
now
much
more
diligent
on
account
of
his
great
confidence
in
you
23
If
though
there
is
any
question
about
Titus
he
is
my
companion
and
a
fellow
worker
for
your
interests
or
if
there
are
questions
about
our
brothers
they
are
apostles
of
congregations
and
a
glory
of
Christ
24
So
demonstrate
the
proof
of
your
love
to
them
and
show
the
congregations
why
we
boasted
about
you
1
Now
concerning
the
ministry
that
is
for
the
holy
ones
it
is
not
really
necessary
for
me
to
write
you
2
for
I
know
your
willingness
about
which
I
am
boasting
to
the
Macedonians
that
Achaia
has
been
ready
now
for
a
year
and
your
zeal
has
stirred
up
the
majority
of
them
3
But
I
am
sending
the
brothers
so
that
our
boasting
about
you
might
not
prove
empty
in
this
respect
and
that
you
may
really
be
ready
just
as
I
said
you
would
be
4
Otherwise
if
the
Macedonians
should
come
with
me
and
find
you
not
ready
we—not
to
mention
you—should
be
put
to
shame
by
our
confidence
in
you
5
So
I
thought
it
necessary
to
encourage
the
brothers
to
come
to
you
ahead
of
time
and
to
get
your
promised
bountiful
gift
ready
in
advance
so
that
this
might
be
ready
as
a
generous
gift
and
not
as
something
extorted
6
But
as
to
this
whoever
sows
sparingly
will
also
reap
sparingly
and
whoever
sows
bountifully
will
also
reap
bountifully
7
Let
each
one
do
just
as
he
has
resolved
in
his
heart
not
grudgingly
or
under
compulsion
for
God
loves
a
cheerful
giver
8
Moreover
God
is
able
to
cause
all
his
undeserved
kindness
to
abound
toward
you
so
that
you
are
always
completely
self-sufficient
in
everything
as
well
as
having
plenty
for
every
good
work
9
Just
as
it
is
written
He
has
distributed
widely
he
has
given
to
the
poor
His
righteousness
continues
forever
10
Now
the
One
who
abundantly
supplies
seed
to
the
sower
and
bread
for
eating
will
supply
and
multiply
the
seed
for
you
to
sow
and
will
increase
the
harvest
of
your
righteousness
11
In
everything
you
are
being
enriched
for
every
sort
of
generosity
which
produces
through
us
an
expression
of
thanks
to
God
12
because
the
ministry
of
this
public
service
is
not
only
to
provide
well
for
the
needs
of
the
holy
ones
but
also
to
be
rich
in
many
expressions
of
thanks
to
God
13
Through
the
proof
that
this
relief
ministry
gives
they
glorify
God
because
you
are
submissive
to
the
good
news
about
the
Christ
as
you
publicly
declared
and
because
you
are
generous
in
your
contribution
to
them
and
to
all
14
And
with
supplication
for
you
they
express
affection
for
you
because
of
the
surpassing
undeserved
kindness
of
God
upon
you
15
Thanks
be
to
God
for
his
indescribable
free
gift
1
Now
I
myself
Paul
appeal
to
you
by
the
mildness
and
kindness
of
the
Christ
lowly
though
I
am
when
among
you
face-to-face
but
bold
toward
you
when
absent
2
I
beg
that
when
present
I
may
not
have
to
be
bold
and
take
the
strong
measures
that
I
expect
against
some
who
view
us
as
if
we
walked
in
a
fleshly
manner
3
For
though
we
walk
in
the
flesh
we
do
not
wage
warfare
according
to
what
we
are
in
the
flesh
4
For
the
weapons
of
our
warfare
are
not
fleshly
but
powerful
by
God
for
overturning
strongly
entrenched
things
5
For
we
are
overturning
reasonings
and
every
lofty
thing
raised
up
against
the
knowledge
of
God
and
we
are
bringing
every
thought
into
captivity
to
make
it
obedient
to
the
Christ
6
and
we
are
prepared
to
inflict
punishment
for
every
disobedience
as
soon
as
your
own
obedience
is
complete
7
You
look
at
things
according
to
their
face
value
If
anyone
is
confident
in
himself
that
he
belongs
to
Christ
let
him
reflect
again
on
this
fact
Just
as
he
belongs
to
Christ
so
do
we
also
8
For
even
if
I
should
boast
a
bit
too
much
about
the
authority
that
the
Lord
gave
us
to
build
you
up
and
not
to
tear
you
down
I
would
not
be
put
to
shame
9
For
I
do
not
want
to
seem
as
though
I
were
trying
to
terrify
you
by
my
letters
10
For
they
say
His
letters
are
weighty
and
forceful
but
his
presence
in
person
is
weak
and
his
speech
contemptible
11
Let
such
a
man
consider
that
what
we
say
by
letters
when
absent
this
we
will
also
do
when
present
12
For
we
do
not
dare
to
class
ourselves
or
compare
ourselves
with
some
who
recommend
themselves
But
when
they
measure
themselves
by
themselves
and
compare
themselves
with
themselves
they
are
without
understanding
13
However
we
will
not
boast
outside
our
assigned
boundaries
but
within
the
boundary
of
the
territory
that
God
measured
out
to
us
making
it
reach
even
as
far
as
you
14
Really
we
are
not
overextending
ourselves
as
if
we
did
not
reach
you
for
we
were
the
first
to
reach
as
far
as
you
with
the
good
news
about
the
Christ
15
No
we
are
not
boasting
outside
our
assigned
boundaries
about
the
labors
of
someone
else
but
we
hope
that
as
your
faith
continues
to
increase
what
we
have
done
may
be
made
to
increase
within
our
territory
Then
we
will
abound
still
more
16
so
that
we
may
declare
the
good
news
to
the
countries
beyond
you
so
as
not
to
boast
in
what
has
already
been
done
in
someone
elses
territory
17
But
the
one
who
boasts
let
him
boast
in
Jehovah
18
For
it
is
not
the
one
who
recommends
himself
who
is
approved
but
the
one
whom
Jehovah
recommends
1
I
wish
you
would
put
up
with
me
in
a
little
unreasonableness
But
in
fact
you
are
putting
up
with
me
2
For
I
am
jealous
over
you
with
a
godly
jealousy
for
I
personally
promised
you
in
marriage
to
one
husband
that
I
might
present
you
as
a
chaste
virgin
to
the
Christ
3
But
I
am
afraid
that
somehow
as
the
serpent
seduced
Eve
by
its
cunning
your
minds
might
be
corrupted
away
from
the
sincerity
and
the
chastity
that
are
due
the
Christ
4
For
as
it
is
if
someone
comes
and
preaches
a
Jesus
other
than
the
one
we
preached
or
you
receive
a
spirit
other
than
what
you
received
or
good
news
other
than
what
you
accepted
you
easily
put
up
with
him
5
For
I
consider
that
I
have
not
proved
inferior
to
your
superfine
apostles
in
a
single
thing
6
But
even
if
I
am
unskilled
in
speech
I
certainly
am
not
in
knowledge
indeed
we
made
it
clear
to
you
in
every
way
and
in
everything
7
Or
did
I
commit
a
sin
by
humbling
myself
that
you
might
be
exalted
because
I
gladly
declared
the
good
news
of
God
to
you
without
cost
8
Other
congregations
I
deprived
by
accepting
provisions
in
order
to
minister
to
you
9
Yet
when
I
was
present
with
you
and
I
fell
into
need
I
did
not
become
a
burden
on
anyone
for
the
brothers
who
came
from
Macedonia
abundantly
supplied
my
needs
Yes
in
every
way
I
kept
myself
from
becoming
a
burden
to
you
and
will
continue
to
do
so
10
As
surely
as
the
truth
of
Christ
is
in
me
I
will
not
stop
this
boasting
in
the
regions
of
Achaia
11
For
what
reason
Because
I
do
not
love
you
God
knows
I
do
12
But
what
I
am
doing
I
will
continue
to
do
in
order
to
eliminate
the
pretext
of
those
who
are
wanting
a
basis
for
being
found
equal
to
us
in
the
things
about
which
they
boast
13
For
such
men
are
false
apostles
deceitful
workers
disguising
themselves
as
apostles
of
Christ
14
And
no
wonder
for
Satan
himself
keeps
disguising
himself
as
an
angel
of
light
15
It
is
therefore
nothing
extraordinary
if
his
ministers
also
keep
disguising
themselves
as
ministers
of
righteousness
But
their
end
will
be
according
to
their
works
16
I
say
again
Let
no
one
think
I
am
unreasonable
But
even
if
you
do
then
accept
me
as
an
unreasonable
person
so
that
I
too
may
boast
a
little
17
What
I
now
say
is
not
as
following
the
Lords
example
but
as
an
unreasonable
person
would
with
boastful
self-confidence
18
Since
many
are
boasting
according
to
the
flesh
I
too
will
boast
19
Since
you
are
so
reasonable

you
gladly
put
up
with
the
unreasonable
ones
20
In
fact
you
put
up
with
whoever
enslaves
you
whoever
devours
your
possessions
whoever
grabs
what
you
have
whoever
exalts
himself
over
you
and
whoever
strikes
you
in
the
face
21
I
say
this
to
our
dishonor
since
it
may
seem
that
we
have
acted
in
weakness
But
if
others
act
boldly—I
am
talking
unreasonably—I
too
act
boldly
22
Are
they
Hebrews
I
am
one
also
Are
they
Israelites
I
am
one
also
Are
they
Abrahams
offspring
I
am
also
23
Are
they
ministers
of
Christ
I
reply
like
a
madman
I
am
more
outstandingly
one
I
have
done
more
work
been
imprisoned
more
often
suffered
countless
beatings
and
experienced
many
near-deaths
24
Five
times
I
received
40
strokes
less
one
from
the
Jews
25
three
times
I
was
beaten
with
rods
once
I
was
stoned
three
times
I
experienced
shipwreck
a
night
and
a
day
I
have
spent
in
the
open
sea
26
in
journeys
often
in
dangers
from
rivers
in
dangers
from
robbers
in
dangers
from
my
own
people
in
dangers
from
the
nations
in
dangers
in
the
city
in
dangers
in
the
wilderness
in
dangers
at
sea
in
dangers
among
false
brothers
27
in
labor
and
toil
in
sleepless
nights
often
in
hunger
and
thirst
frequently
without
food
in
cold
and
lacking
clothing
28
Besides
those
things
of
an
external
kind
there
is
what
rushes
in
on
me
from
day
to
day
the
anxiety
for
all
the
congregations
29
Who
is
weak
and
I
am
not
weak
Who
is
stumbled
and
I
am
not
incensed
30
If
I
must
boast
I
will
boast
of
the
things
that
show
my
weakness
31
The
God
and
Father
of
the
Lord
Jesus
the
One
who
is
to
be
praised
forever
knows
I
am
not
lying
32
In
Damascus
the
governor
under
Aretas
the
king
was
guarding
the
city
of
the
Damascenes
to
seize
me
33
but
I
was
lowered
in
a
basket
through
a
window
in
the
city
wall
and
I
escaped
his
hands
1
I
have
to
boast
It
is
not
beneficial
but
I
will
move
on
to
supernatural
visions
and
revelations
of
the
Lord
2
I
know
a
man
in
union
with
Christ
who
14
years
ago—whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
I
do
not
know
God
knows—was
caught
away
to
the
third
heaven
3
Yes
I
know
such
a
man—whether
in
the
body
or
apart
from
the
body
I
do
not
know
God
knows—
4
who
was
caught
away
into
paradise
and
heard
words
that
cannot
be
spoken
and
that
are
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
say
5
I
will
boast
about
such
a
man
but
I
will
not
boast
about
myself
except
of
my
weaknesses
6
For
even
if
I
want
to
boast
I
will
not
be
unreasonable
for
I
would
say
the
truth
But
I
refrain
from
doing
so
in
order
that
no
one
should
give
me
more
credit
than
what
he
sees
in
me
or
hears
from
me
7
just
because
of
receiving
such
extraordinary
revelations
To
keep
me
from
becoming
overly
exalted
I
was
given
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
an
angel
of
Satan
to
keep
slapping
me
so
that
I
might
not
be
overly
exalted
8
Three
times
I
begged
the
Lord
about
this
that
it
would
depart
from
me
9
But
he
said
to
me
My
undeserved
kindness
is
sufficient
for
you
for
my
power
is
being
made
perfect
in
weakness
Most
gladly
then
I
will
boast
about
my
weaknesses
in
order
that
the
power
of
the
Christ
may
remain
over
me
like
a
tent
10
So
I
take
pleasure
in
weaknesses
in
insults
in
times
of
need
in
persecutions
and
difficulties
for
Christ
For
when
I
am
weak
then
I
am
powerful
11
I
have
become
unreasonable
You
compelled
me
to
for
I
ought
to
have
been
recommended
by
you
For
I
did
not
prove
to
be
inferior
to
your
superfine
apostles
in
a
single
thing
even
if
I
am
nothing
12
Indeed
the
signs
of
an
apostle
were
produced
among
you
with
great
endurance
and
by
signs
and
wonders
and
powerful
works
13
For
how
were
you
less
favored
than
the
rest
of
the
congregations
except
that
I
myself
did
not
become
a
burden
to
you
Kindly
forgive
me
for
this
wrong
14
Look
This
is
the
third
time
I
am
ready
to
come
to
you
and
I
will
not
become
a
burden
For
I
am
seeking
not
your
possessions
but
you
for
the
children
are
not
expected
to
save
up
for
their
parents
but
the
parents
for
their
children
15
For
my
part
I
will
most
gladly
spend
and
be
completely
spent
for
you
If
I
love
you
so
much
more
am
I
to
be
loved
the
less
16
But
be
that
as
it
may
I
did
not
burden
you
Nevertheless
you
say
I
was
crafty
and
I
caught
you
by
trickery
17
I
did
not
take
advantage
of
you
through
any
of
those
whom
I
sent
to
you
did
I
18
I
urged
Titus
and
I
sent
the
brother
with
him
Titus
did
not
take
advantage
of
you
at
all
did
he
We
walked
in
the
same
spirit
did
we
not
In
the
same
footsteps
did
we
not
19
Have
you
been
thinking
all
along
that
we
have
been
making
our
defense
to
you
It
is
before
God
that
we
are
speaking
in
union
with
Christ
But
beloved
ones
all
that
we
do
is
to
build
you
up
20
For
I
am
afraid
that
somehow
when
I
arrive
I
may
not
find
you
as
I
wish
and
I
may
not
be
as
you
wish
but
instead
there
may
be
strife
jealousy
outbursts
of
anger
dissension
backbiting
whispering
being
puffed
up
with
pride
and
disorder
21
Perhaps
when
I
come
again
my
God
might
humiliate
me
before
you
and
I
may
have
to
mourn
over
many
of
those
who
previously
sinned
but
have
not
repented
of
their
uncleanness
and
sexual
immorality
and
brazen
conduct
that
they
have
practiced
1
This
is
the
third
time
I
am
coming
to
you
On
the
testimony
of
two
or
three
witnesses
every
matter
must
be
established
2
Although
I
am
absent
now
it
is
as
if
I
were
present
for
the
second
time
and
I
give
my
warning
in
advance
to
those
who
sinned
previously
and
to
all
the
rest
that
if
ever
I
come
again
I
will
not
spare
them
3
since
you
are
seeking
proof
that
Christ
who
is
not
weak
toward
you
but
strong
among
you
is
really
speaking
through
me
4
For
indeed
he
was
executed
on
the
stake
because
of
weakness
but
he
is
alive
because
of
Gods
power
True
we
also
are
weak
with
him
but
we
will
live
together
with
him
because
of
Gods
power
toward
you
5
Keep
testing
whether
you
are
in
the
faith
keep
proving
what
you
yourselves
are
Or
do
you
not
recognize
that
Jesus
Christ
is
in
union
with
you
Unless
you
are
disapproved
6
I
truly
hope
you
will
recognize
that
we
are
not
disapproved
7
Now
we
pray
to
God
that
you
may
do
nothing
wrong
not
that
we
may
appear
approved
but
that
you
may
do
what
is
fine
even
if
we
may
appear
disapproved
8
For
we
can
do
nothing
against
the
truth
but
only
for
the
truth
9
We
certainly
rejoice
whenever
we
are
weak
but
you
are
powerful
And
this
is
what
we
are
praying
for
your
being
readjusted
10
That
is
why
I
write
these
things
while
absent
so
that
when
I
am
present
I
may
not
have
to
be
severe
in
using
the
authority
that
the
Lord
gave
me
to
build
up
and
not
to
tear
down
11
Finally
brothers
continue
to
rejoice
to
be
readjusted
to
be
comforted
to
think
in
agreement
to
live
peaceably
and
the
God
of
love
and
of
peace
will
be
with
you
12
Greet
one
another
with
a
holy
kiss
13
All
the
holy
ones
send
you
their
greetings
14
The
undeserved
kindness
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
the
love
of
God
and
the
sharing
in
the
holy
spirit
be
with
all
of
you
1
Paul
an
apostle
neither
from
men
nor
through
a
man
but
through
Jesus
Christ
and
God
the
Father
who
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
2
and
all
the
brothers
with
me
to
the
congregations
of
Galatia
3
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
4
He
gave
himself
for
our
sins
so
that
he
might
rescue
us
from
the
present
wicked
system
of
things
according
to
the
will
of
our
God
and
Father
5
to
whom
be
the
glory
forever
and
ever
Amen
6
I
am
amazed
that
you
are
so
quickly
turning
away
from
the
One
who
called
you
with
Christs
undeserved
kindness
to
another
sort
of
good
news
7
Not
that
there
is
another
good
news
but
there
are
certain
ones
who
are
causing
you
trouble
and
wanting
to
distort
the
good
news
about
the
Christ
8
However
even
if
we
or
an
angel
out
of
heaven
were
to
declare
to
you
as
good
news
something
beyond
the
good
news
we
declared
to
you
let
him
be
accursed
9
As
we
have
said
before
I
now
say
again
Whoever
is
declaring
to
you
as
good
news
something
beyond
what
you
accepted
let
him
be
accursed
10
Is
it
in
fact
men
I
am
now
trying
to
persuade
or
God
Or
am
I
trying
to
please
men
If
I
were
still
pleasing
men
I
would
not
be
Christs
slave
11
For
I
want
you
to
know
brothers
that
the
good
news
I
declared
to
you
is
not
of
human
origin
12
for
neither
did
I
receive
it
from
man
nor
was
I
taught
it
but
it
was
through
a
revelation
by
Jesus
Christ
13
Of
course
you
heard
about
my
conduct
formerly
in
Judaism
that
I
kept
intensely
persecuting
the
congregation
of
God
and
devastating
it
14
and
I
was
making
greater
progress
in
Judaism
than
many
of
my
own
age
in
my
nation
as
I
was
far
more
zealous
for
the
traditions
of
my
fathers
15
But
when
God
who
separated
me
from
my
mothers
womb
and
called
me
through
his
undeserved
kindness
thought
good
16
to
reveal
his
Son
through
me
so
that
I
might
declare
the
good
news
about
him
to
the
nations
I
did
not
immediately
consult
with
any
human
17
nor
did
I
go
up
to
Jerusalem
to
those
who
were
apostles
before
I
was
but
I
went
to
Arabia
and
then
I
returned
to
Damascus
18
Then
three
years
later
I
went
up
to
Jerusalem
to
visit
Cephas
and
I
stayed
with
him
for
15
days
19
But
I
did
not
see
any
of
the
other
apostles
only
James
the
brother
of
the
Lord
20
Now
regarding
the
things
I
am
writing
you
I
assure
you
before
God
that
I
am
not
lying
21
After
that
I
went
into
the
regions
of
Syria
and
Cilicia
22
But
I
was
personally
unknown
to
the
congregations
of
Judea
that
were
in
union
with
Christ
23
They
only
used
to
hear
The
man
who
formerly
persecuted
us
is
now
declaring
the
good
news
about
the
faith
that
he
formerly
devastated
24
So
they
began
glorifying
God
because
of
me
1
Then
after
14
years
I
again
went
up
to
Jerusalem
with
Barnabas
also
taking
Titus
along
with
me
2
I
went
up
as
a
result
of
a
revelation
and
I
presented
to
them
the
good
news
that
I
am
preaching
among
the
nations
This
was
done
privately
however
before
the
men
who
were
highly
regarded
to
make
sure
that
I
was
not
running
or
had
not
run
in
vain
3
Nevertheless
not
even
Titus
who
was
with
me
was
compelled
to
be
circumcised
although
he
was
a
Greek
4
But
that
matter
came
up
because
of
the
false
brothers
brought
in
quietly
who
slipped
in
to
spy
on
the
freedom
we
enjoy
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
so
that
they
might
completely
enslave
us
5
we
did
not
yield
in
submission
to
them
no
not
for
a
moment
so
that
the
truth
of
the
good
news
might
continue
with
you
6
But
regarding
those
who
seemed
to
be
important—whatever
they
were
makes
no
difference
to
me
for
God
does
not
go
by
a
mans
outward
appearance—those
highly
regarded
men
imparted
nothing
new
to
me
7
On
the
contrary
when
they
saw
that
I
had
been
entrusted
with
the
good
news
for
those
who
are
uncircumcised
just
as
Peter
had
been
for
those
who
are
circumcised—
8
for
the
one
who
empowered
Peter
for
an
apostleship
to
those
who
are
circumcised
also
empowered
me
for
those
who
are
of
the
nations—
9
and
when
they
recognized
the
undeserved
kindness
that
was
given
me
James
and
Cephas
and
John
the
ones
who
seemed
to
be
pillars
gave
Barnabas
and
me
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
so
that
we
should
go
to
the
nations
but
they
to
those
who
are
circumcised
10
They
asked
only
that
we
keep
the
poor
in
mind
and
this
I
have
also
earnestly
endeavored
to
do
11
However
when
Cephas
came
to
Antioch
I
resisted
him
face-to-face
because
he
was
clearly
in
the
wrong
12
For
before
certain
men
from
James
arrived
he
used
to
eat
with
people
of
the
nations
but
when
they
arrived
he
stopped
doing
this
and
separated
himself
fearing
those
of
the
circumcised
class
13
The
rest
of
the
Jews
also
joined
him
in
putting
on
this
pretense
so
that
even
Barnabas
was
led
along
with
them
in
their
pretense
14
But
when
I
saw
that
they
were
not
walking
in
step
with
the
truth
of
the
good
news
I
said
to
Cephas
before
them
all
If
you
though
you
are
a
Jew
live
as
the
nations
do
and
not
as
Jews
do
how
can
you
compel
people
of
the
nations
to
live
according
to
Jewish
practice
15
We
who
are
Jews
by
birth
and
not
sinners
from
the
nations
16
recognize
that
a
man
is
declared
righteous
not
by
works
of
law
but
only
through
faith
in
Jesus
Christ
So
we
have
put
our
faith
in
Christ
Jesus
so
that
we
may
be
declared
righteous
by
faith
in
Christ
and
not
by
works
of
law
for
no
one
will
be
declared
righteous
by
works
of
law
17
Now
if
we
have
also
been
found
sinners
while
seeking
to
be
declared
righteous
by
means
of
Christ
is
Christ
then
sins
minister
Certainly
not
18
If
the
very
things
that
I
once
tore
down
I
build
up
again
I
demonstrate
that
I
am
a
transgressor
19
For
through
law
I
died
toward
law
so
that
I
might
become
alive
toward
God
20
I
am
nailed
to
the
stake
along
with
Christ
It
is
no
longer
I
who
live
but
it
is
Christ
who
is
living
in
union
with
me
Indeed
the
life
that
I
now
live
in
the
flesh
I
live
by
faith
in
the
Son
of
God
who
loved
me
and
handed
himself
over
for
me
21
I
do
not
reject
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
for
if
righteousness
is
through
law
Christ
actually
died
for
nothing
1
O
senseless
Galatians
Who
has
brought
you
under
this
evil
influence
you
who
had
Jesus
Christ
openly
portrayed
before
you
as
nailed
to
the
stake
2
This
one
thing
I
want
to
ask
you
Did
you
receive
the
spirit
through
works
of
law
or
because
of
faith
in
what
you
heard
3
Are
you
so
senseless
After
starting
on
a
spiritual
course
are
you
finishing
on
a
fleshly
course
4
Did
you
undergo
so
many
sufferings
for
nothing
If
it
really
was
for
nothing
5
Therefore
does
the
one
who
supplies
you
the
spirit
and
performs
powerful
works
among
you
do
it
because
of
your
works
of
law
or
because
of
your
faith
in
what
you
heard
6
Just
as
Abraham
put
faith
in
Jehovah
and
it
was
counted
to
him
as
righteousness
7
Surely
you
know
that
it
is
those
who
adhere
to
faith
who
are
sons
of
Abraham
8
Now
the
scripture
foreseeing
that
God
would
declare
people
of
the
nations
righteous
through
faith
declared
the
good
news
beforehand
to
Abraham
namely
By
means
of
you
all
the
nations
will
be
blessed
9
So
those
who
adhere
to
faith
are
being
blessed
together
with
Abraham
who
had
faith
10
All
those
who
depend
on
works
of
law
are
under
a
curse
for
it
is
written
Cursed
is
everyone
who
does
not
remain
in
all
the
things
written
in
the
scroll
of
the
Law
by
doing
them
11
Moreover
it
is
evident
that
by
law
no
one
is
declared
righteous
with
God
because
the
righteous
one
will
live
by
reason
of
faith
12
Now
the
Law
is
not
based
on
faith
Rather
anyone
who
does
these
things
will
live
by
means
of
them
13
Christ
purchased
us
releasing
us
from
the
curse
of
the
Law
by
becoming
a
curse
instead
of
us
because
it
is
written
Accursed
is
every
man
hung
upon
a
stake
14
This
was
so
that
the
blessing
of
Abraham
would
come
to
the
nations
by
means
of
Christ
Jesus
so
that
we
might
receive
the
promised
spirit
through
our
faith
15
Brothers
I
speak
using
a
human
illustration
Once
a
covenant
is
validated
even
if
only
by
a
man
no
one
annuls
it
or
attaches
additions
to
it
16
Now
the
promises
were
spoken
to
Abraham
and
to
his
offspring
It
does
not
say
and
to
your
descendants

in
the
sense
of
many
Rather
it
says
and
to
your
offspring

in
the
sense
of
one
who
is
Christ
17
Further
I
say
this
The
Law
which
came
into
being
430
years
later
does
not
invalidate
the
covenant
previously
made
by
God
so
as
to
abolish
the
promise
18
For
if
the
inheritance
is
based
on
law
it
is
no
longer
based
on
a
promise
but
God
has
kindly
given
it
to
Abraham
through
a
promise
19
Why
then
the
Law
It
was
added
to
make
transgressions
manifest
until
the
offspring
should
arrive
to
whom
the
promise
had
been
made
and
it
was
transmitted
through
angels
by
the
hand
of
a
mediator
20
Now
there
is
no
mediator
when
just
one
person
is
involved
but
God
is
only
one
21
Is
the
Law
therefore
against
the
promises
of
God
Certainly
not
For
if
a
law
had
been
given
that
could
give
life
righteousness
would
actually
have
been
by
means
of
law
22
But
the
Scripture
handed
all
things
over
to
the
custody
of
sin
so
that
the
promise
resulting
from
faith
in
Jesus
Christ
might
be
given
to
those
exercising
faith
23
However
before
the
faith
arrived
we
were
being
guarded
under
law
being
handed
over
into
custody
looking
to
the
faith
that
was
about
to
be
revealed
24
So
the
Law
became
our
guardian
leading
to
Christ
so
that
we
might
be
declared
righteous
through
faith
25
But
now
that
the
faith
has
arrived
we
are
no
longer
under
a
guardian
26
You
are
all
in
fact
sons
of
God
through
your
faith
in
Christ
Jesus
27
For
all
of
you
who
were
baptized
into
Christ
have
put
on
Christ
28
There
is
neither
Jew
nor
Greek
there
is
neither
slave
nor
freeman
there
is
neither
male
nor
female
for
you
are
all
one
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
29
Moreover
if
you
belong
to
Christ
you
are
really
Abrahams
offspring
heirs
with
reference
to
a
promise
1
Now
I
say
that
as
long
as
the
heir
is
a
young
child
he
is
no
different
from
a
slave
although
he
is
the
lord
of
all
things
2
but
he
is
under
supervisors
and
stewards
until
the
day
set
ahead
of
time
by
his
father
3
Likewise
we
too
when
we
were
children
were
enslaved
by
the
elementary
things
of
the
world
4
But
when
the
full
limit
of
the
time
arrived
God
sent
his
Son
who
was
born
of
a
woman
and
who
was
under
law
5
that
he
might
release
by
purchase
those
under
law
so
that
we
might
receive
the
adoption
as
sons
6
Now
because
you
are
sons
God
has
sent
the
spirit
of
his
Son
into
our
hearts
and
it
cries
out
Abba
Father
7
So
you
are
no
longer
a
slave
but
a
son
and
if
a
son
then
you
are
also
an
heir
through
God
8
Nevertheless
when
you
did
not
know
God
you
were
enslaved
to
those
who
are
not
really
gods
9
But
now
that
you
have
come
to
know
God
or
rather
have
come
to
be
known
by
God
how
is
it
that
you
are
turning
back
again
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elementary
things
and
want
to
slave
for
them
over
again
10
You
are
scrupulously
observing
days
and
months
and
seasons
and
years
11
I
fear
for
you
that
somehow
I
have
wasted
my
efforts
on
you
12
Brothers
I
beg
you
become
as
I
am
because
I
also
used
to
be
as
you
are
You
did
me
no
wrong
13
But
you
know
that
it
was
because
of
a
physical
illness
that
I
had
my
first
opportunity
to
declare
the
good
news
to
you
14
And
though
my
physical
condition
was
a
trial
for
you
you
did
not
treat
me
with
contempt
or
disgust
but
you
received
me
like
an
angel
of
God
like
Christ
Jesus
15
Where
is
that
happiness
you
had
For
I
bear
you
witness
that
if
it
had
been
possible
you
would
have
gouged
out
your
eyes
and
given
them
to
me
16
So
then
have
I
become
your
enemy
because
I
tell
you
the
truth
17
They
are
zealous
to
win
you
over
but
not
for
a
good
purpose
they
want
to
alienate
you
from
me
so
that
you
may
be
eager
to
follow
them
18
However
it
is
always
fine
for
someone
to
seek
zealously
after
you
for
a
good
purpose
and
not
just
when
I
am
present
with
you
19
my
little
children
for
whom
I
am
again
experiencing
birth
pains
until
Christ
is
formed
in
you
20
I
wish
I
could
be
present
with
you
just
now
and
speak
in
a
different
way
because
I
am
perplexed
over
you
21
Tell
me
you
who
want
to
be
under
law
Do
you
not
hear
the
Law
22
For
example
it
is
written
that
Abraham
had
two
sons
one
by
the
servant
girl
and
one
by
the
free
woman
23
but
the
one
by
the
servant
girl
was
actually
born
through
natural
descent
and
the
other
by
the
free
woman
through
a
promise
24
These
things
may
be
taken
as
a
symbolic
drama
for
these
women
mean
two
covenants
the
one
from
Mount
Sinai
which
bears
children
for
slavery
and
which
is
Hagar
25
Now
Hagar
means
Sinai
a
mountain
in
Arabia
and
she
corresponds
with
the
Jerusalem
today
for
she
is
in
slavery
with
her
children
26
But
the
Jerusalem
above
is
free
and
she
is
our
mother
27
For
it
is
written
Be
glad
you
barren
woman
who
does
not
give
birth
break
into
joyful
shouting
you
woman
who
does
not
have
birth
pains
for
the
children
of
the
desolate
woman
are
more
numerous
than
those
of
her
who
has
the
husband
28
Now
you
brothers
are
children
of
the
promise
the
same
as
Isaac
was
29
But
just
as
then
the
one
born
through
natural
descent
began
persecuting
the
one
born
through
spirit
so
also
now
30
Nevertheless
what
does
the
scripture
say
Drive
out
the
servant
girl
and
her
son
for
the
son
of
the
servant
girl
will
by
no
means
be
an
heir
with
the
son
of
the
free
woman
31
So
brothers
we
are
children
not
of
a
servant
girl
but
of
the
free
woman
1
For
such
freedom
Christ
set
us
free
Therefore
stand
firm
and
do
not
let
yourselves
be
confined
again
in
a
yoke
of
slavery
2
See
I
Paul
am
telling
you
that
if
you
become
circumcised
Christ
will
be
of
no
benefit
to
you
3
Again
I
bear
witness
to
every
man
who
gets
circumcised
that
he
is
under
obligation
to
keep
the
whole
Law
4
You
are
separated
from
Christ
you
who
are
trying
to
be
declared
righteous
by
means
of
law
you
have
fallen
away
from
his
undeserved
kindness
5
For
our
part
we
are
by
spirit
eagerly
waiting
for
the
hoped-for
righteousness
resulting
from
faith
6
For
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
is
of
any
value
but
faith
operating
through
love
is
7
You
were
running
well
Who
hindered
you
from
continuing
to
obey
the
truth
8
This
sort
of
persuasion
does
not
come
from
the
One
calling
you
9
A
little
leaven
ferments
the
whole
batch
of
dough
10
I
am
confident
that
you
who
are
in
union
with
the
Lord
will
not
come
to
think
otherwise
but
the
one
who
is
causing
you
trouble
whoever
he
may
be
will
receive
the
judgment
he
deserves
11
As
for
me
brothers
if
I
am
still
preaching
circumcision
why
am
I
still
being
persecuted
In
that
case
the
stumbling
block
of
the
torture
stake
has
been
eliminated
12
I
wish
the
men
who
are
trying
to
unsettle
you
would
emasculate
themselves
13
You
were
called
to
freedom
brothers
only
do
not
use
this
freedom
as
an
opportunity
to
pursue
fleshly
desires
but
through
love
slave
for
one
another
14
For
the
entire
Law
has
been
fulfilled
in
one
commandment
namely
You
must
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
15
If
though
you
keep
on
biting
and
devouring
one
another
look
out
that
you
do
not
get
annihilated
by
one
another
16
But
I
say
Keep
walking
by
spirit
and
you
will
carry
out
no
fleshly
desire
at
all
17
For
the
flesh
is
against
the
spirit
in
its
desire
and
the
spirit
against
the
flesh
these
are
opposed
to
each
other
so
that
you
do
not
do
the
very
things
you
want
to
do
18
Furthermore
if
you
are
being
led
by
spirit
you
are
not
under
law
19
Now
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
plainly
seen
and
they
are
sexual
immorality
uncleanness
brazen
conduct
20
idolatry
spiritism
hostility
strife
jealousy
fits
of
anger
dissensions
divisions
sects
21
envy
drunkenness
wild
parties
and
things
like
these
I
am
forewarning
you
about
these
things
the
same
way
I
already
warned
you
that
those
who
practice
such
things
will
not
inherit
Gods
Kingdom
22
On
the
other
hand
the
fruitage
of
the
spirit
is
love
joy
peace
patience
kindness
goodness
faith
23
mildness
self-control
Against
such
things
there
is
no
law
24
Moreover
those
who
belong
to
Christ
Jesus
have
nailed
to
the
stake
the
flesh
together
with
its
passions
and
desires
25
If
we
are
living
by
spirit
let
us
also
go
on
walking
orderly
by
spirit
26
Let
us
not
become
egotistical
stirring
up
competition
with
one
another
envying
one
another
1
Brothers
even
if
a
man
takes
a
false
step
before
he
is
aware
of
it
you
who
have
spiritual
qualifications
try
to
readjust
such
a
man
in
a
spirit
of
mildness
But
keep
an
eye
on
yourself
for
fear
you
too
may
be
tempted
2
Go
on
carrying
the
burdens
of
one
another
and
in
this
way
you
will
fulfill
the
law
of
the
Christ
3
For
if
anyone
thinks
he
is
something
when
he
is
nothing
he
is
deceiving
himself
4
But
let
each
one
examine
his
own
actions
and
then
he
will
have
cause
for
rejoicing
in
regard
to
himself
alone
and
not
in
comparison
with
the
other
person
5
For
each
one
will
carry
his
own
load
6
Moreover
let
anyone
who
is
being
taught
the
word
share
in
all
good
things
with
the
one
who
gives
such
teaching
7
Do
not
be
misled
God
is
not
one
to
be
mocked
For
whatever
a
person
is
sowing
this
he
will
also
reap
8
because
the
one
sowing
with
a
view
to
his
flesh
will
reap
corruption
from
his
flesh
but
the
one
sowing
with
a
view
to
the
spirit
will
reap
everlasting
life
from
the
spirit
9
So
let
us
not
give
up
in
doing
what
is
fine
for
in
due
time
we
will
reap
if
we
do
not
tire
out
10
So
then
as
long
as
we
have
the
opportunity
let
us
work
what
is
good
toward
all
but
especially
toward
those
related
to
us
in
the
faith
11
See
with
what
large
letters
I
have
written
you
with
my
own
hand
12
All
those
who
want
to
make
a
good
impression
in
the
flesh
are
the
ones
who
try
to
compel
you
to
get
circumcised
doing
so
only
to
avoid
being
persecuted
for
the
torture
stake
of
the
Christ
13
For
even
those
who
are
getting
circumcised
do
not
keep
the
Law
themselves
but
they
want
you
to
be
circumcised
so
that
they
may
have
cause
for
boasting
about
your
flesh
14
But
may
I
never
boast
except
in
the
torture
stake
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
the
world
has
been
put
to
death
with
regard
to
me
and
I
with
regard
to
the
world
15
For
neither
is
circumcision
anything
nor
is
uncircumcision
but
a
new
creation
is
16
As
for
all
those
who
walk
orderly
by
this
rule
of
conduct
peace
and
mercy
be
upon
them
yes
upon
the
Israel
of
God
17
From
now
on
let
no
one
make
trouble
for
me
for
I
am
bearing
on
my
body
the
brand
marks
of
a
slave
of
Jesus
18
The
undeserved
kindness
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
the
spirit
you
show
brothers
Amen
1
Paul
an
apostle
of
Christ
Jesus
through
Gods
will
to
the
holy
ones
who
are
in
Ephesus
and
are
faithful
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
2
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
3
Praised
be
the
God
and
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
for
he
has
blessed
us
with
every
spiritual
blessing
in
the
heavenly
places
in
union
with
Christ
4
as
he
chose
us
to
be
in
union
with
him
before
the
founding
of
the
world
that
we
should
be
holy
and
unblemished
before
him
in
love
5
For
he
foreordained
us
to
be
adopted
as
his
own
sons
through
Jesus
Christ
according
to
his
good
pleasure
and
will
6
in
praise
of
his
glorious
undeserved
kindness
that
he
kindly
bestowed
on
us
by
means
of
his
beloved
one
7
By
means
of
him
we
have
the
release
by
ransom
through
the
blood
of
that
one
yes
the
forgiveness
of
our
trespasses
according
to
the
riches
of
his
undeserved
kindness
8
This
undeserved
kindness
he
caused
to
abound
toward
us
in
all
wisdom
and
understanding
9
by
making
known
to
us
the
sacred
secret
of
his
will
It
is
according
to
his
good
pleasure
that
he
himself
purposed
10
for
an
administration
at
the
full
limit
of
the
appointed
times
to
gather
all
things
together
in
the
Christ
the
things
in
the
heavens
and
the
things
on
the
earth
Yes
in
him
11
with
whom
we
are
in
union
and
were
assigned
as
heirs
having
been
foreordained
according
to
the
purpose
of
the
one
who
accomplishes
all
things
as
he
decides
according
to
his
will
12
so
that
we
who
have
been
first
to
hope
in
the
Christ
should
serve
for
the
praise
of
his
glory
13
But
you
also
hoped
in
him
after
you
heard
the
word
of
truth
the
good
news
about
your
salvation
After
you
believed
you
were
sealed
by
means
of
him
with
the
promised
holy
spirit
14
which
is
a
token
in
advance
of
our
inheritance
for
the
purpose
of
releasing
Gods
own
possession
by
a
ransom
to
his
glorious
praise
15
That
is
why
I
also
since
I
have
heard
of
the
faith
that
you
have
in
the
Lord
Jesus
and
the
love
that
you
demonstrate
toward
all
the
holy
ones
16
never
stop
giving
thanks
for
you
I
continue
mentioning
you
in
my
prayers
17
that
the
God
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
the
Father
of
glory
may
give
you
a
spirit
of
wisdom
and
of
revelation
in
the
accurate
knowledge
of
him
18
He
has
enlightened
the
eyes
of
your
heart
so
that
you
may
know
to
what
hope
he
called
you
what
glorious
riches
he
holds
as
an
inheritance
for
the
holy
ones
19
and
how
surpassing
the
greatness
of
his
power
is
toward
us
believers
It
is
according
to
the
operation
of
the
mightiness
of
his
strength
20
which
he
exercised
toward
Christ
when
he
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
and
seated
him
at
his
right
hand
in
the
heavenly
places
21
far
above
every
government
and
authority
and
power
and
lordship
and
every
name
that
is
named
not
only
in
this
system
of
things
but
also
in
that
to
come
22
He
also
subjected
all
things
under
his
feet
and
made
him
head
over
all
things
with
regard
to
the
congregation
23
which
is
his
body
the
fullness
of
him
who
fills
up
all
things
in
all
1
Furthermore
God
made
you
alive
though
you
were
dead
in
your
trespasses
and
sins
2
in
which
you
at
one
time
walked
according
to
the
system
of
things
of
this
world
according
to
the
ruler
of
the
authority
of
the
air
the
spirit
that
is
now
at
work
in
the
sons
of
disobedience
3
Yes
among
them
we
all
at
one
time
conducted
ourselves
in
harmony
with
the
desires
of
our
flesh
carrying
out
the
will
of
the
flesh
and
of
our
thoughts
and
we
were
naturally
children
of
wrath
just
as
the
rest
4
But
God
being
rich
in
mercy
because
of
his
great
love
with
which
he
loved
us
5
made
us
alive
together
with
the
Christ
even
when
we
were
dead
in
trespasses—by
undeserved
kindness
you
have
been
saved
6
Moreover
he
raised
us
up
together
and
seated
us
together
in
the
heavenly
places
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
7
so
that
in
the
coming
systems
of
things
he
might
demonstrate
the
surpassing
riches
of
his
undeserved
kindness
in
his
graciousness
toward
us
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
8
By
this
undeserved
kindness
you
have
been
saved
through
faith
and
this
is
not
of
your
own
doing
rather
it
is
Gods
gift
9
No
it
is
not
a
result
of
works
so
that
no
one
should
have
grounds
for
boasting
10
We
are
Gods
handiwork
and
were
created
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
for
good
works
which
God
determined
in
advance
for
us
to
walk
in
them
11
Therefore
remember
that
at
one
time
you
people
of
the
nations
by
fleshly
descent
were
the
ones
called
uncircumcision
by
those
called
circumcision

which
is
made
in
the
flesh
by
human
hands
12
At
that
time
you
were
without
Christ
alienated
from
the
state
of
Israel
strangers
to
the
covenants
of
the
promise
you
had
no
hope
and
were
without
God
in
the
world
13
But
now
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
you
who
were
once
far
off
have
come
to
be
near
by
the
blood
of
the
Christ
14
For
he
is
our
peace
the
one
who
made
the
two
groups
one
and
destroyed
the
wall
in
between
that
fenced
them
off
15
By
means
of
his
flesh
he
abolished
the
enmity
the
Law
of
commandments
consisting
in
decrees
in
order
to
make
the
two
groups
in
union
with
himself
into
one
new
man
and
to
make
peace
16
and
to
reconcile
fully
both
peoples
in
one
body
to
God
through
the
torture
stake
because
he
had
killed
off
the
enmity
by
means
of
himself
17
And
he
came
and
declared
the
good
news
of
peace
to
you
who
were
far
off
and
peace
to
those
near
18
because
through
him
we
both
peoples
have
free
access
to
the
Father
by
one
spirit
19
So
you
are
no
longer
strangers
and
foreigners
but
you
are
fellow
citizens
of
the
holy
ones
and
are
members
of
the
household
of
God
20
and
you
have
been
built
up
on
the
foundation
of
the
apostles
and
prophets
while
Christ
Jesus
himself
is
the
foundation
cornerstone
21
In
union
with
him
the
whole
building
being
harmoniously
joined
together
is
growing
into
a
holy
temple
for
Jehovah
22
In
union
with
him
you
too
are
being
built
up
together
into
a
place
for
God
to
inhabit
by
spirit
1
For
this
reason
I
Paul
the
prisoner
of
Christ
Jesus
in
behalf
of
you
the
people
of
the
nations—
2
if
really
you
have
heard
about
the
stewardship
of
Gods
undeserved
kindness
that
was
given
to
me
for
your
sakes
3
that
by
way
of
a
revelation
the
sacred
secret
was
made
known
to
me
just
as
I
wrote
previously
in
brief
4
So
when
you
read
this
you
can
realize
my
comprehension
of
the
sacred
secret
of
the
Christ
5
In
other
generations
this
secret
was
not
made
known
to
the
sons
of
men
as
it
has
now
been
revealed
to
his
holy
apostles
and
prophets
by
spirit
6
namely
that
people
of
the
nations
should
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
and
through
the
good
news
be
joint
heirs
and
fellow
members
of
the
body
and
partakers
with
us
of
the
promise
7
I
became
a
minister
of
this
according
to
the
free
gift
of
Gods
undeserved
kindness
that
was
given
me
through
the
operation
of
his
power
8
To
me
a
man
less
than
the
least
of
all
holy
ones
this
undeserved
kindness
was
given
so
that
I
should
declare
to
the
nations
the
good
news
about
the
unfathomable
riches
of
the
Christ
9
and
should
make
everyone
see
the
administration
of
the
sacred
secret
that
has
been
hidden
through
the
ages
in
God
who
created
all
things
10
This
was
so
that
now
through
the
congregation
there
might
be
made
known
to
the
governments
and
the
authorities
in
the
heavenly
places
the
greatly
diversified
wisdom
of
God
11
This
is
according
to
the
eternal
purpose
that
he
formed
in
connection
with
the
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
12
by
means
of
whom
we
have
this
freeness
of
speech
and
free
access
with
confidence
through
our
faith
in
him
13
So
I
ask
you
not
to
give
up
on
account
of
my
tribulations
in
your
behalf
for
these
mean
glory
for
you
14
For
this
reason
I
bend
my
knees
to
the
Father
15
to
whom
every
family
in
heaven
and
on
earth
owes
its
name
16
I
pray
that
he
may
grant
you
through
the
abundance
of
his
glory
to
be
made
mighty
in
the
man
you
are
inside
with
power
through
his
spirit
17
and
that
through
your
faith
you
may
have
the
Christ
dwell
in
your
hearts
with
love
May
you
be
rooted
and
established
on
the
foundation
18
in
order
that
with
all
the
holy
ones
you
may
be
thoroughly
able
to
comprehend
fully
what
is
the
breadth
and
length
and
height
and
depth
19
and
to
know
the
love
of
the
Christ
which
surpasses
knowledge
so
that
you
may
be
filled
with
all
the
fullness
that
God
gives
20
Now
to
the
one
who
can
according
to
his
power
that
is
operating
in
us
do
more
than
superabundantly
beyond
all
the
things
we
ask
or
conceive
21
to
him
be
the
glory
by
means
of
the
congregation
and
by
means
of
Christ
Jesus
to
all
generations
forever
and
ever
Amen
1
Therefore
I
the
prisoner
in
the
Lord
appeal
to
you
to
walk
worthily
of
the
calling
with
which
you
were
called
2
with
all
humility
and
mildness
with
patience
putting
up
with
one
another
in
love
3
earnestly
endeavoring
to
maintain
the
oneness
of
the
spirit
in
the
uniting
bond
of
peace
4
One
body
there
is
and
one
spirit
just
as
you
were
called
to
the
one
hope
of
your
calling
5
one
Lord
one
faith
one
baptism
6
one
God
and
Father
of
all
who
is
over
all
and
through
all
and
in
all
7
Now
undeserved
kindness
was
given
to
each
one
of
us
according
to
how
the
Christ
measured
out
the
free
gift
8
For
it
says
When
he
ascended
on
high
he
carried
away
captives
he
gave
gifts
in
men
9
Now
what
does
the
expression
he
ascended
mean
but
that
he
also
descended
into
the
lower
regions
that
is
the
earth
10
The
very
one
who
descended
is
also
the
one
who
ascended
far
above
all
the
heavens
so
that
he
might
give
fullness
to
all
things
11
And
he
gave
some
as
apostles
some
as
prophets
some
as
evangelizers
some
as
shepherds
and
teachers
12
with
a
view
to
the
readjustment
of
the
holy
ones
for
ministerial
work
to
build
up
the
body
of
the
Christ
13
until
we
all
attain
to
the
oneness
of
the
faith
and
of
the
accurate
knowledge
of
the
Son
of
God
to
being
a
full-grown
man
attaining
the
measure
of
stature
that
belongs
to
the
fullness
of
the
Christ
14
So
we
should
no
longer
be
children
tossed
about
as
by
waves
and
carried
here
and
there
by
every
wind
of
teaching
by
means
of
the
trickery
of
men
by
means
of
cunning
in
deceptive
schemes
15
But
speaking
the
truth
let
us
by
love
grow
up
in
all
things
into
him
who
is
the
head
Christ
16
From
him
all
the
body
is
harmoniously
joined
together
and
made
to
cooperate
through
every
joint
that
gives
what
is
needed
When
each
respective
member
functions
properly
this
contributes
to
the
growth
of
the
body
as
it
builds
itself
up
in
love
17
So
this
is
what
I
say
and
bear
witness
to
in
the
Lord
that
you
should
no
longer
go
on
walking
just
as
the
nations
also
walk
in
the
futility
of
their
minds
18
They
are
in
darkness
mentally
and
alienated
from
the
life
that
belongs
to
God
because
of
the
ignorance
that
is
in
them
because
of
the
insensitivity
of
their
hearts
19
Having
gone
past
all
moral
sense
they
gave
themselves
over
to
brazen
conduct
to
practice
every
sort
of
uncleanness
with
greediness
20
But
you
did
not
learn
the
Christ
to
be
like
this
21
if
indeed
you
heard
him
and
were
taught
by
means
of
him
just
as
truth
is
in
Jesus
22
You
were
taught
to
put
away
the
old
personality
that
conforms
to
your
former
course
of
conduct
and
that
is
being
corrupted
according
to
its
deceptive
desires
23
And
you
should
continue
to
be
made
new
in
your
dominant
mental
attitude
24
and
should
put
on
the
new
personality
that
was
created
according
to
Gods
will
in
true
righteousness
and
loyalty
25
Therefore
now
that
you
have
put
away
deceit
each
one
of
you
speak
truth
with
his
neighbor
because
we
are
members
belonging
to
one
another
26
Be
wrathful
but
do
not
sin
do
not
let
the
sun
set
while
you
are
still
angry
27
do
not
give
the
Devil
an
opportunity
28
Let
the
one
who
steals
steal
no
more
rather
let
him
do
hard
work
doing
good
work
with
his
hands
so
that
he
may
have
something
to
share
with
someone
in
need
29
Let
a
rotten
word
not
come
out
of
your
mouth
but
only
what
is
good
for
building
up
as
the
need
may
be
to
impart
what
is
beneficial
to
the
hearers
30
Also
do
not
be
grieving
Gods
holy
spirit
with
which
you
have
been
sealed
for
a
day
of
releasing
by
ransom
31
Put
away
from
yourselves
every
kind
of
malicious
bitterness
anger
wrath
screaming
and
abusive
speech
as
well
as
everything
injurious
32
But
become
kind
to
one
another
tenderly
compassionate
freely
forgiving
one
another
just
as
God
also
by
Christ
freely
forgave
you
1
Therefore
become
imitators
of
God
as
beloved
children
2
and
go
on
walking
in
love
just
as
the
Christ
also
loved
us
and
gave
himself
for
us
as
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice
a
sweet
fragrance
to
God
3
Let
sexual
immorality
and
every
sort
of
uncleanness
or
greediness
not
even
be
mentioned
among
you
just
as
is
proper
for
holy
people
4
neither
shameful
conduct
nor
foolish
talking
nor
obscene
jesting—things
that
are
not
befitting—but
rather
the
giving
of
thanks
5
For
you
know
this
recognizing
it
for
yourselves
that
no
sexually
immoral
person
or
unclean
person
or
greedy
person
which
means
being
an
idolater
has
any
inheritance
in
the
Kingdom
of
the
Christ
and
of
God
6
Let
no
man
deceive
you
with
empty
words
for
because
of
such
things
the
wrath
of
God
is
coming
upon
the
sons
of
disobedience
7
Therefore
do
not
be
sharers
with
them
8
for
you
were
once
darkness
but
you
are
now
light
in
connection
with
the
Lord
Go
on
walking
as
children
of
light
9
for
the
fruitage
of
the
light
consists
of
every
sort
of
goodness
and
righteousness
and
truth
10
Keep
on
making
sure
of
what
is
acceptable
to
the
Lord
11
and
stop
sharing
in
the
unfruitful
works
that
belong
to
the
darkness
rather
expose
them
for
what
they
are
12
For
the
things
they
do
in
secret
are
shameful
even
to
mention
13
Now
all
the
things
that
are
being
exposed
are
made
evident
by
the
light
for
everything
that
is
being
made
evident
is
light
14
Therefore
it
is
said
Awake
O
sleeper
and
arise
from
the
dead
and
the
Christ
will
shine
upon
you
15
So
keep
strict
watch
that
how
you
walk
is
not
as
unwise
but
as
wise
persons
16
making
the
best
use
of
your
time
because
the
days
are
wicked
17
On
this
account
stop
being
unreasonable
but
keep
perceiving
what
the
will
of
Jehovah
is
18
Also
do
not
get
drunk
with
wine
in
which
there
is
debauchery
but
keep
getting
filled
with
spirit
19
Speak
to
one
another
with
psalms
praises
to
God
and
spiritual
songs
singing
and
accompanying
yourselves
with
music
in
your
hearts
to
Jehovah
20
always
giving
thanks
to
our
God
and
Father
for
everything
in
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
21
Be
in
subjection
to
one
another
in
fear
of
Christ
22
Let
wives
be
in
subjection
to
their
husbands
as
to
the
Lord
23
because
a
husband
is
head
of
his
wife
just
as
the
Christ
is
head
of
the
congregation
he
being
a
savior
of
this
body
24
In
fact
as
the
congregation
is
in
subjection
to
the
Christ
wives
should
also
be
to
their
husbands
in
everything
25
Husbands
continue
loving
your
wives
just
as
the
Christ
also
loved
the
congregation
and
gave
himself
up
for
it
26
in
order
that
he
might
sanctify
it
cleansing
it
with
the
bath
of
water
by
means
of
the
word
27
so
that
he
might
present
the
congregation
to
himself
in
its
splendor
without
a
spot
or
a
wrinkle
or
any
of
such
things
but
holy
and
without
blemish
28
In
the
same
way
husbands
should
love
their
wives
as
their
own
bodies
A
man
who
loves
his
wife
loves
himself
29
for
no
man
ever
hated
his
own
body
but
he
feeds
and
cherishes
it
just
as
the
Christ
does
the
congregation
30
because
we
are
members
of
his
body
31
For
this
reason
a
man
will
leave
his
father
and
his
mother
and
he
will
stick
to
his
wife
and
the
two
will
be
one
flesh
32
This
sacred
secret
is
great
Now
I
am
speaking
about
Christ
and
the
congregation
33
Nevertheless
each
one
of
you
must
love
his
wife
as
he
does
himself
on
the
other
hand
the
wife
should
have
deep
respect
for
her
husband
1
Children
be
obedient
to
your
parents
in
union
with
the
Lord
for
this
is
righteous
2
Honor
your
father
and
your
mother
is
the
first
command
with
a
promise
3
That
it
may
go
well
with
you
and
you
may
remain
a
long
time
on
the
earth
4
And
fathers
do
not
be
irritating
your
children
but
go
on
bringing
them
up
in
the
discipline
and
admonition
of
Jehovah
5
Slaves
be
obedient
to
your
human
masters
with
fear
and
trembling
in
the
sincerity
of
your
hearts
as
to
the
Christ
6
not
only
when
being
watched
just
to
please
men
but
as
Christs
slaves
doing
the
will
of
God
whole-souled
7
Slave
with
a
good
attitude
as
to
Jehovah
and
not
to
men
8
for
you
know
that
whatever
good
each
one
does
he
will
receive
this
back
from
Jehovah
whether
he
is
a
slave
or
a
freeman
9
Also
you
masters
keep
treating
them
in
the
same
way
not
threatening
for
you
know
that
both
their
Master
and
yours
is
in
the
heavens
and
there
is
no
partiality
with
him
10
Finally
go
on
acquiring
power
in
the
Lord
and
in
the
mightiness
of
his
strength
11
Put
on
the
complete
suit
of
armor
from
God
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
stand
firm
against
the
crafty
acts
of
the
Devil
12
because
we
have
a
struggle
not
against
blood
and
flesh
but
against
the
governments
against
the
authorities
against
the
world
rulers
of
this
darkness
against
the
wicked
spirit
forces
in
the
heavenly
places
13
For
this
reason
take
up
the
complete
suit
of
armor
from
God
so
that
you
may
be
able
to
resist
in
the
wicked
day
and
after
you
have
accomplished
everything
to
stand
firm
14
Stand
firm
therefore
with
the
belt
of
truth
fastened
around
your
waist
wearing
the
breastplate
of
righteousness
15
and
having
your
feet
shod
in
readiness
to
declare
the
good
news
of
peace
16
Besides
all
of
this
take
up
the
large
shield
of
faith
with
which
you
will
be
able
to
extinguish
all
the
wicked
ones
burning
arrows
17
Also
accept
the
helmet
of
salvation
and
the
sword
of
the
spirit
that
is
Gods
word
18
while
with
every
form
of
prayer
and
supplication
you
carry
on
prayer
on
every
occasion
in
spirit
And
to
that
end
stay
awake
constantly
making
supplication
in
behalf
of
all
the
holy
ones
19
Pray
also
for
me
that
the
words
may
be
given
to
me
when
I
open
my
mouth
so
that
I
may
be
able
to
speak
boldly
in
making
known
the
sacred
secret
of
the
good
news
20
for
which
I
am
acting
as
an
ambassador
in
chains
and
that
I
may
speak
about
it
with
boldness
as
I
ought
to
speak
21
Now
so
that
you
may
also
know
about
me
and
how
I
am
doing
Tychicus
a
beloved
brother
and
faithful
minister
in
the
Lord
will
make
everything
known
to
you
22
I
am
sending
him
to
you
for
this
very
purpose
so
that
you
may
know
how
we
are
and
that
he
may
comfort
your
hearts
23
May
the
brothers
have
peace
and
love
with
faith
from
God
the
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
24
May
the
undeserved
kindness
be
with
all
those
loving
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
in
incorruptness
1
Paul
and
Timothy
slaves
of
Christ
Jesus
to
all
the
holy
ones
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
who
are
in
Philippi
along
with
overseers
and
ministerial
servants
2
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
3
I
thank
my
God
always
when
I
remember
you
4
in
every
supplication
of
mine
for
all
of
you
I
offer
each
supplication
with
joy
5
because
of
the
contribution
you
have
made
to
the
good
news
from
the
first
day
until
this
moment
6
For
I
am
confident
of
this
very
thing
that
the
one
who
started
a
good
work
in
you
will
bring
it
to
completion
until
the
day
of
Christ
Jesus
7
It
is
only
right
for
me
to
think
this
regarding
all
of
you
since
I
have
you
in
my
heart
you
who
are
sharers
with
me
in
the
undeserved
kindness
both
in
my
prison
bonds
and
in
the
defending
and
legally
establishing
of
the
good
news
8
For
God
is
my
witness
of
how
I
am
longing
for
all
of
you
with
such
tender
affection
as
Christ
Jesus
has
9
And
this
is
what
I
continue
praying
that
your
love
may
abound
still
more
and
more
with
accurate
knowledge
and
full
discernment
10
that
you
may
make
sure
of
the
more
important
things
so
that
you
may
be
flawless
and
not
stumbling
others
up
to
the
day
of
Christ
11
and
that
you
may
be
filled
with
righteous
fruit
which
is
through
Jesus
Christ
to
Gods
glory
and
praise
12
Now
I
want
you
to
know
brothers
that
my
situation
has
actually
turned
out
for
the
advancement
of
the
good
news
13
so
that
my
prison
bonds
for
the
sake
of
Christ
have
become
public
knowledge
among
all
the
Praetorian
Guard
and
all
the
rest
14
Now
most
of
the
brothers
in
the
Lord
have
gained
confidence
because
of
my
prison
bonds
and
they
are
showing
all
the
more
courage
to
speak
the
word
of
God
fearlessly
15
True
some
are
preaching
the
Christ
out
of
envy
and
rivalry
but
others
out
of
goodwill
16
The
latter
are
proclaiming
the
Christ
out
of
love
for
they
know
that
I
have
been
appointed
to
defend
the
good
news
17
but
the
former
do
it
out
of
contentiousness
not
with
a
pure
motive
for
they
are
intending
to
create
trouble
for
me
in
my
prison
bonds
18
With
what
result
Only
that
in
every
way
whether
in
pretense
or
in
truth
Christ
is
being
proclaimed
and
I
rejoice
over
this
In
fact
I
will
also
keep
on
rejoicing
19
for
I
know
that
this
will
result
in
my
salvation
through
your
supplication
and
with
the
support
of
the
spirit
of
Jesus
Christ
20
This
is
in
harmony
with
my
eager
expectation
and
hope
that
I
will
not
be
ashamed
in
any
respect
but
that
with
all
freeness
of
speech
Christ
will
now
as
always
before
be
magnified
by
means
of
my
body
whether
through
life
or
through
death
21
For
in
my
case
to
live
is
Christ
and
to
die
is
gain
22
Now
if
I
am
to
live
on
in
the
flesh
this
is
a
fruitage
of
my
work
yet
what
I
would
choose
I
do
not
make
known
23
I
am
torn
between
these
two
things
for
I
do
desire
the
releasing
and
the
being
with
Christ
which
is
to
be
sure
far
better
24
However
it
is
more
necessary
for
me
to
remain
in
the
flesh
for
your
sakes
25
So
being
confident
of
this
I
know
I
will
remain
and
continue
with
all
of
you
for
your
advancement
and
your
joy
in
the
faith
26
so
that
your
exultation
may
overflow
in
Christ
Jesus
because
of
me
when
I
am
again
present
with
you
27
Only
behave
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
good
news
about
the
Christ
so
that
whether
I
come
and
see
you
or
I
am
absent
I
may
hear
about
you
and
learn
that
you
are
standing
firm
in
one
spirit
with
one
soul
striving
side
by
side
for
the
faith
of
the
good
news
28
and
in
no
way
being
frightened
by
your
opponents
This
very
thing
is
a
proof
of
destruction
for
them
but
of
salvation
for
you
and
this
is
from
God
29
For
you
have
been
given
the
privilege
in
behalf
of
Christ
not
only
to
put
your
faith
in
him
but
also
to
suffer
in
his
behalf
30
For
you
are
facing
the
same
struggle
that
you
saw
me
face
which
you
now
hear
that
I
am
still
facing
1
If
then
there
is
any
encouragement
in
Christ
if
any
consolation
of
love
if
any
spiritual
fellowship
if
any
tender
affection
and
compassion
2
make
my
joy
full
by
being
of
the
same
mind
and
having
the
same
love
being
completely
united
having
the
one
thought
in
mind
3
Do
nothing
out
of
contentiousness
or
out
of
egotism
but
with
humility
consider
others
superior
to
you
4
as
you
look
out
not
only
for
your
own
interests
but
also
for
the
interests
of
others
5
Keep
this
mental
attitude
in
you
that
was
also
in
Christ
Jesus
6
who
although
he
was
existing
in
Gods
form
gave
no
consideration
to
a
seizure
namely
that
he
should
be
equal
to
God
7
No
but
he
emptied
himself
and
took
a
slaves
form
and
became
human
8
More
than
that
when
he
came
as
a
man
he
humbled
himself
and
became
obedient
to
the
point
of
death
yes
death
on
a
torture
stake
9
For
this
very
reason
God
exalted
him
to
a
superior
position
and
kindly
gave
him
the
name
that
is
above
every
other
name
10
so
that
in
the
name
of
Jesus
every
knee
should
bend—of
those
in
heaven
and
those
on
earth
and
those
under
the
ground—
11
and
every
tongue
should
openly
acknowledge
that
Jesus
Christ
is
Lord
to
the
glory
of
God
the
Father
12
Consequently
my
beloved
ones
just
as
you
have
always
obeyed
not
only
during
my
presence
but
now
much
more
readily
during
my
absence
keep
working
out
your
own
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
13
For
God
is
the
one
who
for
the
sake
of
his
good
pleasure
energizes
you
giving
you
both
the
desire
and
the
power
to
act
14
Keep
doing
all
things
free
from
murmuring
and
arguments
15
so
that
you
may
come
to
be
blameless
and
innocent
children
of
God
without
a
blemish
in
the
midst
of
a
crooked
and
twisted
generation
among
whom
you
are
shining
as
illuminators
in
the
world
16
keeping
a
tight
grip
on
the
word
of
life
Then
I
may
have
reason
for
rejoicing
in
Christs
day
knowing
that
I
did
not
run
in
vain
or
work
hard
in
vain
17
However
even
if
I
am
being
poured
out
like
a
drink
offering
on
the
sacrifice
and
the
holy
service
to
which
your
faith
has
led
you
I
am
glad
and
I
rejoice
with
all
of
you
18
In
the
same
way
you
also
should
be
glad
and
rejoice
with
me
19
Now
I
am
hoping
in
the
Lord
Jesus
to
send
Timothy
to
you
shortly
so
that
I
may
be
encouraged
when
I
receive
news
about
you
20
For
I
have
no
one
else
of
a
disposition
like
his
who
will
genuinely
care
for
your
concerns
21
For
all
the
others
are
seeking
their
own
interests
not
those
of
Jesus
Christ
22
But
you
know
the
proof
he
gave
of
himself
that
like
a
child
with
a
father
he
slaved
with
me
to
advance
the
good
news
23
Therefore
he
is
the
one
I
am
hoping
to
send
just
as
soon
as
I
see
how
things
turn
out
for
me
24
Indeed
I
am
confident
in
the
Lord
that
I
myself
will
also
come
soon
25
But
for
now
I
consider
it
necessary
to
send
to
you
Epaphroditus
my
brother
and
fellow
worker
and
fellow
soldier
and
your
envoy
and
personal
servant
for
my
need
26
since
he
is
longing
to
see
all
of
you
and
is
depressed
because
you
heard
he
had
fallen
sick
27
Indeed
he
did
fall
sick
nearly
to
the
point
of
death
but
God
had
mercy
on
him
in
fact
not
only
on
him
but
also
on
me
so
that
I
should
not
have
one
grief
after
another
28
Therefore
I
am
sending
him
with
the
greatest
urgency
so
that
when
you
see
him
you
may
again
rejoice
and
I
may
also
be
less
anxious
29
So
give
him
the
customary
welcome
in
the
Lord
with
all
joy
and
keep
holding
men
of
that
sort
dear
30
because
he
nearly
died
on
account
of
the
work
of
Christ
risking
his
life
in
order
to
make
up
for
your
not
being
here
to
render
personal
service
to
me
1
Finally
my
brothers
continue
rejoicing
in
the
Lord
It
is
not
troublesome
for
me
to
write
the
same
things
to
you
and
it
is
for
your
safety
2
Look
out
for
the
dogs
look
out
for
those
who
cause
injury
look
out
for
those
who
mutilate
the
flesh
3
For
we
are
those
with
the
real
circumcision
we
who
are
rendering
sacred
service
by
Gods
spirit
and
boasting
in
Christ
Jesus
and
who
do
not
base
our
confidence
in
the
flesh
4
though
I
if
anyone
do
have
grounds
for
confidence
in
the
flesh
If
any
other
man
thinks
he
has
grounds
for
confidence
in
the
flesh
I
have
more
5
circumcised
the
eighth
day
of
the
nation
of
Israel
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
a
Hebrew
born
from
Hebrews
regarding
law
a
Pharisee
6
regarding
zeal
persecuting
the
congregation
regarding
righteousness
based
on
law
one
who
proved
himself
blameless
7
Yet
the
things
that
were
gains
to
me
I
have
considered
loss
on
account
of
the
Christ
8
What
is
more
I
do
indeed
also
consider
all
things
to
be
loss
on
account
of
the
excelling
value
of
the
knowledge
of
Christ
Jesus
my
Lord
For
his
sake
I
have
taken
the
loss
of
all
things
and
I
consider
them
as
a
lot
of
refuse
that
I
may
gain
Christ
9
and
be
found
in
union
with
him
not
because
of
my
own
righteousness
from
following
the
Law
but
because
of
the
righteousness
that
is
through
faith
in
Christ
the
righteousness
from
God
based
on
faith
10
My
aim
is
to
know
him
and
the
power
of
his
resurrection
and
to
share
in
his
sufferings
submitting
myself
to
a
death
like
his
11
to
see
if
at
all
possible
I
may
attain
to
the
earlier
resurrection
from
the
dead
12
Not
that
I
have
already
received
it
or
am
already
made
perfect
but
I
am
pressing
on
to
see
if
I
may
also
lay
hold
on
that
for
which
Christ
Jesus
selected
me
13
Brothers
I
do
not
yet
consider
myself
as
having
taken
hold
of
it
but
one
thing
is
certain
Forgetting
the
things
behind
and
stretching
forward
to
the
things
ahead
14
I
am
pressing
on
toward
the
goal
for
the
prize
of
the
upward
call
of
God
by
means
of
Christ
Jesus
15
Therefore
let
those
of
us
who
are
mature
be
of
this
mental
attitude
and
if
you
are
mentally
inclined
otherwise
in
any
respect
God
will
reveal
the
above
attitude
to
you
16
At
any
rate
to
the
extent
we
have
made
progress
let
us
go
on
walking
orderly
in
this
same
course
17
Unitedly
become
imitators
of
me
brothers
and
keep
your
eye
on
those
who
are
walking
in
a
way
that
is
in
harmony
with
the
example
we
set
for
you
18
For
there
are
many—I
used
to
mention
them
often
but
now
I
mention
them
also
with
weeping—who
are
walking
as
enemies
of
the
torture
stake
of
the
Christ
19
Their
end
is
destruction
and
their
god
is
their
belly
and
their
glory
is
really
their
shame
and
they
have
their
minds
on
earthly
things
20
But
our
citizenship
exists
in
the
heavens
and
we
are
eagerly
waiting
for
a
savior
from
there
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
21
who
will
transform
our
humble
body
to
be
like
his
glorious
body
by
his
great
power
that
enables
him
to
subject
all
things
to
himself
1
Consequently
my
brothers
whom
I
love
and
long
for
my
joy
and
crown
stand
firm
in
this
way
in
the
Lord
my
beloved
ones
2
I
urge
Euodia
and
I
urge
Syntyche
to
be
of
the
same
mind
in
the
Lord
3
Yes
I
request
you
also
as
a
true
fellow
worker
to
keep
assisting
these
women
who
have
striven
side
by
side
with
me
for
the
good
news
along
with
Clement
as
well
as
the
rest
of
my
fellow
workers
whose
names
are
in
the
book
of
life
4
Always
rejoice
in
the
Lord
Again
I
will
say
Rejoice
5
Let
your
reasonableness
become
known
to
all
men
The
Lord
is
near
6
Do
not
be
anxious
over
anything
but
in
everything
by
prayer
and
supplication
along
with
thanksgiving
let
your
petitions
be
made
known
to
God
7
and
the
peace
of
God
that
surpasses
all
understanding
will
guard
your
hearts
and
your
mental
powers
by
means
of
Christ
Jesus
8
Finally
brothers
whatever
things
are
true
whatever
things
are
of
serious
concern
whatever
things
are
righteous
whatever
things
are
chaste
whatever
things
are
lovable
whatever
things
are
well-spoken-of
whatever
things
are
virtuous
and
whatever
things
are
praiseworthy
continue
considering
these
things
9
The
things
that
you
learned
as
well
as
accepted
and
heard
and
saw
in
connection
with
me
practice
these
and
the
God
of
peace
will
be
with
you
10
I
rejoice
greatly
in
the
Lord
that
now
at
last
you
have
renewed
your
concern
for
me
Though
you
were
concerned
about
me
you
lacked
opportunity
to
show
it
11
Not
that
I
am
saying
this
because
I
am
in
need
for
I
have
learned
to
be
self-sufficient
regardless
of
my
circumstances
12
I
know
how
to
be
low
on
provisions
and
how
to
have
an
abundance
In
everything
and
in
all
circumstances
I
have
learned
the
secret
of
both
how
to
be
full
and
how
to
hunger
both
how
to
have
an
abundance
and
how
to
do
without
13
For
all
things
I
have
the
strength
through
the
one
who
gives
me
power
14
Nevertheless
you
did
well
to
share
with
me
in
my
tribulation
15
In
fact
you
Philippians
also
know
that
after
you
first
learned
the
good
news
when
I
departed
from
Macedonia
not
a
congregation
shared
with
me
in
the
matter
of
giving
and
receiving
except
you
alone
16
for
while
I
was
in
Thessalonica
you
sent
something
to
me
for
my
need
not
just
once
but
twice
17
Not
that
I
am
looking
for
a
gift
but
I
want
the
fruitage
that
brings
more
credit
to
your
account
18
However
I
have
everything
I
need
and
even
more
I
am
fully
supplied
now
that
I
have
received
from
Epaphroditus
what
you
sent
a
sweet
fragrance
an
acceptable
sacrifice
well-pleasing
to
God
19
In
turn
my
God
will
fully
supply
all
your
need
according
to
his
riches
in
glory
by
means
of
Christ
Jesus
20
Now
to
our
God
and
Father
be
the
glory
forever
and
ever
Amen
21
Give
my
greetings
to
every
holy
one
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
The
brothers
who
are
with
me
send
you
their
greetings
22
All
the
holy
ones
but
especially
those
of
the
household
of
Caesar
send
you
their
greetings
23
The
undeserved
kindness
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
the
spirit
you
show
1
Paul
an
apostle
of
Christ
Jesus
through
Gods
will
and
Timothy
our
brother
2
to
the
holy
ones
and
faithful
brothers
in
union
with
Christ
at
Colossae
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
our
Father
3
We
always
thank
God
the
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
when
we
pray
for
you
4
since
we
heard
of
your
faith
in
Christ
Jesus
and
the
love
you
have
for
all
the
holy
ones
5
because
of
the
hope
that
is
being
reserved
for
you
in
the
heavens
You
previously
heard
about
this
hope
through
the
message
of
truth
of
the
good
news
6
that
has
come
to
you
Just
as
the
good
news
is
bearing
fruit
and
increasing
in
all
the
world
so
it
is
also
doing
among
you
from
the
day
you
heard
and
accurately
knew
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
in
truth
7
That
is
what
you
have
learned
from
our
beloved
fellow
slave
Epaphras
who
is
a
faithful
minister
of
the
Christ
on
our
behalf
8
He
also
made
known
to
us
your
love
in
a
spiritual
way

That
is
also
why
from
the
day
we
heard
of
it
we
have
never
stopped
praying
for
you
and
asking
that
you
may
be
filled
with
the
accurate
knowledge
of
his
will
in
all
wisdom
and
spiritual
comprehension
10
so
as
to
walk
worthily
of
Jehovah
in
order
to
please
him
fully
as
you
go
on
bearing
fruit
in
every
good
work
and
increasing
in
the
accurate
knowledge
of
God
11
and
may
you
be
strengthened
with
all
power
according
to
his
glorious
might
so
that
you
may
endure
fully
with
patience
and
joy
12
as
you
thank
the
Father
who
made
you
qualify
to
share
in
the
inheritance
of
the
holy
ones
in
the
light
13
He
rescued
us
from
the
authority
of
the
darkness
and
transferred
us
into
the
kingdom
of
his
beloved
Son
14
by
means
of
whom
we
have
our
release
by
ransom
the
forgiveness
of
our
sins
15
He
is
the
image
of
the
invisible
God
the
firstborn
of
all
creation
16
because
by
means
of
him
all
other
things
were
created
in
the
heavens
and
on
the
earth
the
things
visible
and
the
things
invisible
whether
they
are
thrones
or
lordships
or
governments
or
authorities
All
other
things
have
been
created
through
him
and
for
him
17
Also
he
is
before
all
other
things
and
by
means
of
him
all
other
things
were
made
to
exist
18
and
he
is
the
head
of
the
body
the
congregation
He
is
the
beginning
the
firstborn
from
the
dead
so
that
he
might
become
the
one
who
is
first
in
all
things
19
because
God
was
pleased
to
have
all
fullness
to
dwell
in
him
20
and
through
him
to
reconcile
to
himself
all
other
things
by
making
peace
through
the
blood
he
shed
on
the
torture
stake
whether
the
things
on
the
earth
or
the
things
in
the
heavens
21
Indeed
you
who
were
once
alienated
and
enemies
because
your
minds
were
on
the
works
that
were
wicked
22
he
has
now
reconciled
by
means
of
that
ones
fleshly
body
through
his
death
in
order
to
present
you
holy
and
unblemished
and
open
to
no
accusation
before
him—
23
provided
of
course
that
you
continue
in
the
faith
established
on
the
foundation
and
steadfast
not
being
shifted
away
from
the
hope
of
that
good
news
that
you
heard
and
that
was
preached
in
all
creation
under
heaven
Of
this
good
news
I
Paul
became
a
minister
24
I
am
now
rejoicing
in
my
sufferings
for
your
sake
and
I
am
undergoing
the
tribulations
of
the
Christ
that
are
yet
lacking
in
my
flesh
in
behalf
of
his
body
which
is
the
congregation
25
I
became
a
minister
of
this
congregation
in
accord
with
the
stewardship
from
God
that
was
given
to
me
in
your
behalf
to
preach
the
word
of
God
fully
26
the
sacred
secret
that
was
hidden
from
the
past
systems
of
things
and
from
the
past
generations
But
now
it
has
been
revealed
to
his
holy
ones
27
to
whom
God
has
been
pleased
to
make
known
among
the
nations
the
glorious
riches
of
this
sacred
secret
which
is
Christ
in
union
with
you
the
hope
of
his
glory
28
He
is
the
one
we
are
proclaiming
admonishing
everyone
and
teaching
everyone
in
all
wisdom
so
that
we
may
present
every
person
complete
in
union
with
Christ
29
To
this
end
I
am
indeed
working
hard
exerting
myself
with
his
strength
that
is
operating
powerfully
within
me
1
For
I
want
you
to
realize
how
great
a
struggle
I
am
having
in
your
behalf
and
in
behalf
of
those
at
Laodicea
and
in
behalf
of
all
those
who
have
not
personally
seen
me
2
This
is
so
that
their
hearts
may
be
comforted
and
that
they
may
be
harmoniously
joined
together
in
love
and
may
have
all
the
riches
that
result
from
the
full
assurance
of
their
understanding
in
order
to
gain
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
sacred
secret
of
God
namely
Christ
3
Carefully
concealed
in
him
are
all
the
treasures
of
wisdom
and
of
knowledge
4
I
am
saying
this
so
that
no
one
may
delude
you
with
persuasive
arguments
5
Though
I
am
absent
in
body
I
am
with
you
in
spirit
rejoicing
to
see
your
good
order
and
the
firmness
of
your
faith
in
Christ
6
Therefore
just
as
you
have
accepted
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
go
on
walking
in
union
with
him
7
being
rooted
and
built
up
in
him
and
being
stabilized
in
the
faith
just
as
you
were
taught
and
overflowing
with
thanksgiving
8
Look
out
that
no
one
takes
you
captive
by
means
of
the
philosophy
and
empty
deception
according
to
human
tradition
according
to
the
elementary
things
of
the
world
and
not
according
to
Christ
9
because
it
is
in
him
that
all
the
fullness
of
the
divine
quality
dwells
bodily
10
So
you
have
acquired
a
fullness
by
means
of
him
the
one
who
is
the
head
of
all
government
and
authority
11
By
your
relationship
with
him
you
were
also
circumcised
with
a
circumcision
performed
without
hands
by
stripping
off
the
fleshly
body
by
the
circumcision
that
belongs
to
the
Christ
12
For
you
were
buried
with
him
in
his
baptism
and
by
your
relationship
with
him
you
were
also
raised
up
together
through
your
faith
in
the
powerful
work
of
God
who
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
13
Furthermore
though
you
were
dead
in
your
trespasses
and
in
the
uncircumcised
state
of
your
flesh
God
made
you
alive
together
with
him
He
kindly
forgave
us
all
our
trespasses
14
and
erased
the
handwritten
document
that
consisted
of
decrees
and
was
in
opposition
to
us
He
has
taken
it
out
of
the
way
by
nailing
it
to
the
torture
stake
15
He
has
stripped
the
governments
and
the
authorities
bare
and
has
publicly
exhibited
them
as
conquered
leading
them
in
a
triumphal
procession
by
means
of
it
16
Therefore
do
not
let
anyone
judge
you
about
what
you
eat
and
drink
or
about
the
observance
of
a
festival
or
of
the
new
moon
or
of
a
sabbath
17
Those
things
are
a
shadow
of
the
things
to
come
but
the
reality
belongs
to
the
Christ
18
Let
no
man
deprive
you
of
the
prize
who
takes
delight
in
a
false
humility
and
a
form
of
worship
of
the
angels
taking
his
stand
on
the
things
he
has
seen
He
is
actually
puffed
up
without
proper
cause
by
his
fleshly
frame
of
mind
19
and
he
is
not
holding
fast
to
the
head
to
the
one
through
whom
the
whole
body
is
supplied
and
harmoniously
joined
together
by
means
of
its
joints
and
ligaments
and
made
to
grow
with
the
growth
that
is
from
God
20
If
you
died
together
with
Christ
with
respect
to
the
elementary
things
of
the
world
why
do
you
live
as
if
still
part
of
the
world
by
further
subjecting
yourselves
to
the
decrees
21
Do
not
handle
nor
taste
nor
touch

22
referring
to
things
that
all
perish
with
their
use
according
to
the
commands
and
teachings
of
men
23
Although
those
things
have
an
appearance
of
wisdom
in
a
self-imposed
form
of
worship
and
a
false
humility
a
harsh
treatment
of
the
body
they
are
of
no
value
in
combating
the
satisfying
of
the
flesh
1
If
however
you
were
raised
up
with
the
Christ
go
on
seeking
the
things
above
where
the
Christ
is
seated
at
the
right
hand
of
God
2
Keep
your
minds
fixed
on
the
things
above
not
on
the
things
on
the
earth
3
For
you
died
and
your
life
has
been
hidden
with
the
Christ
in
union
with
God
4
When
the
Christ
our
life
is
made
manifest
then
you
also
will
be
made
manifest
with
him
in
glory
5
Deaden
therefore
your
body
members
that
are
on
the
earth
as
respects
sexual
immorality
uncleanness
uncontrolled
sexual
passion
hurtful
desire
and
greediness
which
is
idolatry
6
On
account
of
those
things
the
wrath
of
God
is
coming
7
That
is
how
you
too
used
to
conduct
yourselves
in
your
former
way
of
life
8
But
now
you
must
put
them
all
away
from
you
wrath
anger
badness
abusive
speech
and
obscene
talk
out
of
your
mouth
9
Do
not
lie
to
one
another
Strip
off
the
old
personality
with
its
practices
10
and
clothe
yourselves
with
the
new
personality
which
through
accurate
knowledge
is
being
made
new
according
to
the
image
of
the
One
who
created
it
11
where
there
is
neither
Greek
nor
Jew
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
foreigner
Scythian
slave
or
freeman
but
Christ
is
all
things
and
in
all
12
Accordingly
as
Gods
chosen
ones
holy
and
loved
clothe
yourselves
with
the
tender
affections
of
compassion
kindness
humility
mildness
and
patience
13
Continue
putting
up
with
one
another
and
forgiving
one
another
freely
even
if
anyone
has
a
cause
for
complaint
against
another
Just
as
Jehovah
freely
forgave
you
you
must
also
do
the
same
14
But
besides
all
these
things
clothe
yourselves
with
love
for
it
is
a
perfect
bond
of
union
15
Also
let
the
peace
of
the
Christ
rule
in
your
hearts
for
you
were
called
to
that
peace
in
one
body
And
show
yourselves
thankful
16
Let
the
word
of
the
Christ
reside
in
you
richly
in
all
wisdom
Keep
on
teaching
and
encouraging
one
another
with
psalms
praises
to
God
spiritual
songs
sung
with
gratitude
singing
in
your
hearts
to
Jehovah
17
Whatever
it
is
that
you
do
in
word
or
in
deed
do
everything
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
Jesus
thanking
God
the
Father
through
him
18
You
wives
be
in
subjection
to
your
husbands
as
it
is
becoming
in
the
Lord
19
You
husbands
keep
on
loving
your
wives
and
do
not
be
bitterly
angry
with
them
20
You
children
be
obedient
to
your
parents
in
everything
for
this
is
well-pleasing
to
the
Lord
21
You
fathers
do
not
be
exasperating
your
children
so
that
they
do
not
become
downhearted
22
You
slaves
be
obedient
in
everything
to
those
who
are
your
human
masters
not
only
when
they
are
watching
just
to
please
men
but
with
sincerity
of
heart
with
fear
of
Jehovah
23
Whatever
you
are
doing
work
at
it
whole-souled
as
for
Jehovah
and
not
for
men
24
for
you
know
that
it
is
from
Jehovah
you
will
receive
the
inheritance
as
a
reward
Slave
for
the
Master
Christ
25
Certainly
the
one
who
does
wrong
will
be
repaid
for
the
wrong
he
has
done
and
there
is
no
partiality
1
You
masters
treat
your
slaves
in
a
righteous
and
fair
way
knowing
that
you
also
have
a
Master
in
heaven
2
Persevere
in
prayer
remaining
awake
in
it
with
thanksgiving
3
At
the
same
time
pray
also
for
us
that
God
may
open
a
door
for
the
word
so
that
we
can
declare
the
sacred
secret
about
the
Christ
for
which
I
am
in
prison
bonds
4
and
that
I
may
proclaim
it
as
clearly
as
I
ought
to
5
Go
on
walking
in
wisdom
toward
those
on
the
outside
making
the
best
use
of
your
time
6
Let
your
words
always
be
gracious
seasoned
with
salt
so
that
you
will
know
how
you
should
answer
each
person
7
Tychicus
my
beloved
brother
and
faithful
minister
and
fellow
slave
in
the
Lord
will
tell
you
all
the
news
about
me
8
I
am
sending
him
to
you
so
that
you
will
know
how
we
are
and
that
he
may
comfort
your
hearts
9
He
is
coming
along
with
Onesimus
my
faithful
and
beloved
brother
who
is
from
among
you
they
will
tell
you
all
the
things
happening
here
10
Aristarchus
my
fellow
captive
sends
you
his
greetings
and
so
does
Mark
the
cousin
of
Barnabas
concerning
whom
you
received
instructions
to
welcome
him
if
he
comes
to
you
11
and
Jesus
who
is
called
Justus
who
are
of
those
circumcised
Only
these
are
my
fellow
workers
for
the
Kingdom
of
God
and
they
have
become
a
source
of
great
comfort
to
me
12
Epaphras
a
slave
of
Christ
Jesus
who
is
from
among
you
sends
you
his
greetings
He
is
always
exerting
himself
in
your
behalf
in
his
prayers
so
that
you
may
finally
stand
complete
and
with
firm
conviction
in
all
the
will
of
God
13
For
I
bear
him
witness
that
he
makes
great
efforts
in
your
behalf
and
in
behalf
of
those
in
Laodicea
and
Hierapolis
14
Luke
the
beloved
physician
sends
you
his
greetings
and
so
does
Demas
15
Give
my
greetings
to
the
brothers
in
Laodicea
and
to
Nympha
and
to
the
congregation
at
her
house
16
And
when
this
letter
has
been
read
among
you
arrange
for
it
also
to
be
read
in
the
congregation
of
the
Laodiceans
and
for
you
also
to
read
the
one
from
Laodicea
17
Also
tell
Archippus
Pay
attention
to
the
ministry
that
you
accepted
in
the
Lord
in
order
to
fulfill
it
18
Here
is
my
greeting
Pauls
in
my
own
hand
Keep
my
prison
bonds
in
mind
The
undeserved
kindness
be
with
you
1
Paul
Silvanus
and
Timothy
to
the
congregation
of
the
Thessalonians
in
union
with
God
the
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
2
We
always
thank
God
when
we
mention
all
of
you
in
our
prayers
3
for
we
continually
remember
your
faithful
work
your
loving
labor
and
your
endurance
because
of
your
hope
in
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
in
the
presence
of
our
God
and
Father
4
For
we
know
brothers
loved
by
God
his
choosing
of
you
5
because
the
good
news
we
preach
did
not
come
to
you
with
speech
alone
but
also
with
power
and
with
holy
spirit
and
with
strong
conviction
just
as
you
know
what
sort
of
men
we
became
among
you
for
your
sakes
6
And
you
became
imitators
of
us
and
of
the
Lord
seeing
that
you
accepted
the
word
under
much
tribulation
with
joy
of
holy
spirit
7
so
that
you
became
an
example
to
all
the
believers
in
Macedonia
and
in
Achaia
8
The
fact
is
not
only
has
the
word
of
Jehovah
sounded
out
from
you
in
Macedonia
and
Achaia
but
your
faith
in
God
has
spread
abroad
in
every
place
so
that
we
do
not
need
to
say
anything
9
For
they
themselves
keep
reporting
about
our
first
contact
with
you
and
how
you
turned
to
God
from
your
idols
to
slave
for
a
living
and
true
God
10
and
to
wait
for
his
Son
from
the
heavens
whom
he
raised
up
from
the
dead
namely
Jesus
who
rescues
us
from
the
wrath
that
is
coming
1
You
yourselves
surely
know
brothers
that
our
visit
to
you
has
not
been
without
results
2
For
although
we
had
first
suffered
and
been
insolently
treated
in
Philippi
as
you
know
we
mustered
up
boldness
by
means
of
our
God
to
tell
you
the
good
news
of
God
in
the
face
of
much
opposition
3
For
the
exhortation
we
give
does
not
spring
from
error
or
from
uncleanness
or
with
deceit
4
but
just
as
we
have
been
approved
by
God
to
be
entrusted
with
the
good
news
so
we
speak
to
please
not
men
but
God
who
examines
our
hearts
5
In
fact
you
know
that
we
never
used
flattering
speech
or
put
on
any
false
front
with
greedy
motives
God
is
witness
6
Nor
have
we
been
seeking
glory
from
men
either
from
you
or
from
others
though
we
could
be
an
expensive
burden
as
apostles
of
Christ
7
On
the
contrary
we
became
gentle
in
your
midst
as
when
a
nursing
mother
tenderly
cares
for
her
own
children
8
So
having
tender
affection
for
you
we
were
determined
to
impart
to
you
not
only
the
good
news
of
God
but
also
our
very
selves
because
you
became
so
beloved
to
us
9
Surely
you
remember
brothers
our
labor
and
toil
We
were
working
night
and
day
so
that
we
would
not
put
an
expensive
burden
on
any
one
of
you
when
we
preached
the
good
news
of
God
to
you
10
You
are
witnesses
God
is
also
of
how
loyal
and
righteous
and
blameless
we
behaved
toward
you
believers
11
You
well
know
that
we
kept
exhorting
and
consoling
you
and
bearing
witness
to
each
one
of
you
just
as
a
father
does
his
children
12
so
that
you
would
go
on
walking
worthily
of
God
who
is
calling
you
to
his
Kingdom
and
glory
13
Indeed
that
is
why
we
also
thank
God
unceasingly
because
when
you
received
Gods
word
which
you
heard
from
us
you
accepted
it
not
as
the
word
of
men
but
just
as
it
truthfully
is
as
the
word
of
God
which
is
also
at
work
in
you
believers
14
For
you
brothers
became
imitators
of
the
congregations
of
God
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
that
are
in
Judea
because
you
suffered
at
the
hands
of
your
own
countrymen
the
same
things
that
they
also
are
suffering
at
the
hands
of
the
Jews
15
who
even
killed
the
Lord
Jesus
and
the
prophets
and
persecuted
us
Furthermore
they
are
not
pleasing
God
but
are
against
the
interests
of
all
men
16
as
they
try
to
prevent
us
from
speaking
to
people
of
the
nations
so
that
these
might
be
saved
In
this
way
they
always
fill
up
the
measure
of
their
sins
But
his
wrath
has
at
last
come
upon
them
17
But
when
we
were
separated
from
you
brothers
for
just
a
short
time
in
person
not
in
our
hearts
because
of
our
strong
desire
we
made
every
effort
to
see
you
in
person
18
For
this
reason
we
wanted
to
come
to
you
yes
I
Paul
tried
not
just
once
but
twice
yet
Satan
cut
across
our
path
19
For
what
is
our
hope
or
joy
or
crown
of
exultation
before
our
Lord
Jesus
at
his
presence
Is
it
not
in
fact
you
20
You
certainly
are
our
glory
and
joy
1
So
when
we
could
bear
it
no
longer
we
thought
it
best
to
stay
on
alone
in
Athens
2
and
we
sent
Timothy
our
brother
and
Gods
minister
in
the
good
news
about
the
Christ
to
make
you
firm
and
comfort
you
regarding
your
faith
3
so
that
no
one
might
be
shaken
by
these
tribulations
For
you
yourselves
know
that
we
cannot
avoid
suffering
such
things
4
For
when
we
were
with
you
we
used
to
tell
you
in
advance
that
we
would
suffer
tribulation
and
that
is
what
has
happened
just
as
you
know
5
That
is
why
when
I
could
bear
it
no
longer
I
sent
to
learn
of
your
faithfulness
in
case
somehow
the
Tempter
might
have
tempted
you
and
our
labor
might
have
turned
out
to
be
in
vain
6
But
Timothy
has
just
now
come
to
us
from
you
and
has
given
us
the
good
news
about
your
faithfulness
and
love
that
you
always
continue
to
remember
us
fondly
and
that
you
long
to
see
us
in
the
same
way
as
we
also
do
you
7
That
is
why
brothers
in
all
our
distress
and
tribulation
we
have
been
comforted
because
of
you
and
the
faithfulness
you
demonstrate
8
Because
we
are
revitalized
if
you
are
standing
firm
in
the
Lord
9
For
how
can
we
show
our
thanks
to
God
concerning
you
in
return
for
the
great
joy
we
feel
before
our
God
on
your
account
10
Night
and
day
we
make
supplications
as
earnestly
as
we
can
to
see
you
in
person
and
to
supply
what
is
lacking
in
your
faith
11
Now
may
our
God
and
Father
himself
and
our
Lord
Jesus
make
a
way
for
us
to
come
to
you
12
Moreover
may
the
Lord
cause
you
to
increase
yes
to
abound
in
love
for
one
another
and
for
all
just
as
we
do
for
you
13
so
that
he
may
make
your
hearts
firm
blameless
in
holiness
before
our
God
and
Father
at
the
presence
of
our
Lord
Jesus
with
all
his
holy
ones
1
Finally
brothers
just
as
you
received
instruction
from
us
on
how
you
should
walk
in
order
to
please
God
just
as
you
are
in
fact
walking
we
request
you
and
appeal
to
you
by
the
Lord
Jesus
to
keep
doing
it
more
fully
2
For
you
know
the
instructions
we
gave
you
through
the
Lord
Jesus
3
For
this
is
the
will
of
God
that
you
should
be
holy
and
abstain
from
sexual
immorality
4
Each
one
of
you
should
know
how
to
control
his
own
body
in
holiness
and
honor
5
not
with
greedy
uncontrolled
sexual
passion
like
the
nations
have
that
do
not
know
God
6
No
one
should
go
beyond
proper
limits
and
take
advantage
of
his
brother
in
this
matter
because
Jehovah
exacts
punishment
for
all
these
things
just
as
we
told
you
previously
and
also
strongly
warned
you
7
For
God
has
called
us
not
for
uncleanness
but
for
holiness
8
So
then
the
man
who
disregards
this
is
disregarding
not
man
but
God
who
gives
you
his
holy
spirit
9
However
concerning
brotherly
love
you
do
not
need
us
to
write
to
you
for
you
yourselves
are
taught
by
God
to
love
one
another
10
In
fact
you
are
doing
so
toward
all
the
brothers
in
all
of
Macedonia
But
we
urge
you
brothers
to
go
on
doing
so
in
fuller
measure
11
Make
it
your
aim
to
live
quietly
and
to
mind
your
own
business
and
to
work
with
your
hands
just
as
we
instructed
you
12
so
that
you
may
walk
decently
in
the
eyes
of
people
outside
and
not
need
anything
13
Moreover
brothers
we
do
not
want
you
to
be
ignorant
about
those
who
are
sleeping
in
death
so
that
you
may
not
sorrow
as
the
rest
do
who
have
no
hope
14
For
if
we
have
faith
that
Jesus
died
and
rose
again
so
too
God
will
bring
with
him
those
who
have
fallen
asleep
in
death
through
Jesus
15
For
this
is
what
we
tell
you
by
Jehovahs
word
that
we
the
living
who
survive
to
the
presence
of
the
Lord
will
in
no
way
precede
those
who
have
fallen
asleep
in
death
16
because
the
Lord
himself
will
descend
from
heaven
with
a
commanding
call
with
an
archangels
voice
and
with
Gods
trumpet
and
those
who
are
dead
in
union
with
Christ
will
rise
first
17
Afterward
we
the
living
who
are
surviving
will
together
with
them
be
caught
away
in
clouds
to
meet
the
Lord
in
the
air
and
thus
we
will
always
be
with
the
Lord
18
So
keep
comforting
one
another
with
these
words
1
Now
as
for
the
times
and
the
seasons
brothers
you
need
nothing
to
be
written
to
you
2
For
you
yourselves
know
very
well
that
Jehovahs
day
is
coming
exactly
as
a
thief
in
the
night
3
Whenever
it
is
that
they
are
saying
Peace
and
security
then
sudden
destruction
is
to
be
instantly
on
them
just
like
birth
pains
on
a
pregnant
woman
and
they
will
by
no
means
escape
4
But
you
brothers
you
are
not
in
darkness
so
that
the
day
should
overtake
you
as
it
would
thieves
5
for
you
are
all
sons
of
light
and
sons
of
day
We
belong
neither
to
night
nor
to
darkness
6
So
then
let
us
not
sleep
on
as
the
rest
do
but
let
us
stay
awake
and
keep
our
senses
7
For
those
who
sleep
sleep
at
night
and
those
who
get
drunk
are
drunk
at
night
8
But
as
for
us
who
belong
to
the
day
let
us
keep
our
senses
and
put
on
the
breastplate
of
faith
and
love
and
the
hope
of
salvation
as
a
helmet
9
because
God
assigned
us
not
to
wrath
but
to
the
acquiring
of
salvation
through
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
10
He
died
for
us
so
that
whether
we
stay
awake
or
are
asleep
we
should
live
together
with
him
11
Therefore
keep
encouraging
one
another
and
building
one
another
up
just
as
you
are
in
fact
doing
12
Now
we
request
you
brothers
to
show
respect
for
those
who
are
working
hard
among
you
and
presiding
over
you
in
the
Lord
and
admonishing
you
13
and
to
give
them
extraordinary
consideration
in
love
because
of
their
work
Be
peaceable
with
one
another
14
On
the
other
hand
we
urge
you
brothers
to
warn
the
disorderly
speak
consolingly
to
those
who
are
depressed
support
the
weak
be
patient
toward
all
15
See
that
no
one
repays
injury
for
injury
to
anyone
but
always
pursue
what
is
good
toward
one
another
and
to
all
others
16
Always
be
rejoicing
17
Pray
constantly
18
Give
thanks
for
everything
This
is
Gods
will
for
you
in
Christ
Jesus
19
Do
not
put
out
the
fire
of
the
spirit
20
Do
not
treat
prophecies
with
contempt
21
Make
sure
of
all
things
hold
fast
to
what
is
fine
22
Abstain
from
every
form
of
wickedness
23
May
the
God
of
peace
himself
sanctify
you
completely
And
may
the
spirit
and
soul
and
body
of
you
brothers
sound
in
every
respect
be
preserved
blameless
at
the
presence
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
24
The
one
who
is
calling
you
is
faithful
and
he
will
surely
do
so
25
Brothers
keep
praying
for
us
26
Greet
all
the
brothers
with
a
holy
kiss
27
I
am
putting
you
under
the
solemn
obligation
by
the
Lord
to
have
this
letter
read
to
all
the
brothers
28
The
undeserved
kindness
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
you
1
Paul
Silvanus
and
Timothy
to
the
congregation
of
the
Thessalonians
in
union
with
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
2
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
the
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
3
We
are
obligated
always
to
give
thanks
to
God
for
you
brothers
This
is
fitting
because
your
faith
is
growing
exceedingly
and
the
love
of
each
and
every
one
of
you
is
increasing
toward
one
another
4
As
a
result
we
ourselves
take
pride
in
you
among
the
congregations
of
God
because
of
your
endurance
and
faith
in
all
your
persecutions
and
the
hardships
that
you
are
suffering
5
This
is
a
proof
of
the
righteous
judgment
of
God
leading
to
your
being
counted
worthy
of
the
Kingdom
of
God
for
which
you
are
indeed
suffering
6
This
takes
into
account
that
it
is
righteous
on
Gods
part
to
repay
tribulation
to
those
who
make
tribulation
for
you
7
But
you
who
suffer
tribulation
will
be
given
relief
along
with
us
at
the
revelation
of
the
Lord
Jesus
from
heaven
with
his
powerful
angels
8
in
a
flaming
fire
as
he
brings
vengeance
on
those
who
do
not
know
God
and
those
who
do
not
obey
the
good
news
about
our
Lord
Jesus
9
These
very
ones
will
undergo
the
judicial
punishment
of
everlasting
destruction
from
before
the
Lord
and
from
the
glory
of
his
strength
10
at
the
time
when
he
comes
to
be
glorified
in
connection
with
his
holy
ones
and
to
be
regarded
in
that
day
with
wonder
among
all
those
who
exercised
faith
because
the
witness
we
gave
met
with
faith
among
you
11
To
that
very
end
we
always
pray
for
you
that
our
God
may
count
you
worthy
of
his
calling
and
with
his
power
perform
completely
all
the
good
that
he
pleases
and
every
work
of
faith
12
This
is
so
that
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
may
be
glorified
in
you
and
you
in
union
with
him
according
to
the
undeserved
kindness
of
our
God
and
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
1
However
brothers
concerning
the
presence
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
our
being
gathered
together
to
him
we
ask
you
2
not
to
be
quickly
shaken
from
your
reason
nor
to
be
alarmed
either
by
an
inspired
statement
or
by
a
spoken
message
or
by
a
letter
appearing
to
be
from
us
to
the
effect
that
the
day
of
Jehovah
is
here
3
Let
no
one
lead
you
astray
in
any
way
because
it
will
not
come
unless
the
apostasy
comes
first
and
the
man
of
lawlessness
gets
revealed
the
son
of
destruction
4
He
stands
in
opposition
and
exalts
himself
above
every
so-called
god
or
object
of
worship
so
that
he
sits
down
in
the
temple
of
God
publicly
showing
himself
to
be
a
god
5
Do
you
not
remember
that
when
I
was
still
with
you
I
used
to
tell
you
these
things
6
And
now
you
know
what
is
acting
as
a
restraint
so
that
he
will
be
revealed
in
his
own
due
time
7
True
the
mystery
of
this
lawlessness
is
already
at
work
but
only
until
the
one
who
is
right
now
acting
as
a
restraint
is
out
of
the
way
8
Then
indeed
the
lawless
one
will
be
revealed
whom
the
Lord
Jesus
will
do
away
with
by
the
spirit
of
his
mouth
and
bring
to
nothing
by
the
manifestation
of
his
presence
9
But
the
lawless
ones
presence
is
by
the
operation
of
Satan
with
every
powerful
work
and
lying
signs
and
wonders
10
and
every
unrighteous
deception
for
those
who
are
perishing
as
a
retribution
because
they
did
not
accept
the
love
of
the
truth
in
order
that
they
might
be
saved
11
That
is
why
God
lets
a
deluding
influence
mislead
them
so
that
they
may
come
to
believe
the
lie
12
in
order
that
they
all
may
be
judged
because
they
did
not
believe
the
truth
but
took
pleasure
in
unrighteousness
13
However
we
are
obligated
always
to
thank
God
for
you
brothers
loved
by
Jehovah
because
from
the
beginning
God
selected
you
for
salvation
by
sanctifying
you
with
his
spirit
and
by
your
faith
in
the
truth
14
He
called
you
to
this
through
the
good
news
we
declare
so
that
you
may
acquire
the
glory
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
15
So
then
brothers
stand
firm
and
maintain
your
hold
on
the
traditions
that
you
were
taught
whether
it
was
by
a
spoken
message
or
by
a
letter
from
us
16
Moreover
may
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
himself
and
God
our
Father
who
loved
us
and
gave
everlasting
comfort
and
good
hope
by
means
of
undeserved
kindness
17
comfort
your
hearts
and
make
you
firm
in
every
good
deed
and
word
1
Finally
brothers
carry
on
prayer
for
us
that
the
word
of
Jehovah
may
keep
spreading
rapidly
and
being
glorified
just
as
it
is
with
you
2
and
that
we
may
be
rescued
from
harmful
and
wicked
men
for
faith
is
not
a
possession
of
all
people
3
But
the
Lord
is
faithful
and
he
will
strengthen
you
and
protect
you
from
the
wicked
one
4
Moreover
we
have
confidence
in
the
Lord
regarding
you
that
you
are
carrying
out
and
will
go
on
carrying
out
our
instructions
5
May
the
Lord
continue
to
guide
your
hearts
successfully
to
the
love
of
God
and
to
the
endurance
for
the
Christ
6
Now
we
are
giving
you
instructions
brothers
in
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
to
withdraw
from
every
brother
who
is
walking
disorderly
and
not
according
to
the
tradition
that
you
received
from
us
7
For
you
yourselves
know
how
you
should
imitate
us
because
we
did
not
behave
in
a
disorderly
way
among
you
8
nor
did
we
eat
anyones
food
free
On
the
contrary
by
labor
and
toil
we
were
working
night
and
day
so
as
not
to
impose
an
expensive
burden
on
any
one
of
you
9
Not
that
we
do
not
have
authority
but
we
wanted
to
offer
ourselves
as
an
example
for
you
to
imitate
10
In
fact
when
we
were
with
you
we
used
to
give
you
this
order
If
anyone
does
not
want
to
work
neither
let
him
eat
11
For
we
hear
that
some
are
walking
disorderly
among
you
not
working
at
all
but
meddling
with
what
does
not
concern
them
12
To
such
people
we
give
the
order
and
exhortation
in
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
that
they
should
work
quietly
and
eat
food
they
themselves
earn
13
For
your
part
brothers
do
not
give
up
in
doing
good
14
But
if
anyone
is
not
obedient
to
our
word
through
this
letter
keep
this
one
marked
and
stop
associating
with
him
so
that
he
may
become
ashamed
15
And
yet
do
not
consider
him
an
enemy
but
continue
admonishing
him
as
a
brother
16
Now
may
the
Lord
of
peace
himself
give
you
peace
constantly
in
every
way
May
the
Lord
be
with
all
of
you
17
Here
is
my
greeting
Pauls
in
my
own
hand
which
is
a
sign
in
every
letter
this
is
the
way
I
write
18
The
undeserved
kindness
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
all
of
you
1
Paul
an
apostle
of
Christ
Jesus
by
the
command
of
God
our
Savior
and
of
Christ
Jesus
our
hope
2
to
Timothy
a
genuine
child
in
the
faith
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
mercy
and
peace
from
God
the
Father
and
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
3
Just
as
I
encouraged
you
to
stay
in
Ephesus
when
I
was
about
to
go
to
Macedonia
so
I
do
now
in
order
for
you
to
command
certain
ones
not
to
teach
different
doctrine
4
nor
to
pay
attention
to
false
stories
and
to
genealogies
Such
things
end
up
in
nothing
useful
but
merely
give
rise
to
speculations
rather
than
providing
anything
from
God
in
connection
with
faith
5
Really
the
objective
of
this
instruction
is
love
out
of
a
clean
heart
and
out
of
a
good
conscience
and
out
of
faith
without
hypocrisy
6
By
deviating
from
these
things
some
have
been
turned
aside
to
meaningless
talk
7
They
want
to
be
teachers
of
law
but
they
do
not
understand
either
the
things
they
are
saying
or
the
things
they
insist
on
so
strongly
8
Now
we
know
that
the
Law
is
fine
if
one
applies
it
properly
9
recognizing
that
law
is
made
not
for
a
righteous
man
but
for
those
who
are
lawless
and
rebellious
ungodly
and
sinners
disloyal
and
profane
murderers
of
fathers
and
murderers
of
mothers
manslayers
10
sexually
immoral
people
men
who
practice
homosexuality
kidnappers
liars
perjurers
and
everything
else
that
is
in
opposition
to
the
wholesome
teaching
11
according
to
the
glorious
good
news
of
the
happy
God
with
which
I
was
entrusted
12
I
am
grateful
to
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
who
imparted
power
to
me
because
he
considered
me
faithful
by
assigning
me
to
a
ministry
13
although
formerly
I
was
a
blasphemer
and
a
persecutor
and
an
insolent
man
Nevertheless
I
was
shown
mercy
because
I
acted
in
ignorance
and
with
a
lack
of
faith
14
But
the
undeserved
kindness
of
our
Lord
abounded
exceedingly
along
with
faith
and
the
love
that
is
in
Christ
Jesus
15
This
saying
is
trustworthy
and
deserving
of
full
acceptance
Christ
Jesus
came
into
the
world
to
save
sinners
Of
these
I
am
foremost
16
Nevertheless
I
was
shown
mercy
so
that
by
means
of
me
as
the
foremost
case
Christ
Jesus
might
demonstrate
all
his
patience
making
me
an
example
to
those
who
are
going
to
rest
their
faith
on
him
for
everlasting
life
17
Now
to
the
King
of
eternity
incorruptible
invisible
the
only
God
be
honor
and
glory
forever
and
ever
Amen
18
This
instruction
I
entrust
to
you
my
child
Timothy
in
harmony
with
the
prophecies
that
were
made
about
you
that
by
these
you
may
go
on
waging
the
fine
warfare
19
holding
faith
and
a
good
conscience
which
some
have
thrust
aside
resulting
in
the
shipwreck
of
their
faith
20
Hymenaeus
and
Alexander
are
among
these
and
I
have
handed
them
over
to
Satan
so
that
they
may
be
taught
by
discipline
not
to
blaspheme
1
First
of
all
then
I
urge
that
supplications
prayers
intercessions
and
thanksgiving
be
made
concerning
all
sorts
of
men
2
concerning
kings
and
all
those
who
are
in
high
positions
so
that
we
may
go
on
leading
a
calm
and
quiet
life
with
complete
godly
devotion
and
seriousness
3
This
is
fine
and
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
our
Savior
God
4
whose
will
is
that
all
sorts
of
people
should
be
saved
and
come
to
an
accurate
knowledge
of
truth
5
For
there
is
one
God
and
one
mediator
between
God
and
men
a
man
Christ
Jesus
6
who
gave
himself
a
corresponding
ransom
for
all—this
is
what
is
to
be
witnessed
to
in
its
own
due
time
7
For
the
purpose
of
this
witness
I
was
appointed
a
preacher
and
an
apostle—I
am
telling
the
truth
I
am
not
lying—a
teacher
of
nations
in
the
matter
of
faith
and
truth
8
So
I
desire
that
in
every
place
the
men
carry
on
prayer
lifting
up
loyal
hands
without
anger
and
debates
9
Likewise
the
women
should
adorn
themselves
in
appropriate
dress
with
modesty
and
soundness
of
mind
not
with
styles
of
hair
braiding
and
gold
or
pearls
or
very
expensive
clothing
10
but
in
the
way
that
is
proper
for
women
professing
devotion
to
God
namely
through
good
works
11
Let
a
woman
learn
in
silence
with
full
submissiveness
12
I
do
not
permit
a
woman
to
teach
or
to
exercise
authority
over
a
man
but
she
is
to
remain
silent
13
For
Adam
was
formed
first
then
Eve
14
Also
Adam
was
not
deceived
but
the
woman
was
thoroughly
deceived
and
became
a
transgressor
15
However
she
will
be
kept
safe
through
childbearing
provided
she
continues
in
faith
and
love
and
holiness
along
with
soundness
of
mind
1
This
statement
is
trustworthy
If
a
man
is
reaching
out
to
be
an
overseer
he
is
desirous
of
a
fine
work
2
The
overseer
should
therefore
be
irreprehensible
a
husband
of
one
wife
moderate
in
habits
sound
in
mind
orderly
hospitable
qualified
to
teach
3
not
a
drunkard
not
violent
but
reasonable
not
quarrelsome
not
a
lover
of
money
4
a
man
presiding
over
his
own
household
in
a
fine
manner
having
his
children
in
subjection
with
all
seriousness
5
for
if
any
man
does
not
know
how
to
preside
over
his
own
household
how
will
he
care
for
the
congregation
of
God
6
not
a
newly
converted
man
for
fear
that
he
might
get
puffed
up
with
pride
and
fall
into
the
judgment
passed
on
the
Devil
7
Moreover
he
should
also
have
a
fine
testimony
from
outsiders
so
that
he
does
not
fall
into
reproach
and
a
snare
of
the
Devil
8
Ministerial
servants
should
likewise
be
serious
not
double-tongued
not
indulging
in
a
lot
of
wine
not
greedy
of
dishonest
gain
9
holding
the
sacred
secret
of
the
faith
with
a
clean
conscience
10
Also
let
these
be
tested
as
to
fitness
first
then
let
them
serve
as
ministers
as
they
are
free
from
accusation
11
Women
should
likewise
be
serious
not
slanderous
moderate
in
habits
faithful
in
all
things
12
Let
ministerial
servants
be
husbands
of
one
wife
presiding
in
a
fine
manner
over
their
children
and
their
own
households
13
For
the
men
who
minister
in
a
fine
manner
are
acquiring
for
themselves
a
fine
standing
and
great
freeness
of
speech
in
the
faith
that
is
in
Christ
Jesus
14
I
am
writing
you
these
things
though
I
am
hoping
to
come
to
you
shortly
15
but
in
case
I
am
delayed
so
that
you
may
know
how
you
ought
to
conduct
yourself
in
Gods
household
which
is
the
congregation
of
the
living
God
a
pillar
and
support
of
the
truth
16
Indeed
the
sacred
secret
of
this
godly
devotion
is
admittedly
great
He
was
made
manifest
in
flesh
was
declared
righteous
in
spirit
appeared
to
angels
was
preached
about
among
nations
was
believed
upon
in
the
world
was
received
up
in
glory
1
However
the
inspired
word
clearly
says
that
in
later
times
some
will
fall
away
from
the
faith
paying
attention
to
misleading
inspired
statements
and
teachings
of
demons
2
by
means
of
the
hypocrisy
of
men
who
speak
lies
whose
conscience
is
seared
as
with
a
branding
iron
3
They
forbid
marriage
and
command
people
to
abstain
from
foods
that
God
created
to
be
partaken
of
with
thanksgiving
by
those
who
have
faith
and
accurately
know
the
truth
4
For
every
creation
of
God
is
fine
and
nothing
is
to
be
rejected
if
it
is
received
with
thanksgiving
5
for
it
is
sanctified
through
Gods
word
and
prayer
over
it
6
By
giving
this
counsel
to
the
brothers
you
will
be
a
fine
minister
of
Christ
Jesus
one
nourished
with
the
words
of
the
faith
and
of
the
fine
teaching
that
you
have
followed
closely
7
But
reject
irreverent
false
stories
like
those
told
by
old
women
On
the
other
hand
train
yourself
with
godly
devotion
as
your
aim
8
For
physical
training
is
beneficial
for
a
little
but
godly
devotion
is
beneficial
for
all
things
as
it
holds
promise
of
the
life
now
and
the
life
that
is
to
come
9
That
statement
is
trustworthy
and
deserves
full
acceptance
10
This
is
why
we
are
working
hard
and
exerting
ourselves
because
we
have
rested
our
hope
on
a
living
God
who
is
a
Savior
of
all
sorts
of
men
especially
of
faithful
ones
11
Keep
on
giving
these
commands
and
teaching
them
12
Never
let
anyone
look
down
on
your
youth
Instead
become
an
example
to
the
faithful
ones
in
speaking
in
conduct
in
love
in
faith
in
chasteness
13
Until
I
come
continue
applying
yourself
to
public
reading
to
exhortation
to
teaching
14
Do
not
neglect
the
gift
in
you
that
was
given
you
through
a
prophecy
when
the
body
of
elders
laid
their
hands
on
you
15
Ponder
over
these
things
be
absorbed
in
them
so
that
your
advancement
may
be
plainly
seen
by
all
people
16
Pay
constant
attention
to
yourself
and
to
your
teaching
Persevere
in
these
things
for
by
doing
this
you
will
save
both
yourself
and
those
who
listen
to
you
1
Do
not
severely
criticize
an
older
man
On
the
contrary
appeal
to
him
as
a
father
to
younger
men
as
brothers
2
to
older
women
as
mothers
to
younger
women
as
sisters
with
all
chasteness
3
Give
consideration
to
widows
who
are
truly
widows
4
But
if
any
widow
has
children
or
grandchildren
let
these
learn
first
to
practice
godly
devotion
in
their
own
household
and
to
repay
their
parents
and
grandparents
what
is
due
them
for
this
is
acceptable
in
Gods
sight
5
Now
the
woman
who
is
truly
a
widow
and
left
destitute
has
put
her
hope
in
God
and
continues
in
supplications
and
prayers
night
and
day
6
But
the
one
who
gives
herself
to
sensual
gratification
is
dead
though
she
is
living
7
So
keep
on
giving
these
instructions
so
that
they
may
be
irreprehensible
8
Certainly
if
anyone
does
not
provide
for
those
who
are
his
own
and
especially
for
those
who
are
members
of
his
household
he
has
disowned
the
faith
and
is
worse
than
a
person
without
faith
9
A
widow
is
to
be
put
on
the
list
if
she
is
not
less
than
60
years
old
was
the
wife
of
one
husband
10
having
a
reputation
for
fine
works
if
she
raised
children
if
she
practiced
hospitality
if
she
washed
the
feet
of
holy
ones
if
she
assisted
the
afflicted
if
she
devoted
herself
to
every
good
work
11
On
the
other
hand
do
not
put
younger
widows
on
the
list
for
when
their
sexual
desires
come
between
them
and
the
Christ
they
want
to
marry
12
And
they
will
incur
judgment
because
they
have
abandoned
their
first
expression
of
faith
13
At
the
same
time
they
also
learn
to
be
unoccupied
going
around
from
one
house
to
another
yes
not
only
unoccupied
but
also
gossipers
and
meddlers
in
other
peoples
affairs
talking
about
things
they
should
not
14
Therefore
I
desire
the
younger
widows
to
marry
to
bear
children
to
manage
a
household
to
give
no
opportunity
to
the
opposer
to
criticize
15
In
fact
some
have
already
been
turned
aside
to
follow
Satan
16
If
any
believing
woman
has
relatives
who
are
widows
let
her
assist
them
so
that
the
congregation
is
not
burdened
Then
it
can
assist
those
who
are
truly
widows
17
Let
the
elders
who
preside
in
a
fine
way
be
considered
worthy
of
double
honor
especially
those
who
work
hard
in
speaking
and
teaching
18
For
the
scripture
says
You
must
not
muzzle
a
bull
when
it
is
threshing
out
the
grain

also
The
worker
is
worthy
of
his
wages
19
Do
not
accept
an
accusation
against
an
older
man
except
on
the
evidence
of
two
or
three
witnesses
20
Reprove
before
all
onlookers
those
who
practice
sin
as
a
warning
to
the
rest
21
I
solemnly
charge
you
before
God
and
Christ
Jesus
and
the
chosen
angels
to
observe
these
instructions
without
any
prejudice
or
partiality
22
Never
lay
your
hands
hastily
on
any
man
neither
become
a
sharer
in
the
sins
of
others
keep
yourself
chaste
23
Do
not
drink
water
any
longer
but
take
a
little
wine
for
the
sake
of
your
stomach
and
your
frequent
cases
of
sickness
24
The
sins
of
some
men
are
publicly
known
leading
directly
to
judgment
but
those
of
other
men
become
evident
later
25
In
the
same
way
also
the
fine
works
are
publicly
known
and
those
that
are
otherwise
cannot
be
kept
hidden
1
Let
those
who
are
under
the
yoke
of
slavery
keep
on
considering
their
owners
worthy
of
full
honor
so
that
the
name
of
God
and
the
teaching
may
never
be
spoken
of
injuriously
2
Moreover
let
those
having
believing
owners
not
be
disrespectful
to
them
because
they
are
brothers
Rather
they
should
serve
more
readily
because
those
receiving
the
benefit
of
their
good
service
are
believers
and
beloved
Keep
on
teaching
these
things
and
giving
these
exhortations
3
If
any
man
teaches
another
doctrine
and
does
not
agree
with
the
wholesome
instruction
which
is
from
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
nor
with
the
teaching
that
is
in
harmony
with
godly
devotion
4
he
is
puffed
up
with
pride
and
does
not
understand
anything
He
is
obsessed
with
arguments
and
debates
about
words
These
things
give
rise
to
envy
strife
slander
wicked
suspicions
5
constant
disputes
about
minor
matters
by
men
who
are
corrupted
in
mind
and
deprived
of
the
truth
thinking
that
godly
devotion
is
a
means
of
gain
6
To
be
sure
there
is
great
gain
in
godly
devotion
along
with
contentment
7
For
we
have
brought
nothing
into
the
world
and
neither
can
we
carry
anything
out
8
So
having
food
and
clothing
we
will
be
content
with
these
things
9
But
those
who
are
determined
to
be
rich
fall
into
temptation
and
a
snare
and
many
senseless
and
harmful
desires
that
plunge
men
into
destruction
and
ruin
10
For
the
love
of
money
is
a
root
of
all
sorts
of
injurious
things
and
by
reaching
out
for
this
love
some
have
been
led
astray
from
the
faith
and
have
stabbed
themselves
all
over
with
many
pains
11
However
you
O
man
of
God
flee
from
these
things
But
pursue
righteousness
godly
devotion
faith
love
endurance
and
mildness
12
Fight
the
fine
fight
of
the
faith
get
a
firm
hold
on
the
everlasting
life
for
which
you
were
called
and
you
offered
the
fine
public
declaration
in
front
of
many
witnesses
13
Before
God
who
preserves
all
things
alive
and
Christ
Jesus
who
as
a
witness
made
the
fine
public
declaration
before
Pontius
Pilate
I
give
you
orders
14
to
observe
the
commandment
in
a
spotless
and
irreprehensible
way
until
the
manifestation
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
15
which
the
happy
and
only
Potentate
will
show
in
its
own
appointed
times
He
is
the
King
of
those
who
rule
as
kings
and
Lord
of
those
who
rule
as
lords
16
the
one
alone
having
immortality
who
dwells
in
unapproachable
light
whom
no
man
has
seen
or
can
see
To
him
be
honor
and
eternal
might
Amen
17
Instruct
those
who
are
rich
in
the
present
system
of
things
not
to
be
arrogant
and
to
place
their
hope
not
on
uncertain
riches
but
on
God
who
richly
provides
us
with
all
the
things
we
enjoy
18
Tell
them
to
work
at
good
to
be
rich
in
fine
works
to
be
generous
ready
to
share
19
safely
treasuring
up
for
themselves
a
fine
foundation
for
the
future
so
that
they
may
get
a
firm
hold
on
the
real
life
20
Timothy
guard
what
has
been
entrusted
to
you
turning
away
from
the
empty
speeches
that
violate
what
is
holy
and
from
the
contradictions
of
the
falsely
called
knowledge
21
By
making
a
show
of
such
knowledge
some
have
deviated
from
the
faith
May
the
undeserved
kindness
be
with
you
1
Paul
an
apostle
of
Christ
Jesus
by
Gods
will
according
to
the
promise
of
the
life
that
is
through
Christ
Jesus
2
to
Timothy
a
beloved
child
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
mercy
and
peace
from
God
the
Father
and
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
3
I
am
grateful
to
God
to
whom
I
am
rendering
sacred
service
as
my
forefathers
did
and
with
a
clean
conscience
never
ceasing
to
remember
you
in
my
supplications
night
and
day
4
As
I
remember
your
tears
I
am
longing
to
see
you
so
that
I
may
get
filled
with
joy
5
For
I
recall
your
unhypocritical
faith
which
dwelled
first
in
your
grandmother
Lois
and
your
mother
Eunice
but
which
I
am
confident
is
also
in
you
6
For
this
reason
I
remind
you
to
stir
up
like
a
fire
the
gift
of
God
that
is
in
you
through
the
laying
of
my
hands
on
you
7
For
God
did
not
give
us
a
spirit
of
cowardice
but
one
of
power
and
of
love
and
of
soundness
of
mind
8
So
do
not
become
ashamed
either
of
the
witness
about
our
Lord
or
of
me
a
prisoner
for
his
sake
but
take
your
part
in
suffering
adversity
for
the
good
news
by
relying
on
the
power
of
God
9
He
saved
us
and
called
us
with
a
holy
calling
not
because
of
our
works
but
because
of
his
own
purpose
and
undeserved
kindness
This
was
given
to
us
in
connection
with
Christ
Jesus
before
times
long
ago
10
but
now
it
has
been
made
clearly
evident
through
the
manifestation
of
our
Savior
Christ
Jesus
who
has
abolished
death
and
has
shed
light
on
life
and
incorruption
through
the
good
news
11
for
which
I
was
appointed
a
preacher
and
an
apostle
and
a
teacher
12
This
is
why
I
am
also
suffering
these
things
but
I
am
not
ashamed
For
I
know
the
One
whom
I
have
believed
and
I
am
confident
that
he
is
able
to
guard
what
I
have
laid
up
in
trust
with
him
until
that
day
13
Keep
holding
to
the
standard
of
wholesome
words
that
you
heard
from
me
with
the
faith
and
love
that
result
from
union
with
Christ
Jesus
14
Guard
this
fine
trust
by
means
of
the
holy
spirit
which
is
dwelling
in
us
15
You
know
this
that
all
the
men
in
the
province
of
Asia
have
turned
away
from
me
including
Phygelus
and
Hermogenes
16
May
the
Lord
grant
mercy
to
the
household
of
Onesiphorus
for
he
often
refreshed
me
and
he
did
not
become
ashamed
of
my
prison
chains
17
On
the
contrary
when
he
was
in
Rome
he
diligently
looked
for
me
and
found
me
18
May
the
Lord
grant
him
to
find
mercy
from
Jehovah
in
that
day
And
you
well
know
all
the
services
he
rendered
in
Ephesus
1
You
therefore
my
child
keep
on
acquiring
power
in
the
undeserved
kindness
that
is
in
Christ
Jesus
2
and
the
things
you
heard
from
me
that
were
supported
by
many
witnesses
these
things
entrust
to
faithful
men
who
in
turn
will
be
adequately
qualified
to
teach
others
3
As
a
fine
soldier
of
Christ
Jesus
take
your
part
in
suffering
adversity
4
No
man
serving
as
a
soldier
involves
himself
in
the
commercial
businesses
of
life
in
order
to
gain
the
approval
of
the
one
who
enrolled
him
as
a
soldier
5
And
even
in
the
games
anyone
who
competes
is
not
crowned
unless
he
has
competed
according
to
the
rules
6
The
hardworking
farmer
must
be
the
first
to
partake
of
the
fruits
7
Give
constant
thought
to
what
I
am
saying
the
Lord
will
give
you
understanding
in
all
things
8
Remember
that
Jesus
Christ
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
and
was
Davids
offspring
according
to
the
good
news
I
preach
9
for
which
I
am
suffering
and
being
imprisoned
as
a
criminal
Nevertheless
the
word
of
God
is
not
bound
10
For
this
reason
I
go
on
enduring
all
things
for
the
sake
of
the
chosen
ones
so
that
they
too
may
obtain
the
salvation
that
is
through
Christ
Jesus
along
with
everlasting
glory
11
This
saying
is
trustworthy
Certainly
if
we
died
together
we
will
also
live
together
12
if
we
go
on
enduring
we
will
also
rule
together
as
kings
if
we
deny
he
will
also
deny
us
13
if
we
are
unfaithful
he
remains
faithful
for
he
cannot
deny
himself
14
Keep
reminding
them
of
these
things
instructing
them
before
God
not
to
fight
about
words
something
of
no
usefulness
at
all
because
it
harms
those
listening
15
Do
your
utmost
to
present
yourself
approved
to
God
a
workman
with
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
handling
the
word
of
the
truth
aright
16
But
reject
empty
speeches
that
violate
what
is
holy
for
they
will
lead
to
more
and
more
ungodliness
17
and
their
word
will
spread
like
gangrene
Hymenaeus
and
Philetus
are
among
them
18
These
men
have
deviated
from
the
truth
saying
that
the
resurrection
has
already
occurred
and
they
are
subverting
the
faith
of
some
19
Despite
that
the
solid
foundation
of
God
remains
standing
having
this
seal
Jehovah
knows
those
who
belong
to
him

and
Let
everyone
calling
on
the
name
of
Jehovah
renounce
unrighteousness
20
Now
in
a
large
house
there
are
utensils
not
only
of
gold
and
silver
but
also
of
wood
and
earthenware
and
some
for
an
honorable
use
but
others
for
a
use
lacking
honor
21
So
if
anyone
keeps
clear
of
the
latter
ones
he
will
be
an
instrument
for
an
honorable
use
sanctified
useful
to
his
owner
prepared
for
every
good
work
22
So
flee
from
youthful
desires
but
pursue
righteousness
faith
love
peace
along
with
those
who
call
on
the
Lord
out
of
a
clean
heart
23
Further
reject
foolish
and
ignorant
debates
knowing
that
they
produce
fights
24
For
a
slave
of
the
Lord
does
not
need
to
fight
but
needs
to
be
gentle
toward
all
qualified
to
teach
showing
restraint
when
wronged
25
instructing
with
mildness
those
not
favorably
disposed
Perhaps
God
may
give
them
repentance
leading
to
an
accurate
knowledge
of
truth
26
and
they
may
come
to
their
senses
and
escape
from
the
snare
of
the
Devil
seeing
that
they
have
been
caught
alive
by
him
to
do
his
will
1
But
know
this
that
in
the
last
days
critical
times
hard
to
deal
with
will
be
here
2
For
men
will
be
lovers
of
themselves
lovers
of
money
boastful
haughty
blasphemers
disobedient
to
parents
unthankful
disloyal
3
having
no
natural
affection
not
open
to
any
agreement
slanderers
without
self-control
fierce
without
love
of
goodness
4
betrayers
headstrong
puffed
up
with
pride
lovers
of
pleasures
rather
than
lovers
of
God
5
having
an
appearance
of
godliness
but
proving
false
to
its
power
and
from
these
turn
away
6
From
among
these
arise
men
who
slyly
work
their
way
into
households
and
captivate
weak
women
loaded
down
with
sins
led
by
various
desires
7
always
learning
and
yet
never
able
to
come
to
an
accurate
knowledge
of
truth
8
Now
in
the
way
that
Jannes
and
Jambres
opposed
Moses
so
these
also
go
on
opposing
the
truth
Such
men
are
completely
corrupted
in
mind
disapproved
as
regards
the
faith
9
Nevertheless
they
will
make
no
further
progress
for
their
folly
will
be
very
plain
to
all
as
it
was
with
those
two
men
10
But
you
have
closely
followed
my
teaching
my
course
of
life
my
purpose
my
faith
my
patience
my
love
my
endurance
11
the
persecutions
and
sufferings
such
as
I
experienced
in
Antioch
in
Iconium
in
Lystra
I
endured
these
persecutions
and
the
Lord
rescued
me
from
them
all
12
In
fact
all
those
desiring
to
live
with
godly
devotion
in
association
with
Christ
Jesus
will
also
be
persecuted
13
But
wicked
men
and
impostors
will
advance
from
bad
to
worse
misleading
and
being
misled
14
You
however
continue
in
the
things
that
you
learned
and
were
persuaded
to
believe
knowing
from
whom
you
learned
them
15
and
that
from
infancy
you
have
known
the
holy
writings
which
are
able
to
make
you
wise
for
salvation
through
faith
in
Christ
Jesus
16
All
Scripture
is
inspired
of
God
and
beneficial
for
teaching
for
reproving
for
setting
things
straight
for
disciplining
in
righteousness
17
so
that
the
man
of
God
may
be
fully
competent
completely
equipped
for
every
good
work
1
I
solemnly
charge
you
before
God
and
Christ
Jesus
who
is
to
judge
the
living
and
the
dead
and
by
his
manifestation
and
his
Kingdom
2
Preach
the
word
be
at
it
urgently
in
favorable
times
and
difficult
times
reprove
reprimand
exhort
with
all
patience
and
art
of
teaching
3
For
there
will
be
a
period
of
time
when
they
will
not
put
up
with
the
wholesome
teaching
but
according
to
their
own
desires
they
will
surround
themselves
with
teachers
to
have
their
ears
tickled
4
They
will
turn
away
from
listening
to
the
truth
and
give
attention
to
false
stories
5
You
though
keep
your
senses
in
all
things
endure
hardship
do
the
work
of
an
evangelizer
fully
accomplish
your
ministry
6
For
I
am
already
being
poured
out
like
a
drink
offering
and
the
time
for
my
releasing
is
imminent
7
I
have
fought
the
fine
fight
I
have
run
the
race
to
the
finish
I
have
observed
the
faith
8
From
this
time
on
there
is
reserved
for
me
the
crown
of
righteousness
which
the
Lord
the
righteous
judge
will
give
me
as
a
reward
in
that
day
yet
not
to
me
only
but
also
to
all
those
who
have
loved
his
manifestation
9
Do
your
utmost
to
come
to
me
shortly
10
For
Demas
has
forsaken
me
because
he
loved
the
present
system
of
things
and
he
has
gone
to
Thessalonica
Crescens
to
Galatia
Titus
to
Dalmatia
11
Only
Luke
is
with
me
Bring
Mark
along
with
you
for
he
is
helpful
to
me
in
the
ministry
12
But
I
have
sent
Tychicus
off
to
Ephesus
13
When
you
come
bring
the
cloak
I
left
at
Troas
with
Carpus
and
the
scrolls
especially
the
parchments
14
Alexander
the
coppersmith
did
me
a
great
deal
of
harm
Jehovah
will
repay
him
according
to
his
deeds
15
You
too
should
be
on
guard
against
him
for
he
opposed
our
message
to
an
excessive
degree
16
In
my
first
defense
no
one
came
to
my
side
but
they
all
forsook
me—may
they
not
be
held
accountable
17
But
the
Lord
stood
near
me
and
infused
power
into
me
so
that
through
me
the
preaching
might
be
fully
accomplished
and
all
the
nations
might
hear
it
and
I
was
rescued
from
the
lions
mouth
18
The
Lord
will
rescue
me
from
every
wicked
work
and
will
save
me
for
his
heavenly
Kingdom
To
him
be
the
glory
forever
and
ever
Amen
19
Give
my
greetings
to
Prisca
and
Aquila
and
the
household
of
Onesiphorus
20
Erastus
stayed
in
Corinth
but
I
left
Trophimus
sick
at
Miletus
21
Do
your
utmost
to
arrive
before
winter
Eubulus
sends
you
his
greetings
and
so
do
Pudens
and
Linus
and
Claudia
and
all
the
brothers
22
The
Lord
be
with
the
spirit
you
show
His
undeserved
kindness
be
with
you
1
Paul
a
slave
of
God
and
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ
according
to
the
faith
of
Gods
chosen
ones
and
the
accurate
knowledge
of
the
truth
that
is
according
to
godly
devotion
2
and
is
based
on
a
hope
of
the
everlasting
life
that
God
who
cannot
lie
promised
long
ago
3
but
in
his
own
due
time
he
made
his
word
known
through
the
preaching
entrusted
to
me
according
to
the
command
of
our
Savior
God
4
to
Titus
a
genuine
child
according
to
the
faith
we
share
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
the
Father
and
Christ
Jesus
our
Savior
5
I
left
you
in
Crete
so
that
you
would
correct
the
things
that
were
defective
and
make
appointments
of
elders
in
city
after
city
as
I
instructed
you
6
if
there
is
any
man
free
from
accusation
a
husband
of
one
wife
having
believing
children
who
are
not
accused
of
debauchery
or
rebelliousness
7
For
as
Gods
steward
an
overseer
must
be
free
from
accusation
not
self-willed
not
quick-tempered
not
a
drunkard
not
violent
not
greedy
of
dishonest
gain
8
but
hospitable
a
lover
of
goodness
sound
in
mind
righteous
loyal
self-controlled
9
holding
firmly
to
the
faithful
word
as
respects
his
art
of
teaching
so
that
he
may
be
able
both
to
encourage
by
the
teaching
that
is
wholesome
and
to
reprove
those
who
contradict
10
For
there
are
many
rebellious
men
profitless
talkers
and
deceivers
especially
those
who
adhere
to
the
circumcision
11
It
is
necessary
to
shut
their
mouths
because
these
very
men
keep
on
subverting
entire
households
by
teaching
things
they
should
not
for
the
sake
of
dishonest
gain
12
A
certain
one
of
them
their
own
prophet
said
Cretans
are
always
liars
injurious
wild
beasts
idle
gluttons
13
This
witness
is
true
For
this
very
reason
keep
on
reproving
them
with
severity
so
that
they
may
be
healthy
in
the
faith
14
paying
no
attention
to
Jewish
fables
and
commandments
of
men
who
turn
away
from
the
truth
15
All
things
are
clean
to
clean
people
but
to
those
who
are
defiled
and
faithless
nothing
is
clean
for
both
their
minds
and
their
consciences
are
defiled
16
They
publicly
declare
that
they
know
God
but
they
disown
him
by
their
works
because
they
are
detestable
and
disobedient
and
not
approved
for
good
work
of
any
sort
1
You
however
keep
on
speaking
what
is
consistent
with
wholesome
teaching
2
Let
the
older
men
be
moderate
in
habits
serious
sound
in
mind
healthy
in
faith
in
love
in
endurance
3
Likewise
let
the
older
women
be
reverent
in
behavior
not
slanderous
not
enslaved
to
a
lot
of
wine
teachers
of
what
is
good
4
so
that
they
may
advise
the
younger
women
to
love
their
husbands
to
love
their
children
5
to
be
sound
in
mind
chaste
working
at
home
good
subjecting
themselves
to
their
own
husbands
so
that
the
word
of
God
may
not
be
spoken
of
abusively
6
Likewise
keep
on
urging
the
younger
men
to
be
sound
in
mind
7
showing
yourself
to
be
an
example
of
fine
works
in
every
way
Teach
what
is
pure
with
all
seriousness
8
using
wholesome
speech
that
cannot
be
criticized
so
that
those
who
oppose
may
be
put
to
shame
having
nothing
negative
to
say
about
us
9
Let
slaves
be
in
subjection
to
their
owners
in
all
things
trying
to
please
them
not
talking
back
10
not
stealing
from
them
but
showing
complete
trustworthiness
so
that
in
every
way
they
may
adorn
the
teaching
of
our
Savior
God
11
For
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
has
been
manifested
bringing
salvation
to
all
sorts
of
people
12
It
trains
us
to
reject
ungodliness
and
worldly
desires
and
to
live
with
soundness
of
mind
and
righteousness
and
godly
devotion
amid
this
present
system
of
things
13
while
we
wait
for
the
happy
hope
and
glorious
manifestation
of
the
great
God
and
of
our
Savior
Jesus
Christ
14
who
gave
himself
for
us
to
set
us
free
from
every
sort
of
lawlessness
and
to
cleanse
for
himself
a
people
who
are
his
own
special
possession
zealous
for
fine
works
15
Keep
on
speaking
these
things
and
exhorting
and
reproving
with
full
authority
Do
not
let
anyone
look
down
on
you
1
Continue
reminding
them
to
be
in
subjection
and
to
be
obedient
to
governments
and
authorities
to
be
ready
for
every
good
work
2
to
speak
injuriously
of
no
one
not
to
be
quarrelsome
but
to
be
reasonable
displaying
all
mildness
toward
all
men
3
For
we
too
were
once
senseless
disobedient
led
astray
being
slaves
to
various
desires
and
pleasures
carrying
on
in
badness
and
envy
detestable
hating
one
another
4
However
when
the
kindness
of
our
Savior
God
and
his
love
for
mankind
were
manifested
5
not
because
of
any
righteous
works
we
had
done
but
because
of
his
own
mercy
he
saved
us
by
means
of
the
bath
that
brought
us
to
life
and
by
making
us
new
by
holy
spirit
6
He
poured
this
spirit
out
richly
on
us
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Savior
7
so
that
after
being
declared
righteous
through
the
undeserved
kindness
of
that
one
we
might
become
heirs
according
to
a
hope
of
everlasting
life
8
These
words
are
trustworthy
and
I
want
you
to
keep
stressing
these
matters
so
that
those
who
have
believed
God
may
keep
their
minds
focused
on
maintaining
fine
works
These
things
are
fine
and
beneficial
to
men
9
But
have
nothing
to
do
with
foolish
arguments
and
genealogies
and
disputes
and
fights
over
the
Law
for
they
are
unprofitable
and
futile
10
As
for
a
man
who
promotes
a
sect
reject
him
after
a
first
and
a
second
admonition
11
knowing
that
such
a
man
has
deviated
from
the
way
and
is
sinning
and
is
self-condemned
12
When
I
send
Artemas
or
Tychicus
to
you
do
your
utmost
to
come
to
me
at
Nicopolis
for
that
is
where
I
have
decided
to
spend
the
winter
13
Carefully
supply
Zenas
who
is
versed
in
the
Law
and
Apollos
so
that
they
may
lack
nothing
for
their
trip
14
But
let
our
people
also
learn
to
maintain
fine
works
so
as
to
help
in
cases
of
urgent
need
so
that
they
may
not
be
unproductive
15
All
those
with
me
send
you
their
greetings
Give
my
greetings
to
those
who
have
affection
for
us
in
the
faith
May
the
undeserved
kindness
be
with
all
of
you
1
Paul
a
prisoner
for
the
sake
of
Christ
Jesus
and
Timothy
our
brother
to
Philemon
our
beloved
fellow
worker
2
and
to
Apphia
our
sister
and
to
Archippus
our
fellow
soldier
and
to
the
congregation
that
is
in
your
house
3
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
4
I
always
thank
my
God
when
I
mention
you
in
my
prayers
5
as
I
keep
hearing
of
your
faith
and
the
love
that
you
have
for
the
Lord
Jesus
and
for
all
the
holy
ones
6
I
pray
that
your
sharing
in
the
faith
may
move
you
to
acknowledge
every
good
thing
that
we
have
through
Christ
7
For
I
received
much
joy
and
comfort
on
hearing
of
your
love
because
the
hearts
of
the
holy
ones
have
been
refreshed
through
you
brother
8
For
this
very
reason
though
I
have
great
freeness
of
speech
in
connection
with
Christ
to
order
you
to
do
what
is
proper
9
I
would
rather
appeal
to
you
on
the
basis
of
love
seeing
that
I
am
Paul
an
older
man
yes
now
also
a
prisoner
for
the
sake
of
Christ
Jesus
10
I
am
appealing
to
you
for
my
child
whose
father
I
became
while
in
prison
Onesimus
11
He
was
formerly
useless
to
you
but
now
he
is
useful
to
you
and
to
me
12
I
am
sending
him
back
to
you
yes
him
my
very
own
heart
13
I
would
like
to
keep
him
here
for
myself
so
that
he
might
take
your
place
in
ministering
to
me
during
my
imprisonment
for
the
sake
of
the
good
news
14
But
I
do
not
want
to
do
anything
without
your
consent
so
that
your
good
deed
may
be
done
not
under
compulsion
but
of
your
own
free
will
15
Perhaps
this
is
really
why
he
broke
away
for
a
short
while
so
that
you
may
have
him
back
forever
16
no
longer
as
a
slave
but
as
more
than
a
slave
as
a
brother
who
is
beloved
especially
so
to
me
but
how
much
more
so
to
you
both
in
the
flesh
and
in
the
Lord
17
So
if
you
consider
me
a
friend
receive
him
kindly
the
same
way
you
would
me
18
Moreover
if
he
did
you
any
wrong
or
owes
you
anything
charge
it
to
my
account
19
I
Paul
am
writing
with
my
own
hand
I
will
pay
it
back—not
to
mention
that
you
owe
me
even
your
own
self
20
Yes
brother
may
I
receive
this
assistance
from
you
in
connection
with
the
Lord
refresh
my
heart
in
connection
with
Christ
21
I
am
confident
that
you
will
comply
so
I
am
writing
you
knowing
that
you
will
do
even
more
than
what
I
say
22
But
along
with
that
also
prepare
a
place
for
me
to
stay
for
I
am
hoping
that
through
your
prayers
I
will
be
given
back
to
you
23
Sending
you
greetings
is
Epaphras
my
fellow
captive
in
union
with
Christ
Jesus
24
also
Mark
Aristarchus
Demas
and
Luke
my
fellow
workers
25
The
undeserved
kindness
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
the
spirit
you
show
1
Long
ago
God
spoke
to
our
forefathers
by
means
of
the
prophets
on
many
occasions
and
in
many
ways
2
Now
at
the
end
of
these
days
he
has
spoken
to
us
by
means
of
a
Son
whom
he
appointed
heir
of
all
things
and
through
whom
he
made
the
systems
of
things
3
He
is
the
reflection
of
Gods
glory
and
the
exact
representation
of
his
very
being
and
he
sustains
all
things
by
the
word
of
his
power
And
after
he
had
made
a
purification
for
our
sins
he
sat
down
at
the
right
hand
of
the
Majesty
on
high
4
So
he
has
become
better
than
the
angels
to
the
extent
that
he
has
inherited
a
name
more
excellent
than
theirs
5
For
example
to
which
one
of
the
angels
did
God
ever
say
You
are
my
son
today
I
have
become
your
father
And
again
I
will
become
his
father
and
he
will
become
my
son
6
But
when
he
again
brings
his
Firstborn
into
the
inhabited
earth
he
says
And
let
all
of
Gods
angels
do
obeisance
to
him
7
Also
he
says
about
the
angels
He
makes
his
angels
spirits
and
his
ministers
a
flame
of
fire
8
But
about
the
Son
he
says
God
is
your
throne
forever
and
ever
and
the
scepter
of
your
Kingdom
is
the
scepter
of
uprightness
9
You
loved
righteousness
and
you
hated
lawlessness
That
is
why
God
your
God
anointed
you
with
the
oil
of
exultation
more
than
your
companions
10
And
At
the
beginning
O
Lord
you
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
and
the
heavens
are
the
works
of
your
hands
11
They
will
perish
but
you
will
remain
and
just
like
a
garment
they
will
all
wear
out
12
and
you
will
wrap
them
up
just
as
a
cloak
as
a
garment
and
they
will
be
changed
But
you
are
the
same
and
your
years
will
never
come
to
an
end
13
But
about
which
of
the
angels
has
he
ever
said
Sit
at
my
right
hand
until
I
place
your
enemies
as
a
stool
for
your
feet
14
Are
they
not
all
spirits
for
holy
service
sent
out
to
minister
for
those
who
are
going
to
inherit
salvation
1
That
is
why
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
pay
more
than
the
usual
attention
to
the
things
we
have
heard
so
that
we
never
drift
away
2
For
if
the
word
spoken
through
angels
proved
to
be
sure
and
every
transgression
and
disobedient
act
received
a
punishment
in
harmony
with
justice
3
how
will
we
escape
if
we
have
neglected
so
great
a
salvation
For
it
began
to
be
spoken
through
our
Lord
and
was
verified
for
us
by
those
who
heard
him
4
while
God
joined
in
bearing
witness
with
signs
and
wonders
and
various
powerful
works
and
with
the
holy
spirit
distributed
according
to
his
will
5
For
it
is
not
to
angels
that
he
has
subjected
the
inhabited
earth
to
come
about
which
we
are
speaking
6
But
in
one
place
a
certain
witness
said
What
is
man
that
you
keep
him
in
mind
or
a
son
of
man
that
you
take
care
of
him
7
You
made
him
a
little
lower
than
angels
you
crowned
him
with
glory
and
honor
and
appointed
him
over
the
works
of
your
hands
8
All
things
you
subjected
under
his
feet
By
subjecting
all
things
to
him
God
left
nothing
that
is
not
subject
to
him
Now
though
we
do
not
yet
see
all
things
in
subjection
to
him
9
But
we
do
see
Jesus
who
was
made
a
little
lower
than
angels
now
crowned
with
glory
and
honor
for
having
suffered
death
so
that
by
Gods
undeserved
kindness
he
might
taste
death
for
everyone
10
For
it
was
fitting
that
the
one
for
whom
and
through
whom
all
things
exist
in
bringing
many
sons
to
glory
should
make
the
Chief
Agent
of
their
salvation
perfect
through
sufferings
11
For
both
the
one
who
is
sanctifying
and
those
who
are
being
sanctified
all
stem
from
one
and
for
this
reason
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
them
brothers
12
as
he
says
I
will
declare
your
name
to
my
brothers
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
I
will
praise
you
with
song
13
And
again
I
will
put
my
trust
in
him
And
again
Look
I
and
the
young
children
whom
Jehovah
gave
me
14
Therefore
since
the
young
children
are
sharers
of
blood
and
flesh
he
also
similarly
shared
in
the
same
things
so
that
through
his
death
he
might
bring
to
nothing
the
one
having
the
means
to
cause
death
that
is
the
Devil
15
and
that
he
might
set
free
all
those
who
were
held
in
slavery
all
their
lives
by
their
fear
of
death
16
For
it
is
not
really
angels
he
is
assisting
but
he
is
assisting
Abrahams
offspring
17
Consequently
he
had
to
become
like
his
brothers
in
all
respects
so
that
he
could
become
a
merciful
and
faithful
high
priest
in
things
relating
to
God
in
order
to
offer
a
propitiatory
sacrifice
for
the
sins
of
the
people
18
Since
he
himself
has
suffered
when
being
put
to
the
test
he
is
able
to
come
to
the
aid
of
those
who
are
being
put
to
the
test
1
Consequently
holy
brothers
partakers
of
the
heavenly
calling
consider
the
apostle
and
high
priest
whom
we
acknowledge—Jesus
2
He
was
faithful
to
the
One
who
appointed
him
just
as
Moses
also
was
in
all
the
house
of
that
One
3
For
he
is
counted
worthy
of
more
glory
than
Moses
since
the
one
who
constructs
a
house
has
more
honor
than
the
house
itself
4
Of
course
every
house
is
constructed
by
someone
but
the
one
who
constructed
all
things
is
God
5
Now
Moses
was
faithful
as
an
attendant
in
all
the
house
of
that
One
as
a
testimony
of
the
things
that
were
to
be
spoken
afterward
6
but
Christ
was
faithful
as
a
son
over
Gods
house
We
are
His
house
if
indeed
we
hold
on
firmly
to
our
freeness
of
speech
and
the
hope
of
which
we
boast
down
to
the
end
7
Therefore
just
as
the
holy
spirit
says
Today
if
you
listen
to
his
voice
8
do
not
harden
your
hearts
as
on
the
occasion
of
provoking
to
bitter
anger
as
in
the
day
of
testing
in
the
wilderness
9
where
your
forefathers
put
me
to
the
test
and
tried
me
despite
seeing
my
works
for
40
years
10
This
is
why
I
became
disgusted
with
this
generation
and
said
They
always
go
astray
in
their
hearts
and
they
have
not
come
to
know
my
ways
11
So
I
swore
in
my
anger
They
will
not
enter
into
my
rest
12
Beware
brothers
for
fear
there
should
ever
develop
in
any
one
of
you
a
wicked
heart
lacking
faith
by
drawing
away
from
the
living
God
13
but
keep
on
encouraging
one
another
each
day
as
long
as
it
is
called
Today

so
that
none
of
you
should
become
hardened
by
the
deceptive
power
of
sin
14
For
we
actually
become
partakers
of
the
Christ
only
if
we
hold
firmly
down
to
the
end
the
confidence
we
had
at
the
beginning
15
As
it
is
said
Today
if
you
listen
to
his
voice
do
not
harden
your
hearts
as
on
the
occasion
of
provoking
to
bitter
anger
16
For
who
heard
and
yet
provoked
him
to
bitter
anger
Was
it
not
in
fact
all
those
who
went
out
of
Egypt
under
Moses
17
Moreover
with
whom
did
God
become
disgusted
for
40
years
Was
it
not
with
those
who
sinned
whose
dead
bodies
fell
in
the
wilderness
18
And
to
whom
did
he
swear
that
they
would
not
enter
into
his
rest
Was
it
not
to
those
who
acted
disobediently
19
So
we
see
that
they
could
not
enter
in
because
of
lack
of
faith
1
Therefore
since
a
promise
of
entering
into
his
rest
remains
let
us
be
on
guard
for
fear
someone
among
you
seems
to
fall
short
of
it
2
For
we
have
also
had
the
good
news
declared
to
us
just
as
they
had
but
the
word
that
they
heard
did
not
benefit
them
because
they
were
not
united
by
faith
with
those
who
listened
3
For
we
who
have
exercised
faith
do
enter
into
the
rest
just
as
he
has
said
So
I
swore
in
my
anger
They
will
not
enter
into
my
rest

although
his
works
were
finished
from
the
founding
of
the
world
4
For
in
one
place
he
has
said
of
the
seventh
day
as
follows
And
God
rested
on
the
seventh
day
from
all
his
works

5
and
here
again
he
says
They
will
not
enter
into
my
rest
6
Therefore
since
it
remains
for
some
to
enter
into
it
and
those
to
whom
the
good
news
was
first
declared
did
not
enter
in
because
of
disobedience
7
he
again
marks
off
a
certain
day
by
saying
long
afterward
in
Davids
psalm
Today
just
as
it
has
been
said
above
Today
if
you
listen
to
his
voice
do
not
harden
your
hearts
8
For
if
Joshua
had
led
them
into
a
place
of
rest
God
would
not
afterward
have
spoken
of
another
day
9
So
there
remains
a
sabbath-rest
for
the
people
of
God
10
For
the
man
who
has
entered
into
Gods
rest
has
also
rested
from
his
own
works
just
as
God
did
from
his
own
11
Let
us
therefore
do
our
utmost
to
enter
into
that
rest
so
that
no
one
may
fall
into
the
same
pattern
of
disobedience
12
For
the
word
of
God
is
alive
and
exerts
power
and
is
sharper
than
any
two-edged
sword
and
pierces
even
to
the
dividing
of
soul
and
spirit
and
of
joints
from
the
marrow
and
is
able
to
discern
thoughts
and
intentions
of
the
heart
13
And
there
is
not
a
creation
that
is
hidden
from
his
sight
but
all
things
are
naked
and
openly
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
the
one
to
whom
we
must
give
an
account
14
Therefore
since
we
have
a
great
high
priest
who
has
passed
through
the
heavens
Jesus
the
Son
of
God
let
us
hold
on
to
our
public
declaration
of
him
15
For
we
do
not
have
a
high
priest
who
cannot
sympathize
with
our
weaknesses
but
we
have
one
who
has
been
tested
in
all
respects
as
we
have
but
without
sin
16
Let
us
then
approach
the
throne
of
undeserved
kindness
with
freeness
of
speech
so
that
we
may
receive
mercy
and
find
undeserved
kindness
to
help
us
at
the
right
time
1
For
every
high
priest
taken
from
among
men
is
appointed
in
their
behalf
over
the
things
relating
to
God
so
that
he
may
offer
gifts
and
sacrifices
for
sins
2
He
is
able
to
deal
compassionately
with
the
ignorant
and
erring
ones
since
he
too
is
confronted
with
his
own
weakness
3
and
because
of
that
he
must
make
offerings
for
his
own
sins
just
as
he
does
for
those
of
the
people
4
A
man
does
not
take
this
honor
of
his
own
accord
but
he
receives
it
only
when
he
is
called
by
God
just
as
Aaron
was
5
So
too
the
Christ
did
not
glorify
himself
by
becoming
a
high
priest
but
was
glorified
by
the
One
who
said
to
him
You
are
my
son
today
I
have
become
your
father
6
As
he
also
says
in
another
place
You
are
a
priest
forever
in
the
manner
of
Melchizedek
7
During
his
life
on
earth
Christ
offered
up
supplications
and
also
petitions
with
strong
outcries
and
tears
to
the
One
who
was
able
to
save
him
out
of
death
and
he
was
favorably
heard
for
his
godly
fear
8
Although
he
was
a
son
he
learned
obedience
from
the
things
he
suffered
9
And
after
he
had
been
made
perfect
he
became
responsible
for
everlasting
salvation
to
all
those
obeying
him
10
because
he
has
been
designated
by
God
a
high
priest
in
the
manner
of
Melchizedek
11
We
have
much
to
say
about
him
and
it
is
difficult
to
explain
because
you
have
become
dull
in
your
hearing
12
For
although
by
now
you
should
be
teachers
you
again
need
someone
to
teach
you
from
the
beginning
the
elementary
things
of
the
sacred
pronouncements
of
God
and
you
have
gone
back
to
needing
milk
not
solid
food
13
For
everyone
who
continues
to
feed
on
milk
is
unacquainted
with
the
word
of
righteousness
for
he
is
a
young
child
14
But
solid
food
belongs
to
mature
people
to
those
who
through
use
have
their
powers
of
discernment
trained
to
distinguish
both
right
and
wrong
1
Therefore
now
that
we
have
moved
beyond
the
primary
doctrine
about
the
Christ
let
us
press
on
to
maturity
not
laying
a
foundation
again
namely
repentance
from
dead
works
and
faith
in
God
2
the
teaching
on
baptisms
and
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
everlasting
judgment
3
And
this
we
will
do
if
God
indeed
permits
4
For
as
regards
those
who
were
once
enlightened
and
who
have
tasted
the
heavenly
free
gift
and
who
have
become
partakers
of
holy
spirit
5
and
who
have
tasted
the
fine
word
of
God
and
powers
of
the
coming
system
of
things
6
but
have
fallen
away
it
is
impossible
to
revive
them
again
to
repentance
because
they
nail
the
Son
of
God
to
the
stake
again
for
themselves
and
expose
him
to
public
shame
7
For
the
ground
receives
a
blessing
from
God
when
it
drinks
in
the
rain
that
frequently
falls
on
it
and
then
produces
vegetation
useful
to
those
for
whom
it
is
cultivated
8
But
if
it
produces
thorns
and
thistles
it
is
rejected
and
is
near
to
being
cursed
and
in
the
end
it
will
be
burned
9
But
in
your
case
beloved
ones
we
are
convinced
of
better
things
things
related
to
salvation
even
though
we
are
speaking
in
this
way
10
For
God
is
not
unrighteous
so
as
to
forget
your
work
and
the
love
you
showed
for
his
name
by
ministering
and
continuing
to
minister
to
the
holy
ones
11
But
we
desire
each
one
of
you
to
show
the
same
industriousness
so
as
to
have
the
full
assurance
of
the
hope
down
to
the
end
12
so
that
you
may
not
become
sluggish
but
be
imitators
of
those
who
through
faith
and
patience
inherit
the
promises
13
For
when
God
made
his
promise
to
Abraham
since
he
could
not
swear
by
anyone
greater
he
swore
by
himself
14
saying
I
will
surely
bless
you
and
I
will
surely
multiply
you
15
So
after
Abraham
had
shown
patience
he
obtained
this
promise
16
For
men
swear
by
someone
greater
and
their
oath
is
the
end
of
every
dispute
since
it
is
a
legal
guarantee
to
them
17
In
this
same
way
when
God
decided
to
demonstrate
more
clearly
to
the
heirs
of
the
promise
the
unchangeableness
of
his
purpose
he
guaranteed
it
with
an
oath
18
in
order
that
through
two
unchangeable
things
in
which
it
is
impossible
for
God
to
lie
we
who
have
fled
to
the
refuge
may
have
strong
encouragement
to
take
firm
hold
of
the
hope
set
before
us
19
We
have
this
hope
as
an
anchor
for
the
soul
both
sure
and
firm
and
it
enters
in
within
the
curtain
20
where
a
forerunner
has
entered
in
our
behalf
Jesus
who
has
become
a
high
priest
in
the
manner
of
Melchizedek
forever
1
For
this
Melchizedek
king
of
Salem
priest
of
the
Most
High
God
met
Abraham
returning
from
the
slaughter
of
the
kings
and
blessed
him
2
and
Abraham
gave
him
a
tenth
of
everything
First
his
name
is
translated
King
of
Righteousness

and
then
also
king
of
Salem
that
is
King
of
Peace
3
In
being
fatherless
motherless
without
genealogy
having
neither
a
beginning
of
days
nor
an
end
of
life
but
being
made
like
the
Son
of
God
he
remains
a
priest
for
all
time
4
See
how
great
this
man
was
to
whom
Abraham
the
family
head
gave
a
tenth
out
of
the
best
spoils
5
True
according
to
the
Law
those
of
the
sons
of
Levi
who
receive
their
priestly
office
have
a
commandment
to
collect
tithes
from
the
people
that
is
from
their
brothers
even
though
these
are
descendants
of
Abraham
6
But
this
man
who
did
not
trace
his
genealogy
from
them
took
tithes
from
Abraham
and
blessed
the
one
who
had
the
promises
7
Now
it
is
undeniable
that
the
lesser
one
is
blessed
by
the
greater
8
And
in
the
one
case
it
is
men
who
are
dying
who
receive
tithes
but
in
the
other
case
it
is
someone
of
whom
witness
is
given
that
he
lives
9
And
it
could
be
said
that
even
Levi
who
receives
tithes
has
paid
tithes
through
Abraham
10
for
he
was
still
a
future
descendant
of
his
forefather
when
Melchizedek
met
him
11
If
then
perfection
was
attainable
through
the
Levitical
priesthood
for
it
was
a
feature
of
the
Law
that
was
given
to
the
people
what
further
need
would
there
be
for
another
priest
to
arise
who
is
said
to
be
in
the
manner
of
Melchizedek
and
not
in
the
manner
of
Aaron
12
For
since
the
priesthood
is
being
changed
it
becomes
necessary
to
change
the
Law
as
well
13
For
the
man
about
whom
these
things
are
said
came
from
another
tribe
from
which
no
one
has
officiated
at
the
altar
14
For
it
is
clear
that
our
Lord
has
descended
from
Judah
yet
Moses
said
nothing
about
priests
coming
from
that
tribe
15
And
this
becomes
even
clearer
when
another
priest
arises
who
is
like
Melchizedek
16
who
has
become
such
not
by
the
legal
requirement
that
depends
on
fleshly
descent
but
by
the
power
of
an
indestructible
life
17
For
it
is
said
in
witness
of
him
You
are
a
priest
forever
in
the
manner
of
Melchizedek
18
So
then
the
former
commandment
is
set
aside
because
it
is
weak
and
ineffective
19
For
the
Law
made
nothing
perfect
but
the
introduction
of
a
better
hope
did
through
which
we
are
drawing
near
to
God
20
Also
inasmuch
as
this
was
not
done
without
an
oath
being
sworn
21
for
indeed
there
are
men
who
have
become
priests
without
a
sworn
oath
but
this
one
has
become
so
through
an
oath
sworn
respecting
him
by
the
One
who
said
Jehovah
has
sworn
and
he
will
not
change
his
mind
You
are
a
priest
forever
22
Jesus
has
accordingly
become
the
guarantee
of
a
better
covenant
23
Furthermore
many
had
to
become
priests
in
succession
because
death
prevented
them
from
continuing
as
such
24
but
because
he
continues
alive
forever
his
priesthood
has
no
successors
25
So
he
is
able
also
to
save
completely
those
who
are
approaching
God
through
him
because
he
is
always
alive
to
plead
for
them
26
For
it
is
fitting
for
us
to
have
such
a
high
priest
who
is
loyal
innocent
undefiled
separated
from
the
sinners
and
exalted
above
the
heavens
27
Unlike
those
high
priests
he
does
not
need
to
offer
up
sacrifices
daily
first
for
his
own
sins
and
then
for
those
of
the
people
because
he
did
this
once
for
all
time
when
he
offered
himself
up
28
For
the
Law
appoints
as
high
priests
men
who
have
weaknesses
but
the
word
of
the
oath
sworn
after
the
Law
appoints
a
son
who
has
been
made
perfect
forever
1
Now
this
is
the
main
point
of
what
we
are
saying
We
have
such
a
high
priest
as
this
and
he
has
sat
down
at
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
the
Majesty
in
the
heavens
2
a
minister
of
the
holy
place
and
of
the
true
tent
which
Jehovah
set
up
and
not
man
3
For
every
high
priest
is
appointed
to
offer
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
so
it
was
necessary
for
this
one
also
to
have
something
to
offer
4
If
he
were
on
earth
he
would
not
be
a
priest
since
there
are
already
men
who
offer
the
gifts
according
to
the
Law
5
These
men
are
offering
sacred
service
in
a
typical
representation
and
a
shadow
of
the
heavenly
things
just
as
Moses
when
about
to
construct
the
tent
was
given
the
divine
command
For
He
says
See
that
you
make
all
things
after
their
pattern
that
was
shown
to
you
in
the
mountain
6
But
now
Jesus
has
obtained
a
more
excellent
ministry
because
he
is
also
the
mediator
of
a
correspondingly
better
covenant
which
has
been
legally
established
on
better
promises
7
If
that
first
covenant
had
been
faultless
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
a
second
8
For
he
does
find
fault
with
the
people
when
he
says
Look
The
days
are
coming

says
Jehovah
when
I
will
make
with
the
house
of
Israel
and
with
the
house
of
Judah
a
new
covenant
9
It
will
not
be
like
the
covenant
that
I
made
with
their
forefathers
on
the
day
I
took
hold
of
their
hand
to
lead
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
because
they
did
not
remain
in
my
covenant
so
I
stopped
caring
for
them

says
Jehovah
10
For
this
is
the
covenant
that
I
will
make
with
the
house
of
Israel
after
those
days

says
Jehovah
I
will
put
my
laws
in
their
mind
and
in
their
hearts
I
will
write
them
And
I
will
become
their
God
and
they
will
become
my
people
11
And
they
will
no
longer
teach
each
one
his
fellow
citizen
and
each
one
his
brother
saying
Know
Jehovah
For
they
will
all
know
me
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
of
them
12
For
I
will
be
merciful
toward
their
unrighteous
deeds
and
I
will
no
longer
call
their
sins
to
mind
13
In
his
saying
a
new
covenant

he
has
made
the
former
one
obsolete
Now
what
is
obsolete
and
growing
old
is
near
to
vanishing
away
1
For
its
part
the
former
covenant
used
to
have
legal
requirements
for
sacred
service
and
its
holy
place
on
earth
2
For
a
first
tent
compartment
was
constructed
in
which
were
the
lampstand
and
the
table
and
the
display
of
the
loaves
of
presentation
and
it
is
called
the
Holy
Place
3
But
behind
the
second
curtain
was
the
tent
compartment
called
the
Most
Holy
4
This
had
a
golden
censer
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
completely
overlaid
with
gold
in
which
were
the
golden
jar
containing
the
manna
and
Aarons
rod
that
budded
and
the
tablets
of
the
covenant
5
and
above
it
were
the
glorious
cherubs
overshadowing
the
propitiatory
cover
But
now
is
not
the
time
to
speak
of
these
things
in
detail
6
After
these
things
were
constructed
this
way
the
priests
enter
the
first
tent
compartment
regularly
to
perform
the
sacred
services
7
but
the
high
priest
enters
alone
into
the
second
compartment
once
a
year
not
without
blood
which
he
offers
for
himself
and
for
the
sins
that
the
people
committed
in
ignorance
8
Thus
the
holy
spirit
makes
it
clear
that
the
way
into
the
holy
place
had
not
yet
been
revealed
while
the
first
tent
was
standing
9
This
tent
is
an
illustration
for
the
present
time
and
according
to
this
arrangement
both
gifts
and
sacrifices
are
offered
However
these
are
not
able
to
make
the
conscience
of
the
man
doing
sacred
service
perfect
10
They
have
to
do
only
with
foods
and
drinks
and
various
ceremonial
washings
They
were
legal
requirements
concerning
the
body
and
were
imposed
until
the
appointed
time
to
set
things
straight
11
However
when
Christ
came
as
a
high
priest
of
the
good
things
that
have
already
taken
place
he
passed
through
the
greater
and
more
perfect
tent
not
made
with
hands
that
is
not
of
this
creation
12
He
entered
into
the
holy
place
not
with
the
blood
of
goats
and
of
young
bulls
but
with
his
own
blood
once
for
all
time
and
obtained
an
everlasting
deliverance
for
us
13
For
if
the
blood
of
goats
and
of
bulls
and
the
ashes
of
a
heifer
sprinkled
on
those
who
have
been
defiled
sanctifies
for
the
cleansing
of
the
flesh
14
how
much
more
will
the
blood
of
the
Christ
who
through
an
everlasting
spirit
offered
himself
without
blemish
to
God
cleanse
our
consciences
from
dead
works
so
that
we
may
render
sacred
service
to
the
living
God
15
That
is
why
he
is
a
mediator
of
a
new
covenant
in
order
that
because
a
death
has
occurred
for
their
release
by
ransom
from
the
transgressions
under
the
former
covenant
those
who
have
been
called
may
receive
the
promise
of
the
everlasting
inheritance
16
For
where
there
is
a
covenant
the
death
of
the
human
covenanter
needs
to
be
established
17
because
a
covenant
is
valid
at
death
since
it
is
not
in
force
as
long
as
the
human
covenanter
is
living
18
Consequently
neither
was
the
former
covenant
put
into
effect
without
blood
19
For
when
Moses
had
spoken
every
commandment
of
the
Law
to
all
the
people
he
took
the
blood
of
the
young
bulls
and
of
the
goats
with
water
scarlet
wool
and
hyssop
and
sprinkled
the
book
and
all
the
people
20
saying
This
is
the
blood
of
the
covenant
that
God
has
commanded
you
to
keep
21
He
likewise
sprinkled
the
tent
and
all
the
vessels
of
the
holy
service
with
the
blood
22
Yes
according
to
the
Law
nearly
all
things
are
cleansed
with
blood
and
unless
blood
is
poured
out
no
forgiveness
takes
place
23
Therefore
it
was
necessary
for
the
typical
representations
of
the
things
in
the
heavens
to
be
cleansed
by
these
means
but
the
heavenly
things
require
far
better
sacrifices
24
For
Christ
did
not
enter
into
a
holy
place
made
with
hands
which
is
a
copy
of
the
reality
but
into
heaven
itself
so
that
he
now
appears
before
God
on
our
behalf
25
This
was
not
done
to
offer
himself
often
as
when
the
high
priest
enters
into
the
holy
place
from
year
to
year
with
blood
that
is
not
his
own
26
Otherwise
he
would
have
to
suffer
often
from
the
founding
of
the
world
But
now
he
has
manifested
himself
once
for
all
time
at
the
conclusion
of
the
systems
of
things
to
do
away
with
sin
through
the
sacrifice
of
himself
27
And
just
as
it
is
reserved
for
men
to
die
once
for
all
time
but
after
this
to
receive
a
judgment
28
so
also
the
Christ
was
offered
once
for
all
time
to
bear
the
sins
of
many
and
the
second
time
that
he
appears
it
will
be
apart
from
sin
and
he
will
be
seen
by
those
earnestly
looking
for
him
for
their
salvation
1
For
since
the
Law
has
a
shadow
of
the
good
things
to
come
but
not
the
very
substance
of
the
things
it
can
never
by
the
same
sacrifices
that
are
continually
offered
year
after
year
make
those
who
approach
perfect
2
Otherwise
would
not
the
sacrifices
have
stopped
being
offered
because
those
rendering
sacred
service
once
cleansed
would
have
no
consciousness
of
sins
anymore
3
On
the
contrary
these
sacrifices
are
a
reminder
of
sins
year
after
year
4
for
it
is
not
possible
for
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
to
take
sins
away
5
So
when
he
comes
into
the
world
he
says
Sacrifice
and
offering
you
did
not
want
but
you
prepared
a
body
for
me
6
You
did
not
approve
of
whole
burnt
offerings
and
sin
offerings
7
Then
I
said
Look
I
have
come
in
the
scroll
it
is
written
about
me
to
do
your
will
O
God
8
After
first
saying
You
did
not
want
nor
did
you
approve
of
sacrifices
and
offerings
and
whole
burnt
offerings
and
sin
offerings—sacrifices
that
are
offered
according
to
the
Law—
9
then
he
says
Look
I
have
come
to
do
your
will
He
does
away
with
what
is
first
in
order
to
establish
what
is
second
10
By
this
will
we
have
been
sanctified
through
the
offering
of
the
body
of
Jesus
Christ
once
for
all
time
11
Also
every
priest
takes
his
station
day
after
day
to
offer
holy
service
and
to
make
the
same
sacrifices
often
which
can
never
take
sins
away
completely
12
But
this
man
offered
one
sacrifice
for
sins
for
all
time
and
sat
down
at
the
right
hand
of
God
13
from
then
on
waiting
until
his
enemies
should
be
placed
as
a
stool
for
his
feet
14
For
it
is
by
one
sacrificial
offering
that
he
has
made
those
who
are
being
sanctified
perfect
for
all
time
15
Moreover
the
holy
spirit
also
bears
witness
to
us
for
after
it
has
said
16
This
is
the
covenant
that
I
will
make
with
them
after
those
days

says
Jehovah
I
will
put
my
laws
in
their
hearts
and
in
their
minds
I
will
write
them
17
Then
it
says
And
I
will
no
longer
call
their
sins
and
their
lawless
deeds
to
mind
18
Now
where
there
is
forgiveness
of
these
there
is
no
longer
an
offering
for
sin
19
Therefore
brothers
since
we
have
boldness
for
the
way
of
entry
into
the
holy
place
by
the
blood
of
Jesus
20
which
he
opened
up
for
us
as
a
new
and
living
way
through
the
curtain
that
is
his
flesh
21
and
since
we
have
a
great
priest
over
the
house
of
God
22
let
us
approach
with
sincere
hearts
and
complete
faith
having
had
our
hearts
sprinkled
clean
from
a
wicked
conscience
and
our
bodies
bathed
with
clean
water
23
Let
us
hold
firmly
the
public
declaration
of
our
hope
without
wavering
for
the
one
who
promised
is
faithful
24
And
let
us
consider
one
another
so
as
to
incite
to
love
and
fine
works
25
not
forsaking
our
meeting
together
as
some
have
the
custom
but
encouraging
one
another
and
all
the
more
so
as
you
see
the
day
drawing
near
26
For
if
we
practice
sin
willfully
after
having
received
the
accurate
knowledge
of
the
truth
there
is
no
longer
any
sacrifice
for
sins
left
27
but
there
is
a
certain
fearful
expectation
of
judgment
and
a
burning
indignation
that
is
going
to
consume
those
in
opposition
28
Anyone
who
has
disregarded
the
Law
of
Moses
dies
without
compassion
on
the
testimony
of
two
or
three
29
How
much
greater
punishment
do
you
think
a
person
will
deserve
who
has
trampled
on
the
Son
of
God
and
who
has
regarded
as
of
ordinary
value
the
blood
of
the
covenant
by
which
he
was
sanctified
and
who
has
outraged
the
spirit
of
undeserved
kindness
with
contempt
30
For
we
know
the
One
who
said
Vengeance
is
mine
I
will
repay
And
again
Jehovah
will
judge
his
people
31
It
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
God
32
However
keep
remembering
the
former
days
in
which
after
you
were
enlightened
you
endured
a
great
struggle
along
with
sufferings
33
At
times
you
were
publicly
exposed
both
to
reproaches
and
to
tribulations
and
at
times
you
shared
with
those
who
were
having
such
an
experience
34
For
you
expressed
sympathy
for
those
in
prison
and
you
accepted
joyfully
the
plundering
of
your
belongings
knowing
that
you
yourselves
have
a
better
and
an
enduring
possession
35
Therefore
do
not
throw
away
your
boldness
which
will
be
richly
rewarded
36
For
you
need
endurance
so
that
after
you
have
done
the
will
of
God
you
may
receive
the
fulfillment
of
the
promise
37
For
yet
a
very
little
while

and
the
one
who
is
coming
will
arrive
and
will
not
delay
38
But
my
righteous
one
will
live
by
reason
of
faith

and
if
he
shrinks
back
I
have
no
pleasure
in
him
39
Now
we
are
not
the
sort
who
shrink
back
to
destruction
but
the
sort
who
have
faith
for
the
preserving
of
our
lives
1
Faith
is
the
assured
expectation
of
what
is
hoped
for
the
evident
demonstration
of
realities
that
are
not
seen
2
For
by
means
of
it
the
men
of
ancient
times
had
witness
borne
to
them
3
By
faith
we
perceive
that
the
systems
of
things
were
put
in
order
by
Gods
word
so
that
what
is
seen
has
come
into
existence
from
things
that
are
not
visible
4
By
faith
Abel
offered
God
a
sacrifice
of
greater
worth
than
that
of
Cain
and
through
that
faith
he
received
the
witness
that
he
was
righteous
for
God
approved
his
gifts
and
although
he
died
he
still
speaks
through
his
faith
5
By
faith
Enoch
was
transferred
so
as
not
to
see
death
and
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
because
God
had
transferred
him
for
before
he
was
transferred
he
received
the
witness
that
he
had
pleased
God
well
6
Moreover
without
faith
it
is
impossible
to
please
God
well
for
whoever
approaches
God
must
believe
that
he
is
and
that
he
becomes
the
rewarder
of
those
earnestly
seeking
him
7
By
faith
Noah
after
receiving
divine
warning
of
things
not
yet
seen
showed
godly
fear
and
constructed
an
ark
for
the
saving
of
his
household
and
through
this
faith
he
condemned
the
world
and
he
became
an
heir
of
the
righteousness
that
results
from
faith
8
By
faith
Abraham
when
he
was
called
obeyed
by
going
out
to
a
place
he
was
to
receive
as
an
inheritance
he
went
out
although
not
knowing
where
he
was
going
9
By
faith
he
lived
as
a
foreigner
in
the
land
of
the
promise
as
in
a
foreign
land
living
in
tents
with
Isaac
and
Jacob
the
heirs
with
him
of
the
very
same
promise
10
For
he
was
awaiting
the
city
having
real
foundations
whose
designer
and
builder
is
God
11
By
faith
also
Sarah
received
power
to
conceive
offspring
even
when
she
was
past
the
age
since
she
considered
Him
faithful
who
made
the
promise
12
For
this
reason
from
one
man
who
was
as
good
as
dead
there
were
born
children
as
many
as
the
stars
of
heaven
in
number
and
as
innumerable
as
the
sands
by
the
seaside
13
In
faith
all
of
these
died
although
they
did
not
receive
the
fulfillment
of
the
promises
but
they
saw
them
from
a
distance
and
welcomed
them
and
publicly
declared
that
they
were
strangers
and
temporary
residents
in
the
land
14
For
those
who
speak
in
such
a
way
make
it
evident
that
they
are
earnestly
seeking
a
place
of
their
own
15
And
yet
if
they
had
kept
remembering
the
place
from
which
they
had
departed
they
would
have
had
opportunity
to
return
16
But
now
they
are
reaching
out
for
a
better
place
that
is
one
belonging
to
heaven
Therefore
God
is
not
ashamed
of
them
to
be
called
on
as
their
God
for
he
has
prepared
a
city
for
them
17
By
faith
Abraham
when
he
was
tested
as
good
as
offered
up
Isaac—the
man
who
had
gladly
received
the
promises
attempted
to
offer
up
his
only-begotten
son—
18
although
it
had
been
said
to
him
What
will
be
called
your
offspring
will
be
through
Isaac
19
But
he
reasoned
that
God
was
able
to
raise
him
up
even
from
the
dead
and
he
did
receive
him
from
there
in
an
illustrative
way
20
By
faith
also
Isaac
blessed
Jacob
and
Esau
concerning
things
to
come
21
By
faith
Jacob
when
about
to
die
blessed
each
of
the
sons
of
Joseph
and
worshipped
while
leaning
on
the
top
of
his
staff
22
By
faith
Joseph
nearing
his
end
spoke
of
the
exodus
of
the
sons
of
Israel
and
he
gave
instructions
concerning
his
bones
23
By
faith
Moses
was
hid
by
his
parents
for
three
months
after
his
birth
because
they
saw
that
the
young
child
was
beautiful
and
they
did
not
fear
the
order
of
the
king
24
By
faith
Moses
when
grown
up
refused
to
be
called
the
son
of
Pharaohs
daughter
25
choosing
to
be
mistreated
with
the
people
of
God
rather
than
to
have
the
temporary
enjoyment
of
sin
26
because
he
considered
the
reproach
of
the
Christ
to
be
riches
greater
than
the
treasures
of
Egypt
for
he
looked
intently
toward
the
payment
of
the
reward
27
By
faith
he
left
Egypt
but
not
fearing
the
anger
of
the
king
for
he
continued
steadfast
as
seeing
the
One
who
is
invisible
28
By
faith
he
observed
the
Passover
and
the
splashing
of
the
blood
so
that
the
destroyer
might
not
harm
their
firstborn
29
By
faith
they
passed
through
the
Red
Sea
as
on
dry
land
but
when
the
Egyptians
attempted
it
they
were
swallowed
up
30
By
faith
the
walls
of
Jericho
fell
down
after
the
people
had
marched
around
them
for
seven
days
31
By
faith
Rahab
the
prostitute
did
not
perish
with
those
who
acted
disobediently
because
she
received
the
spies
in
a
peaceable
way
32
And
what
more
will
I
say
For
time
will
fail
me
if
I
go
on
to
relate
about
Gideon
Barak
Samson
Jephthah
David
as
well
as
Samuel
and
the
other
prophets
33
Through
faith
they
defeated
kingdoms
brought
about
righteousness
obtained
promises
stopped
the
mouths
of
lions
34
quenched
the
force
of
fire
escaped
the
edge
of
the
sword
from
a
weak
state
were
made
powerful
became
mighty
in
war
routed
invading
armies
35
Women
received
their
dead
by
resurrection
but
other
men
were
tortured
because
they
would
not
accept
release
by
some
ransom
in
order
that
they
might
attain
a
better
resurrection
36
Yes
others
received
their
trial
by
mockings
and
scourgings
indeed
more
than
that
by
chains
and
prisons
37
They
were
stoned
they
were
tried
they
were
sawn
in
two
they
were
slaughtered
by
the
sword
they
went
about
in
sheepskins
in
goatskins
while
they
were
in
need
in
tribulation
mistreated
38
and
the
world
was
not
worthy
of
them
They
wandered
about
in
deserts
and
mountains
and
caves
and
dens
of
the
earth
39
And
yet
all
of
these
although
they
received
a
favorable
witness
because
of
their
faith
did
not
obtain
the
fulfillment
of
the
promise
40
because
God
had
foreseen
something
better
for
us
so
that
they
might
not
be
made
perfect
apart
from
us
1
So
then
because
we
have
such
a
great
cloud
of
witnesses
surrounding
us
let
us
also
throw
off
every
weight
and
the
sin
that
easily
entangles
us
and
let
us
run
with
endurance
the
race
that
is
set
before
us
2
as
we
look
intently
at
the
Chief
Agent
and
Perfecter
of
our
faith
Jesus
For
the
joy
that
was
set
before
him
he
endured
a
torture
stake
despising
shame
and
has
sat
down
at
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
of
God
3
Indeed
consider
closely
the
one
who
has
endured
such
hostile
speech
from
sinners
against
their
own
interests
so
that
you
may
not
get
tired
and
give
up
4
In
your
struggle
against
that
sin
you
have
never
yet
resisted
to
the
point
of
having
your
blood
shed
5
And
you
have
entirely
forgotten
the
exhortation
that
addresses
you
as
sons
My
son
do
not
belittle
the
discipline
from
Jehovah
nor
give
up
when
you
are
corrected
by
him
6
for
those
whom
Jehovah
loves
he
disciplines
in
fact
he
scourges
everyone
whom
he
receives
as
a
son
7
You
need
to
endure
as
part
of
your
discipline
God
is
treating
you
as
sons
For
what
son
is
not
disciplined
by
his
father
8
But
if
you
have
not
all
shared
in
receiving
this
discipline
you
are
really
illegitimate
children
and
not
sons
9
Furthermore
our
human
fathers
used
to
discipline
us
and
we
gave
them
respect
Should
we
not
more
readily
submit
ourselves
to
the
Father
of
our
spiritual
life
and
live
10
For
they
disciplined
us
for
a
short
time
according
to
what
seemed
good
to
them
but
he
does
so
for
our
benefit
so
that
we
may
partake
of
his
holiness
11
True
no
discipline
seems
for
the
present
to
be
joyous
but
it
is
painful
yet
afterward
it
yields
the
peaceable
fruit
of
righteousness
to
those
who
have
been
trained
by
it
12
Therefore
strengthen
the
hands
that
hang
down
and
the
feeble
knees
13
and
keep
making
straight
paths
for
your
feet
so
that
what
is
lame
may
not
be
put
out
of
joint
but
rather
may
be
healed
14
Pursue
peace
with
all
people
and
the
sanctification
without
which
no
man
will
see
the
Lord
15
Carefully
watch
that
no
one
fails
to
obtain
the
undeserved
kindness
of
God
so
that
no
poisonous
root
springs
up
to
cause
trouble
and
many
are
defiled
by
it
16
and
watch
that
among
you
there
is
no
one
who
is
sexually
immoral
nor
anyone
who
does
not
appreciate
sacred
things
like
Esau
who
gave
up
his
rights
as
firstborn
in
exchange
for
one
meal
17
For
you
know
that
afterward
when
he
wanted
to
inherit
the
blessing
he
was
rejected
for
although
he
earnestly
tried
to
bring
about
a
change
of
mind
with
tears
it
was
to
no
avail
18
For
you
have
not
approached
something
that
can
be
felt
and
that
has
been
set
aflame
with
fire
and
a
dark
cloud
and
thick
darkness
and
a
storm
19
and
the
blast
of
a
trumpet
and
the
voice
speaking
words
which
on
hearing
the
people
begged
that
nothing
further
should
be
spoken
to
them
20
For
they
could
not
bear
the
command
If
even
a
beast
touches
the
mountain
it
must
be
stoned
21
Also
the
display
was
so
terrifying
that
Moses
said
I
am
afraid
and
trembling
22
But
you
have
approached
a
Mount
Zion
and
a
city
of
the
living
God
heavenly
Jerusalem
and
myriads
of
angels
23
in
general
assembly
and
the
congregation
of
the
firstborn
who
have
been
enrolled
in
the
heavens
and
God
the
Judge
of
all
and
the
spiritual
lives
of
righteous
ones
who
have
been
made
perfect
24
and
Jesus
the
mediator
of
a
new
covenant
and
the
sprinkled
blood
which
speaks
in
a
better
way
than
Abels
blood
25
See
that
you
do
not
refuse
to
listen
to
the
one
who
is
speaking
For
if
those
who
refused
to
listen
to
the
one
giving
divine
warning
on
earth
did
not
escape
how
much
more
will
we
not
escape
if
we
turn
away
from
him
who
speaks
from
the
heavens
26
At
that
time
his
voice
shook
the
earth
but
now
he
has
promised
Yet
once
more
I
will
shake
not
only
the
earth
but
also
the
heaven
27
Now
the
expression
yet
once
more
indicates
the
removal
of
the
things
that
are
shaken
things
that
have
been
made
in
order
that
the
things
not
shaken
may
remain
28
Therefore
seeing
that
we
are
to
receive
a
Kingdom
that
cannot
be
shaken
let
us
continue
to
receive
undeserved
kindness
through
which
we
may
acceptably
offer
God
sacred
service
with
godly
fear
and
awe
29
For
our
God
is
a
consuming
fire
1
Let
your
brotherly
love
continue
2
Do
not
forget
hospitality
for
through
it
some
unknowingly
entertained
angels
3
Keep
in
mind
those
in
prison
as
though
you
were
imprisoned
with
them
and
those
being
mistreated
since
you
yourselves
also
are
in
the
body
4
Let
marriage
be
honorable
among
all
and
let
the
marriage
bed
be
without
defilement
for
God
will
judge
sexually
immoral
people
and
adulterers
5
Let
your
way
of
life
be
free
of
the
love
of
money
while
you
are
content
with
the
present
things
For
he
has
said
I
will
never
leave
you
and
I
will
never
abandon
you
6
So
that
we
may
be
of
good
courage
and
say
Jehovah
is
my
helper
I
will
not
be
afraid
What
can
man
do
to
me
7
Remember
those
who
are
taking
the
lead
among
you
who
have
spoken
the
word
of
God
to
you
and
as
you
contemplate
how
their
conduct
turns
out
imitate
their
faith
8
Jesus
Christ
is
the
same
yesterday
and
today
and
forever
9
Do
not
be
led
astray
by
various
and
strange
teachings
for
it
is
better
for
the
heart
to
be
strengthened
by
undeserved
kindness
than
by
foods
which
do
not
benefit
those
occupied
with
them
10
We
have
an
altar
from
which
those
who
offer
sacred
service
at
the
tent
have
no
authority
to
eat
11
For
the
bodies
of
those
animals
whose
blood
is
taken
into
the
holy
place
as
a
sin
offering
by
the
high
priest
are
burned
up
outside
the
camp
12
Therefore
Jesus
also
suffered
outside
the
city
gate
in
order
to
sanctify
the
people
with
his
own
blood
13
Let
us
then
go
to
him
outside
the
camp
bearing
the
reproach
he
bore
14
for
we
do
not
have
here
a
city
that
remains
but
we
are
earnestly
seeking
the
one
to
come
15
Through
him
let
us
always
offer
to
God
a
sacrifice
of
praise
that
is
the
fruit
of
our
lips
that
make
public
declaration
to
his
name
16
Moreover
do
not
forget
to
do
good
and
to
share
what
you
have
with
others
for
God
is
well-pleased
with
such
sacrifices
17
Be
obedient
to
those
who
are
taking
the
lead
among
you
and
be
submissive
for
they
are
keeping
watch
over
you
as
those
who
will
render
an
account
so
that
they
may
do
this
with
joy
and
not
with
sighing
for
this
would
be
damaging
to
you
18
Keep
praying
for
us
for
we
trust
we
have
an
honest
conscience
as
we
wish
to
conduct
ourselves
honestly
in
all
things
19
But
I
especially
urge
you
to
pray
so
that
I
may
be
restored
to
you
the
sooner
20
Now
may
the
God
of
peace
who
brought
up
from
the
dead
the
great
shepherd
of
the
sheep
our
Lord
Jesus
with
the
blood
of
an
everlasting
covenant
21
equip
you
with
every
good
thing
to
do
his
will
working
in
us
through
Jesus
Christ
what
is
well-pleasing
in
his
sight
to
whom
be
the
glory
forever
and
ever
Amen
22
Now
I
urge
you
brothers
to
listen
patiently
to
this
word
of
encouragement
for
I
have
written
you
a
short
letter
23
I
want
you
to
know
that
our
brother
Timothy
has
been
released
If
he
comes
soon
I
will
be
with
him
when
I
see
you
24
Give
my
greetings
to
all
those
who
are
taking
the
lead
among
you
and
to
all
the
holy
ones
Those
in
Italy
send
you
their
greetings
25
The
undeserved
kindness
be
with
all
of
you
1
James
a
slave
of
God
and
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
to
the
12
tribes
that
are
scattered
about
Greetings
2
Consider
it
all
joy
my
brothers
when
you
meet
with
various
trials
3
knowing
as
you
do
that
this
tested
quality
of
your
faith
produces
endurance
4
But
let
endurance
complete
its
work
so
that
you
may
be
complete
and
sound
in
all
respects
not
lacking
in
anything
5
So
if
any
one
of
you
is
lacking
in
wisdom
let
him
keep
asking
God
for
he
gives
generously
to
all
and
without
reproaching
and
it
will
be
given
him
6
But
let
him
keep
asking
in
faith
not
doubting
at
all
for
the
one
who
doubts
is
like
a
wave
of
the
sea
driven
by
the
wind
and
blown
about
7
In
fact
that
man
should
not
expect
to
receive
anything
from
Jehovah
8
he
is
an
indecisive
man
unsteady
in
all
his
ways
9
But
let
the
lowly
brother
rejoice
over
his
exaltation
10
and
the
rich
one
over
his
humiliation
because
like
a
flower
of
the
field
he
will
pass
away
11
For
just
as
the
sun
rises
with
its
scorching
heat
and
withers
the
plant
and
its
flower
falls
off
and
its
outward
beauty
perishes
so
too
the
rich
man
will
fade
away
in
the
midst
of
his
pursuits
12
Happy
is
the
man
who
keeps
on
enduring
trial
because
on
becoming
approved
he
will
receive
the
crown
of
life
which
Jehovah
promised
to
those
who
continue
loving
Him
13
When
under
trial
let
no
one
say
I
am
being
tried
by
God
For
with
evil
things
God
cannot
be
tried
nor
does
he
himself
try
anyone
14
But
each
one
is
tried
by
being
drawn
out
and
enticed
by
his
own
desire
15
Then
the
desire
when
it
has
become
fertile
gives
birth
to
sin
in
turn
sin
when
it
has
been
carried
out
brings
forth
death
16
Do
not
be
misled
my
beloved
brothers
17
Every
good
gift
and
every
perfect
present
is
from
above
coming
down
from
the
Father
of
the
celestial
lights
who
does
not
vary
or
change
like
the
shifting
shadows
18
It
was
his
will
to
bring
us
forth
by
the
word
of
truth
so
that
we
would
become
a
kind
of
firstfruits
of
his
creatures
19
Know
this
my
beloved
brothers
Everyone
must
be
quick
to
listen
slow
to
speak
slow
to
anger
20
for
mans
anger
does
not
bring
about
Gods
righteousness
21
Therefore
put
away
all
filthiness
and
every
trace
of
badness
and
accept
with
mildness
the
implanting
of
the
word
that
is
able
to
save
you
22
However
become
doers
of
the
word
and
not
hearers
only
deceiving
yourselves
with
false
reasoning
23
For
if
anyone
is
a
hearer
of
the
word
and
not
a
doer
this
one
is
like
a
man
looking
at
his
own
face
in
a
mirror
24
For
he
looks
at
himself
and
he
goes
away
and
immediately
forgets
what
sort
of
person
he
is
25
But
the
one
who
peers
into
the
perfect
law
that
belongs
to
freedom
and
continues
in
it
has
become
not
a
forgetful
hearer
but
a
doer
of
the
work
and
he
will
be
happy
in
what
he
does
26
If
any
man
thinks
he
is
a
worshipper
of
God
but
does
not
keep
a
tight
rein
on
his
tongue
he
is
deceiving
his
own
heart
and
his
worship
is
futile
27
The
form
of
worship
that
is
clean
and
undefiled
from
the
standpoint
of
our
God
and
Father
is
this
to
look
after
orphans
and
widows
in
their
tribulation
and
to
keep
oneself
without
spot
from
the
world
1
My
brothers
you
are
not
holding
to
the
faith
of
our
glorious
Lord
Jesus
Christ
while
showing
favoritism
are
you
2
For
if
a
man
with
gold
rings
on
his
fingers
and
in
splendid
clothing
comes
into
your
meeting
but
a
poor
man
in
filthy
clothing
also
enters
3
do
you
look
with
favor
on
the
one
wearing
the
splendid
clothing
and
say
You
take
this
seat
here
in
a
fine
place

and
do
you
say
to
the
poor
one
You
keep
standing
or
Take
that
seat
there
under
my
footstool
4
If
so
do
you
not
have
class
distinctions
among
yourselves
and
have
you
not
become
judges
rendering
wicked
decisions
5
Listen
my
beloved
brothers
Did
not
God
choose
those
who
are
poor
from
the
worlds
standpoint
to
be
rich
in
faith
and
heirs
of
the
Kingdom
which
he
promised
to
those
who
love
him
6
But
you
have
dishonored
the
poor
Is
it
not
the
rich
who
oppress
you
and
drag
you
before
law
courts
7
Do
they
not
blaspheme
the
fine
name
by
which
you
were
called
8
If
now
you
carry
out
the
royal
law
according
to
the
scripture
You
must
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself

you
are
doing
quite
well
9
But
if
you
continue
showing
favoritism
you
are
committing
sin
and
you
are
convicted
by
the
law
as
transgressors
10
For
if
anyone
obeys
all
the
Law
but
makes
a
false
step
in
one
point
he
has
become
an
offender
against
all
of
it
11
For
the
one
who
said
You
must
not
commit
adultery

also
said
You
must
not
murder
If
now
you
do
not
commit
adultery
but
you
do
murder
you
have
become
a
transgressor
of
law
12
Keep
on
speaking
and
behaving
in
such
a
way
as
those
do
who
are
going
to
be
judged
by
the
law
of
a
free
people
13
For
the
one
who
does
not
practice
mercy
will
have
his
judgment
without
mercy
Mercy
triumphs
over
judgment
14
Of
what
benefit
is
it
my
brothers
if
someone
says
he
has
faith
but
he
does
not
have
works
That
faith
cannot
save
him
can
it
15
If
a
brother
or
a
sister
is
lacking
clothing
and
enough
food
for
the
day
16
yet
one
of
you
says
to
them
Go
in
peace
keep
warm
and
well
fed

but
you
do
not
give
them
what
they
need
for
their
body
of
what
benefit
is
it
17
So
too
faith
by
itself
without
works
is
dead
18
Nevertheless
someone
will
say
You
have
faith
and
I
have
works
Show
me
your
faith
without
the
works
and
I
will
show
you
my
faith
by
my
works
19
You
believe
that
there
is
one
God
do
you
You
are
doing
quite
well
And
yet
the
demons
believe
and
shudder
20
But
do
you
care
to
know
O
empty
man
that
faith
without
works
is
useless
21
Was
not
Abraham
our
father
declared
righteous
by
works
after
he
offered
up
Isaac
his
son
on
the
altar
22
You
see
that
his
faith
was
active
along
with
his
works
and
his
faith
was
perfected
by
his
works
23
and
the
scripture
was
fulfilled
that
says
Abraham
put
faith
in
Jehovah
and
it
was
counted
to
him
as
righteousness

and
he
came
to
be
called
Jehovahs
friend
24
You
see
that
a
man
is
to
be
declared
righteous
by
works
and
not
by
faith
alone
25
In
the
same
manner
was
not
Rahab
the
prostitute
also
declared
righteous
by
works
after
she
received
the
messengers
hospitably
and
sent
them
out
by
another
way
26
Indeed
just
as
the
body
without
spirit
is
dead
so
also
faith
without
works
is
dead
1
Not
many
of
you
should
become
teachers
my
brothers
knowing
that
we
will
receive
heavier
judgment
2
For
we
all
stumble
many
times
If
anyone
does
not
stumble
in
word
he
is
a
perfect
man
able
to
bridle
also
his
whole
body
3
If
we
put
bridles
in
the
mouths
of
horses
to
make
them
obey
us
we
guide
also
their
whole
body
4
Look
also
at
ships
Although
they
are
so
big
and
are
driven
by
strong
winds
they
are
steered
by
a
very
small
rudder
wherever
the
man
at
the
helm
is
inclined
to
go
5
So
too
the
tongue
is
a
small
part
of
the
body
and
yet
it
makes
great
brags
See
how
small
a
fire
it
takes
to
set
a
great
forest
ablaze
6
The
tongue
is
also
a
fire
The
tongue
represents
a
world
of
unrighteousness
among
our
body
members
for
it
defiles
all
the
body
and
sets
the
whole
course
of
life
on
fire
and
it
is
set
on
fire
by
Gehenna
7
For
every
kind
of
wild
animal
and
bird
and
reptile
and
sea
creature
is
to
be
tamed
and
has
been
tamed
by
humans
8
But
no
human
can
tame
the
tongue
It
is
unruly
and
injurious
full
of
deadly
poison
9
With
it
we
praise
Jehovah
the
Father
and
yet
with
it
we
curse
men
who
have
come
into
existence
in
the
likeness
of
God
10
Out
of
the
same
mouth
come
blessing
and
cursing
My
brothers
it
is
not
right
for
things
to
happen
this
way
11
A
spring
does
not
cause
the
fresh
water
and
the
bitter
water
to
bubble
out
of
the
same
opening
does
it
12
My
brothers
a
fig
tree
cannot
produce
olives
or
a
grapevine
figs
can
it
Neither
can
salt
water
produce
fresh
water
13
Who
is
wise
and
understanding
among
you
Let
him
by
his
fine
conduct
demonstrate
works
performed
with
a
mildness
that
comes
from
wisdom
14
But
if
you
have
bitter
jealousy
and
contentiousness
in
your
hearts
do
not
be
bragging
and
lying
against
the
truth
15
This
is
not
the
wisdom
that
comes
down
from
above
it
is
earthly
animalistic
demonic
16
For
wherever
there
are
jealousy
and
contentiousness
there
will
also
be
disorder
and
every
vile
thing
17
But
the
wisdom
from
above
is
first
of
all
pure
then
peaceable
reasonable
ready
to
obey
full
of
mercy
and
good
fruits
impartial
not
hypocritical
18
Moreover
the
fruit
of
righteousness
is
sown
in
peaceful
conditions
for
those
who
are
making
peace
1
What
is
the
source
of
the
wars
and
fights
among
you
Do
they
not
originate
from
your
fleshly
desires
that
carry
on
a
conflict
within
you
2
You
desire
and
yet
you
do
not
have
You
go
on
murdering
and
coveting
and
yet
you
are
not
able
to
obtain
You
go
on
fighting
and
waging
war
You
do
not
have
because
of
your
not
asking
3
When
you
do
ask
you
do
not
receive
because
you
are
asking
for
a
wrong
purpose
so
that
you
may
spend
it
on
your
fleshly
desires
4
Adulteresses
do
you
not
know
that
friendship
with
the
world
is
enmity
with
God
Whoever
therefore
wants
to
be
a
friend
of
the
world
is
making
himself
an
enemy
of
God
5
Or
do
you
think
that
for
no
reason
the
scripture
says
The
spirit
that
has
taken
up
residence
within
us
keeps
enviously
longing
6
However
the
undeserved
kindness
that
He
gives
is
greater
So
it
says
God
opposes
the
haughty
ones
but
he
gives
undeserved
kindness
to
the
humble
ones
7
Therefore
subject
yourselves
to
God
but
oppose
the
Devil
and
he
will
flee
from
you
8
Draw
close
to
God
and
he
will
draw
close
to
you
Cleanse
your
hands
you
sinners
and
purify
your
hearts
you
indecisive
ones
9
Give
way
to
misery
and
mourn
and
weep
Let
your
laughter
be
turned
into
mourning
and
your
joy
into
despair
10
Humble
yourselves
in
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
and
he
will
exalt
you
11
Stop
speaking
against
one
another
brothers
Whoever
speaks
against
a
brother
or
judges
his
brother
speaks
against
law
and
judges
law
Now
if
you
judge
law
you
are
not
a
doer
of
law
but
a
judge
12
There
is
only
one
who
is
Lawgiver
and
Judge
the
one
who
is
able
to
save
and
to
destroy
But
you
who
are
you
to
be
judging
your
neighbor
13
Come
now
you
who
say
Today
or
tomorrow
we
will
travel
to
this
city
and
will
spend
a
year
there
and
we
will
do
business
and
make
some
profit

14
whereas
you
do
not
know
what
your
life
will
be
like
tomorrow
For
you
are
a
mist
that
appears
for
a
little
while
and
then
disappears
15
Instead
you
should
say
If
Jehovah
wills
we
will
live
and
do
this
or
that
16
But
now
you
take
pride
in
your
arrogant
boasting
All
such
boasting
is
wicked
17
Therefore
if
someone
knows
how
to
do
what
is
right
and
yet
does
not
do
it
it
is
a
sin
for
him
1
Come
now
you
rich
men
weep
and
wail
over
the
miseries
that
are
coming
upon
you
2
Your
riches
have
rotted
and
your
clothing
has
become
moth-eaten
3
Your
gold
and
silver
have
rusted
away
and
their
rust
will
be
a
witness
against
you
and
will
consume
your
flesh
What
you
have
stored
up
will
be
like
a
fire
in
the
last
days
4
Look
The
wages
you
have
withheld
from
the
workers
who
harvested
your
fields
keep
crying
out
and
the
cries
for
help
of
the
reapers
have
reached
the
ears
of
Jehovah
of
armies
5
You
have
lived
in
luxury
and
for
self-gratification
on
the
earth
You
have
fattened
your
hearts
on
the
day
of
slaughter
6
You
have
condemned
you
have
murdered
the
righteous
one
Is
he
not
opposing
you
7
Be
patient
then
brothers
until
the
presence
of
the
Lord
Look
The
farmer
keeps
waiting
for
the
precious
fruit
of
the
earth
exercising
patience
over
it
until
the
early
rain
and
the
late
rain
arrive
8
You
too
exercise
patience
make
your
hearts
firm
because
the
presence
of
the
Lord
has
drawn
close
9
Do
not
grumble
against
one
another
brothers
so
that
you
do
not
get
judged
Look
The
Judge
is
standing
before
the
doors
10
Brothers
take
as
a
pattern
of
the
suffering
of
evil
and
the
exercising
of
patience
the
prophets
who
spoke
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
11
Look
We
consider
happy
those
who
have
endured
You
have
heard
of
the
endurance
of
Job
and
have
seen
the
outcome
Jehovah
gave
that
Jehovah
is
very
tender
in
affection
and
merciful
12
Above
all
my
brothers
stop
swearing
either
by
heaven
or
by
earth
or
by
any
other
oath
But
let
your
Yes
mean
yes
and
your
No

no
so
that
you
do
not
become
liable
to
judgment
13
Is
there
anyone
suffering
hardship
among
you
Let
him
carry
on
prayer
Is
there
anyone
in
good
spirits
Let
him
sing
psalms
14
Is
there
anyone
sick
among
you
Let
him
call
the
elders
of
the
congregation
to
him
and
let
them
pray
over
him
applying
oil
to
him
in
the
name
of
Jehovah
15
And
the
prayer
of
faith
will
make
the
sick
one
well
and
Jehovah
will
raise
him
up
Also
if
he
has
committed
sins
he
will
be
forgiven
16
Therefore
openly
confess
your
sins
to
one
another
and
pray
for
one
another
so
that
you
may
be
healed
A
righteous
mans
supplication
has
a
powerful
effect
17
Elijah
was
a
man
with
feelings
like
ours
and
yet
when
he
prayed
earnestly
for
it
not
to
rain
it
did
not
rain
on
the
land
for
three
years
and
six
months
18
Then
he
prayed
again
and
the
heaven
gave
rain
and
the
land
produced
fruit
19
My
brothers
if
anyone
among
you
is
led
astray
from
the
truth
and
another
turns
him
back
20
know
that
whoever
turns
a
sinner
back
from
the
error
of
his
way
will
save
him
from
death
and
will
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
1
Peter
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ
to
the
temporary
residents
scattered
about
in
Pontus
Galatia
Cappadocia
Asia
and
Bithynia
to
those
chosen
2
according
to
the
foreknowledge
of
God
the
Father
with
sanctification
by
the
spirit
for
the
purpose
of
being
obedient
and
sprinkled
with
the
blood
of
Jesus
Christ
May
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
be
increased
to
you
3
Praised
be
the
God
and
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
for
according
to
his
great
mercy
he
gave
us
a
new
birth
to
a
living
hope
through
the
resurrection
of
Jesus
Christ
from
the
dead
4
to
an
incorruptible
and
undefiled
and
unfading
inheritance
It
is
reserved
in
the
heavens
for
you
5
who
are
being
safeguarded
by
Gods
power
through
faith
for
a
salvation
ready
to
be
revealed
in
the
last
period
of
time
6
Because
of
this
you
are
greatly
rejoicing
though
for
a
short
time
if
it
must
be
you
have
been
distressed
by
various
trials
7
in
order
that
the
tested
quality
of
your
faith
of
much
greater
value
than
gold
that
perishes
despite
its
being
tested
by
fire
may
be
found
a
cause
for
praise
and
glory
and
honor
at
the
revelation
of
Jesus
Christ
8
Though
you
never
saw
him
you
love
him
Though
you
do
not
see
him
now
yet
you
exercise
faith
in
him
and
are
greatly
rejoicing
with
an
indescribable
and
glorious
joy
9
as
you
attain
the
goal
of
your
faith
your
salvation
10
Concerning
this
salvation
the
prophets
who
prophesied
about
the
undeserved
kindness
meant
for
you
made
a
diligent
inquiry
and
a
careful
search
11
They
kept
on
investigating
what
particular
time
or
what
season
the
spirit
within
them
was
indicating
concerning
Christ
as
it
testified
beforehand
about
the
sufferings
meant
for
Christ
and
about
the
glory
that
would
follow
12
It
was
revealed
to
them
that
they
were
ministering
not
to
themselves
but
to
you
regarding
what
has
now
been
announced
to
you
by
those
who
declared
the
good
news
to
you
with
holy
spirit
sent
from
heaven
Into
these
very
things
angels
are
desiring
to
peer
13
So
brace
up
your
minds
for
activity
keep
your
senses
completely
set
your
hope
on
the
undeserved
kindness
that
will
be
brought
to
you
at
the
revelation
of
Jesus
Christ
14
As
obedient
children
stop
being
molded
by
the
desires
you
formerly
had
in
your
ignorance
15
but
like
the
Holy
One
who
called
you
become
holy
yourselves
in
all
your
conduct
16
for
it
is
written
You
must
be
holy
because
I
am
holy
17
And
if
you
are
calling
on
the
Father
who
judges
impartially
according
to
each
ones
work
conduct
yourselves
with
fear
during
the
time
of
your
temporary
residence
18
For
you
know
that
it
was
not
with
corruptible
things
with
silver
or
gold
that
you
were
set
free
from
your
futile
way
of
life
handed
down
to
you
by
your
forefathers
19
But
it
was
with
precious
blood
like
that
of
an
unblemished
and
spotless
lamb
that
of
Christ
20
True
he
was
foreknown
before
the
founding
of
the
world
but
he
was
made
manifest
at
the
end
of
the
times
for
your
sake
21
Through
him
you
are
believers
in
God
the
one
who
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
and
gave
him
glory
so
that
your
faith
and
hope
might
be
in
God
22
Now
that
you
have
purified
yourselves
by
your
obedience
to
the
truth
with
unhypocritical
brotherly
affection
as
the
result
love
one
another
intensely
from
the
heart
23
For
you
have
been
given
a
new
birth
not
by
corruptible
but
by
incorruptible
seed
through
the
word
of
the
living
and
enduring
God
24
For
all
flesh
is
like
grass
and
all
its
glory
is
like
a
blossom
of
the
field
the
grass
withers
and
the
flower
falls
off
25
but
the
saying
of
Jehovah
endures
forever
And
this
saying
is
the
good
news
that
was
declared
to
you
1
So
rid
yourselves
of
all
badness
and
deceit
and
hypocrisy
and
envy
and
all
backbiting
2
As
newborn
infants
form
a
longing
for
the
unadulterated
milk
of
the
word
so
that
by
means
of
it
you
may
grow
to
salvation
3
provided
you
have
tasted
that
the
Lord
is
kind
4
As
you
come
to
him
a
living
stone
rejected
by
men
but
chosen
precious
to
God
5
you
yourselves
as
living
stones
are
being
built
up
into
a
spiritual
house
to
be
a
holy
priesthood
in
order
to
offer
up
spiritual
sacrifices
acceptable
to
God
through
Jesus
Christ
6
For
it
says
in
Scripture
Look
I
am
laying
in
Zion
a
chosen
stone
a
precious
foundation
cornerstone
and
no
one
exercising
faith
in
it
will
ever
be
disappointed
7
It
is
to
you
therefore
that
he
is
precious
because
you
are
believers
but
to
those
not
believing
the
stone
that
the
builders
rejected
this
has
become
the
chief
cornerstone
8
and
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
a
rock
of
offense
They
are
stumbling
because
they
are
disobedient
to
the
word
To
this
very
end
they
were
appointed
9
But
you
are
a
chosen
race
a
royal
priesthood
a
holy
nation
a
people
for
special
possession
that
you
should
declare
abroad
the
excellencies
of
the
One
who
called
you
out
of
darkness
into
his
wonderful
light
10
For
you
were
once
not
a
people
but
now
you
are
Gods
people
once
you
had
not
been
shown
mercy
but
now
you
have
received
mercy
11
Beloved
I
urge
you
as
foreigners
and
temporary
residents
to
keep
abstaining
from
fleshly
desires
which
wage
war
against
you
12
Maintain
your
conduct
fine
among
the
nations
so
that
when
they
accuse
you
of
being
wrongdoers
they
may
be
eyewitnesses
of
your
fine
works
and
as
a
result
glorify
God
in
the
day
of
his
inspection
13
For
the
Lords
sake
subject
yourselves
to
every
human
creation
whether
to
a
king
as
being
superior
14
or
to
governors
as
sent
by
him
to
punish
wrongdoers
but
to
praise
those
who
do
good
15
For
it
is
the
will
of
God
that
by
doing
good
you
may
silence
the
ignorant
talk
of
unreasonable
men
16
Be
as
free
people
using
your
freedom
not
as
a
cover
for
doing
wrong
but
as
slaves
of
God
17
Honor
men
of
all
sorts
have
love
for
the
whole
association
of
brothers
be
in
fear
of
God
honor
the
king
18
Let
servants
be
in
subjection
to
their
masters
with
all
due
fear
not
only
to
the
good
and
reasonable
but
also
to
those
hard
to
please
19
For
it
is
agreeable
when
someone
endures
hardship
and
suffers
unjustly
because
of
conscience
toward
God
20
For
what
merit
is
there
if
you
are
beaten
for
sinning
and
you
endure
it
But
if
you
endure
suffering
because
of
doing
good
this
is
an
agreeable
thing
to
God
21
In
fact
to
this
course
you
were
called
because
even
Christ
suffered
for
you
leaving
a
model
for
you
to
follow
his
steps
closely
22
He
committed
no
sin
nor
was
deception
found
in
his
mouth
23
When
he
was
being
insulted
he
did
not
insult
in
return
When
he
was
suffering
he
did
not
threaten
but
he
entrusted
himself
to
the
One
who
judges
righteously
24
He
himself
bore
our
sins
in
his
own
body
on
the
stake
so
that
we
might
die
to
sins
and
live
to
righteousness
And
by
his
wounds
you
were
healed
25
For
you
were
like
sheep
going
astray
but
now
you
have
returned
to
the
shepherd
and
overseer
of
your
souls
1
In
the
same
way
you
wives
be
in
subjection
to
your
husbands
so
that
if
any
are
not
obedient
to
the
word
they
may
be
won
without
a
word
through
the
conduct
of
their
wives
2
because
of
having
been
eyewitnesses
of
your
chaste
conduct
together
with
deep
respect
3
Do
not
let
your
adornment
be
external—the
braiding
of
hair
and
the
wearing
of
gold
ornaments
or
fine
clothing—
4
but
let
it
be
the
secret
person
of
the
heart
in
the
incorruptible
adornment
of
the
quiet
and
mild
spirit
which
is
of
great
value
in
the
eyes
of
God
5
For
this
is
how
the
holy
women
of
the
past
who
hoped
in
God
used
to
adorn
themselves
subjecting
themselves
to
their
husbands
6
just
as
Sarah
obeyed
Abraham
calling
him
lord
And
you
have
become
her
children
provided
you
continue
doing
good
and
do
not
give
in
to
fear
7
You
husbands
in
the
same
way
continue
dwelling
with
them
according
to
knowledge
Assign
them
honor
as
to
a
weaker
vessel
the
feminine
one
since
they
are
also
heirs
with
you
of
the
undeserved
favor
of
life
in
order
for
your
prayers
not
to
be
hindered
8
Finally
all
of
you
have
unity
of
mind
fellow
feeling
brotherly
affection
tender
compassion
and
humility
9
Do
not
pay
back
injury
for
injury
or
insult
for
insult
Instead
repay
with
a
blessing
for
you
were
called
to
this
course
so
that
you
might
inherit
a
blessing
10
For
whoever
would
love
life
and
see
good
days
must
guard
his
tongue
from
bad
and
his
lips
from
speaking
deception
11
Let
him
turn
away
from
what
is
bad
and
do
what
is
good
let
him
seek
peace
and
pursue
it
12
For
the
eyes
of
Jehovah
are
on
the
righteous
and
his
ears
listen
to
their
supplication
but
the
face
of
Jehovah
is
against
those
doing
bad
things
13
Indeed
who
will
harm
you
if
you
become
zealous
for
what
is
good
14
But
even
if
you
should
suffer
for
the
sake
of
righteousness
you
are
happy
However
do
not
fear
what
they
fear
nor
be
disturbed
15
But
sanctify
the
Christ
as
Lord
in
your
hearts
always
ready
to
make
a
defense
before
everyone
who
demands
of
you
a
reason
for
the
hope
you
have
but
doing
so
with
a
mild
temper
and
deep
respect
16
Maintain
a
good
conscience
so
that
in
whatever
way
you
are
spoken
against
those
who
speak
against
you
may
be
put
to
shame
because
of
your
good
conduct
as
followers
of
Christ
17
For
it
is
better
to
suffer
because
you
are
doing
good
if
it
is
Gods
will
to
allow
it
than
because
you
are
doing
evil
18
For
Christ
died
once
for
all
time
for
sins
a
righteous
person
for
unrighteous
ones
in
order
to
lead
you
to
God
He
was
put
to
death
in
the
flesh
but
made
alive
in
the
spirit
19
And
in
this
state
he
went
and
preached
to
the
spirits
in
prison
20
who
had
formerly
been
disobedient
when
God
was
patiently
waiting
in
Noahs
day
while
the
ark
was
being
constructed
in
which
a
few
people
that
is
eight
souls
were
carried
safely
through
the
water
21
Baptism
which
corresponds
to
this
is
also
now
saving
you
not
by
the
removing
of
the
filth
of
the
flesh
but
by
the
request
to
God
for
a
good
conscience
through
the
resurrection
of
Jesus
Christ
22
He
is
at
Gods
right
hand
for
he
went
to
heaven
and
angels
and
authorities
and
powers
were
made
subject
to
him
1
Since
Christ
suffered
in
the
flesh
you
too
arm
yourselves
with
the
same
mental
disposition
because
the
person
who
has
suffered
in
the
flesh
has
desisted
from
sins
2
so
that
he
may
live
the
remainder
of
his
time
in
the
flesh
no
more
for
the
desires
of
men
but
for
Gods
will
3
For
the
time
that
has
passed
by
is
sufficient
for
you
to
have
done
the
will
of
the
nations
when
you
carried
on
in
acts
of
brazen
conduct
unbridled
passions
overdrinking
wild
parties
drinking
bouts
and
lawless
idolatries
4
They
are
puzzled
that
you
do
not
continue
running
with
them
in
the
same
decadent
course
of
debauchery
so
they
speak
abusively
of
you
5
But
these
people
will
render
an
account
to
the
one
who
is
ready
to
judge
those
living
and
those
dead
6
In
fact
this
is
why
the
good
news
was
declared
also
to
the
dead
so
that
although
they
are
judged
in
the
flesh
from
the
standpoint
of
men
they
might
live
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
from
Gods
standpoint
7
But
the
end
of
all
things
has
drawn
close
Therefore
be
sound
in
mind
and
be
vigilant
with
a
view
to
prayers
8
Above
all
things
have
intense
love
for
one
another
because
love
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
9
Be
hospitable
to
one
another
without
grumbling
10
To
the
extent
that
each
one
has
received
a
gift
use
it
in
ministering
to
one
another
as
fine
stewards
of
Gods
undeserved
kindness
that
is
expressed
in
various
ways
11
If
anyone
speaks
let
him
do
so
as
speaking
pronouncements
from
God
if
anyone
ministers
let
him
do
so
as
depending
on
the
strength
that
God
supplies
so
that
in
all
things
God
may
be
glorified
through
Jesus
Christ
The
glory
and
the
might
are
his
forever
and
ever
Amen
12
Beloved
ones
do
not
be
surprised
about
the
fiery
trials
that
you
are
experiencing
as
though
something
strange
were
happening
to
you
13
On
the
contrary
go
on
rejoicing
over
the
extent
to
which
you
are
sharers
in
the
sufferings
of
the
Christ
so
that
you
may
rejoice
and
be
overjoyed
also
during
the
revelation
of
his
glory
14
If
you
are
being
reproached
for
the
name
of
Christ
you
are
happy
because
the
spirit
of
glory
yes
the
spirit
of
God
is
resting
upon
you
15
However
let
none
of
you
suffer
as
a
murderer
or
a
thief
or
a
wrongdoer
or
a
busybody
in
other
peoples
matters
16
But
if
anyone
suffers
as
a
Christian
let
him
not
feel
ashamed
but
let
him
keep
on
glorifying
God
while
bearing
this
name
17
For
it
is
the
appointed
time
for
the
judgment
to
start
with
the
house
of
God
Now
if
it
starts
first
with
us
what
will
the
outcome
be
for
those
who
are
not
obedient
to
the
good
news
of
God
18
And
if
the
righteous
man
is
being
saved
with
difficulty
what
will
happen
to
the
ungodly
man
and
the
sinner
19
So
then
let
those
who
are
suffering
in
harmony
with
the
will
of
God
keep
on
entrusting
themselves
to
a
faithful
Creator
while
they
are
doing
good
1
Therefore
as
a
fellow
elder
a
witness
of
the
sufferings
of
the
Christ
and
a
sharer
of
the
glory
that
is
to
be
revealed
I
make
this
appeal
to
the
elders
among
you
2
Shepherd
the
flock
of
God
under
your
care
serving
as
overseers
not
under
compulsion
but
willingly
before
God
not
for
love
of
dishonest
gain
but
eagerly
3
not
lording
it
over
those
who
are
Gods
inheritance
but
becoming
examples
to
the
flock
4
And
when
the
chief
shepherd
has
been
made
manifest
you
will
receive
the
unfading
crown
of
glory
5
In
the
same
way
you
younger
men
be
in
subjection
to
the
older
men
But
all
of
you
clothe
yourselves
with
humility
toward
one
another
because
God
opposes
the
haughty
ones
but
he
gives
undeserved
kindness
to
the
humble
ones
6
Humble
yourselves
therefore
under
the
mighty
hand
of
God
so
that
he
may
exalt
you
in
due
time
7
while
you
throw
all
your
anxiety
on
him
because
he
cares
for
you
8
Keep
your
senses
be
watchful
Your
adversary
the
Devil
walks
about
like
a
roaring
lion
seeking
to
devour
someone
9
But
take
your
stand
against
him
firm
in
the
faith
knowing
that
the
same
kind
of
sufferings
are
being
experienced
by
the
entire
association
of
your
brothers
in
the
world
10
But
after
you
have
suffered
a
little
while
the
God
of
all
undeserved
kindness
who
called
you
to
his
everlasting
glory
in
union
with
Christ
will
himself
finish
your
training
He
will
make
you
firm
he
will
make
you
strong
he
will
firmly
ground
you
11
To
him
be
the
might
forever
Amen
12
Through
Silvanus
whom
I
regard
as
a
faithful
brother
I
have
written
you
in
few
words
in
order
to
encourage
you
and
to
give
an
earnest
witness
that
this
is
the
true
undeserved
kindness
of
God
Stand
firm
in
it
13
She
who
is
in
Babylon
a
chosen
one
like
you
sends
you
her
greetings
and
so
does
Mark
my
son
14
Greet
one
another
with
a
kiss
of
love
May
all
of
you
who
are
in
union
with
Christ
have
peace
1
Simon
Peter
a
slave
and
an
apostle
of
Jesus
Christ
to
those
who
have
acquired
a
faith
as
precious
as
ours
through
the
righteousness
of
our
God
and
the
Savior
Jesus
Christ
2
May
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
be
increased
to
you
by
an
accurate
knowledge
of
God
and
of
Jesus
our
Lord
3
for
his
divine
power
has
granted
us
all
the
things
that
contribute
to
life
and
godly
devotion
through
the
accurate
knowledge
of
the
One
who
called
us
by
his
own
glory
and
virtue
4
Through
these
things
he
has
granted
us
the
precious
and
very
grand
promises
so
that
through
these
you
may
become
sharers
in
divine
nature
having
escaped
from
the
worlds
corruption
produced
by
wrong
desire
5
For
this
very
reason
put
forth
all
earnest
effort
to
supply
to
your
faith
virtue
to
your
virtue
knowledge
6
to
your
knowledge
self-control
to
your
self-control
endurance
to
your
endurance
godly
devotion
7
to
your
godly
devotion
brotherly
affection
to
your
brotherly
affection
love
8
For
if
these
things
exist
in
you
and
overflow
they
will
prevent
you
from
being
either
inactive
or
unfruitful
regarding
the
accurate
knowledge
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
9
For
anyone
lacking
these
things
is
blind
shutting
his
eyes
to
the
light
and
has
become
forgetful
of
his
cleansing
from
his
sins
of
long
ago
10
Therefore
brothers
be
all
the
more
diligent
to
make
your
calling
and
choosing
sure
for
yourselves
for
if
you
keep
on
doing
these
things
you
will
by
no
means
ever
fail
11
In
fact
in
this
way
you
will
be
richly
granted
entrance
into
the
everlasting
Kingdom
of
our
Lord
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
12
For
this
reason
I
intend
always
to
remind
you
of
these
things
although
you
know
them
and
are
well-established
in
the
truth
that
is
present
in
you
13
But
I
consider
it
right
as
long
as
I
am
in
this
tabernacle
to
stir
you
with
reminders
14
knowing
as
I
do
that
my
tabernacle
is
soon
to
be
removed
just
as
also
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
made
clear
to
me
15
I
will
always
do
my
utmost
so
that
after
my
departure
you
may
be
able
to
recall
these
things
for
yourselves
16
No
it
was
not
by
following
artfully
contrived
false
stories
that
we
made
known
to
you
the
power
and
presence
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
but
rather
we
were
eyewitnesses
of
his
magnificence
17
For
he
received
from
God
the
Father
honor
and
glory
when
words
such
as
these
were
conveyed
to
him
by
the
magnificent
glory
This
is
my
Son
my
beloved
whom
I
myself
have
approved
18
Yes
these
words
we
heard
coming
from
heaven
while
we
were
with
him
in
the
holy
mountain
19
So
we
have
the
prophetic
word
made
more
sure
and
you
are
doing
well
in
paying
attention
to
it
as
to
a
lamp
shining
in
a
dark
place
until
day
dawns
and
a
daystar
rises
in
your
hearts
20
For
you
know
this
first
that
no
prophecy
of
Scripture
springs
from
any
private
interpretation
21
For
prophecy
was
at
no
time
brought
by
mans
will
but
men
spoke
from
God
as
they
were
moved
by
holy
spirit
1
However
there
also
came
to
be
false
prophets
among
the
people
as
there
will
also
be
false
teachers
among
you
These
will
quietly
bring
in
destructive
sects
and
they
will
even
disown
the
owner
who
bought
them
bringing
speedy
destruction
upon
themselves
2
Furthermore
many
will
follow
their
brazen
conduct
and
because
of
them
the
way
of
the
truth
will
be
spoken
of
abusively
3
Also
they
will
greedily
exploit
you
with
counterfeit
words
But
their
judgment
decided
long
ago
is
not
moving
slowly
and
their
destruction
is
not
sleeping
4
Certainly
God
did
not
refrain
from
punishing
the
angels
who
sinned
but
threw
them
into
Tartarus
putting
them
in
chains
of
dense
darkness
to
be
reserved
for
judgment
5
And
he
did
not
refrain
from
punishing
an
ancient
world
but
kept
Noah
a
preacher
of
righteousness
safe
with
seven
others
when
he
brought
a
flood
upon
a
world
of
ungodly
people
6
And
by
reducing
the
cities
of
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
to
ashes
he
condemned
them
setting
a
pattern
for
ungodly
people
of
things
to
come
7
And
he
rescued
righteous
Lot
who
was
greatly
distressed
by
the
brazen
conduct
of
the
lawless
people—
8
for
day
after
day
that
righteous
man
was
tormenting
his
righteous
soul
over
the
lawless
deeds
that
he
saw
and
heard
while
dwelling
among
them
9
So
then
Jehovah
knows
how
to
rescue
people
of
godly
devotion
out
of
trial
but
to
reserve
unrighteous
people
to
be
destroyed
on
the
day
of
judgment
10
especially
those
who
seek
to
defile
the
flesh
of
others
and
who
despise
authority
Daring
and
self-willed
they
are
not
afraid
to
speak
abusively
of
glorious
ones
11
whereas
angels
although
they
are
greater
in
strength
and
power
do
not
bring
against
them
an
accusation
in
abusive
terms
out
of
respect
for
Jehovah
12
But
these
men
like
unreasoning
animals
that
act
on
instinct
and
are
born
to
be
caught
and
destroyed
speak
abusively
about
things
of
which
they
are
ignorant
They
will
suffer
destruction
brought
on
by
their
own
destructive
course
13
suffering
harm
as
their
reward
for
their
own
harmful
course
They
consider
it
pleasurable
to
indulge
in
luxurious
living
even
in
the
daytime
They
are
spots
and
blemishes
who
revel
in
their
deceptive
teachings
while
feasting
together
with
you
14
Their
eyes
are
full
of
adultery
and
are
unable
to
desist
from
sin
and
they
entice
unstable
ones
They
have
a
heart
trained
in
greed
They
are
accursed
children
15
Abandoning
the
straight
path
they
have
been
led
astray
They
have
followed
the
path
of
Balaam
the
son
of
Beor
who
loved
the
reward
of
wrongdoing
16
but
was
reproved
for
his
own
violation
of
what
was
right
A
voiceless
beast
of
burden
speaking
with
a
human
voice
hindered
the
prophets
mad
course
17
These
are
waterless
springs
and
mists
driven
by
a
violent
storm
and
the
blackest
darkness
has
been
reserved
for
them
18
They
make
high-sounding
statements
that
are
empty
By
appealing
to
the
desires
of
the
flesh
and
with
acts
of
brazen
conduct
they
entice
people
who
have
just
escaped
from
those
who
live
in
error
19
While
they
are
promising
them
freedom
they
themselves
are
slaves
of
corruption
for
if
anyone
is
overcome
by
someone
he
is
his
slave
20
Certainly
if
after
escaping
from
the
defilements
of
the
world
by
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
Lord
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
they
get
involved
again
with
these
very
things
and
are
overcome
their
final
state
has
become
worse
for
them
than
the
first
21
It
would
have
been
better
for
them
not
to
have
accurately
known
the
path
of
righteousness
than
after
knowing
it
to
turn
away
from
the
holy
commandment
they
had
received
22
What
the
true
proverb
says
has
happened
to
them
The
dog
has
returned
to
its
own
vomit
and
the
sow
that
was
bathed
to
rolling
in
the
mire
1
Beloved
ones
this
is
now
the
second
letter
I
am
writing
you
in
which
as
in
my
first
one
I
am
stirring
up
your
clear
thinking
faculties
by
way
of
a
reminder
2
that
you
should
remember
the
sayings
previously
spoken
by
the
holy
prophets
and
the
commandment
of
the
Lord
and
Savior
through
your
apostles
3
First
of
all
know
this
that
in
the
last
days
ridiculers
will
come
with
their
ridicule
proceeding
according
to
their
own
desires
4
and
saying
Where
is
this
promised
presence
of
his
Why
from
the
day
our
forefathers
fell
asleep
in
death
all
things
are
continuing
exactly
as
they
were
from
creations
beginning
5
For
they
deliberately
ignore
this
fact
that
long
ago
there
were
heavens
and
an
earth
standing
firmly
out
of
water
and
in
the
midst
of
water
by
the
word
of
God
6
and
that
by
those
means
the
world
of
that
time
suffered
destruction
when
it
was
flooded
with
water
7
But
by
the
same
word
the
heavens
and
the
earth
that
now
exist
are
reserved
for
fire
and
are
being
kept
until
the
day
of
judgment
and
of
destruction
of
the
ungodly
people
8
However
do
not
let
this
escape
your
notice
beloved
ones
that
one
day
is
with
Jehovah
as
a
thousand
years
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
day
9
Jehovah
is
not
slow
concerning
his
promise
as
some
people
consider
slowness
but
he
is
patient
with
you
because
he
does
not
desire
anyone
to
be
destroyed
but
desires
all
to
attain
to
repentance
10
But
Jehovahs
day
will
come
as
a
thief
in
which
the
heavens
will
pass
away
with
a
roar
but
the
elements
being
intensely
hot
will
be
dissolved
and
earth
and
the
works
in
it
will
be
exposed
11
Since
all
these
things
are
to
be
dissolved
in
this
way
consider
what
sort
of
people
you
ought
to
be
in
holy
acts
of
conduct
and
deeds
of
godly
devotion
12
as
you
await
and
keep
close
in
mind
the
presence
of
the
day
of
Jehovah
through
which
the
heavens
will
be
destroyed
in
flames
and
the
elements
will
melt
in
the
intense
heat
13
But
there
are
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
that
we
are
awaiting
according
to
his
promise
and
in
these
righteousness
is
to
dwell
14
Therefore
beloved
ones
since
you
are
awaiting
these
things
do
your
utmost
to
be
found
finally
by
him
spotless
and
unblemished
and
in
peace
15
Furthermore
consider
the
patience
of
our
Lord
as
salvation
just
as
our
beloved
brother
Paul
also
wrote
you
according
to
the
wisdom
given
him
16
speaking
about
these
things
as
he
does
in
all
his
letters
However
some
things
in
them
are
hard
to
understand
and
these
things
the
ignorant
and
unstable
are
twisting
as
they
do
also
the
rest
of
the
Scriptures
to
their
own
destruction
17
You
therefore
beloved
ones
having
this
advance
knowledge
be
on
your
guard
so
that
you
may
not
be
led
astray
with
them
by
the
error
of
the
lawless
people
and
fall
from
your
own
steadfastness
18
No
but
go
on
growing
in
the
undeserved
kindness
and
knowledge
of
our
Lord
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
To
him
be
the
glory
both
now
and
to
the
day
of
eternity
Amen
1
That
which
was
from
the
beginning
which
we
have
heard
which
we
have
seen
with
our
eyes
which
we
have
observed
and
our
hands
have
felt
concerning
the
word
of
life
2
yes
the
life
was
made
manifest
and
we
have
seen
and
are
bearing
witness
and
reporting
to
you
the
everlasting
life
that
was
with
the
Father
and
was
made
manifest
to
us
3
that
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
we
are
reporting
also
to
you
so
that
you
too
may
have
fellowship
with
us
And
this
fellowship
of
ours
is
with
the
Father
and
with
his
Son
Jesus
Christ
4
And
we
are
writing
these
things
so
that
our
joy
may
be
complete
5
This
is
the
message
that
we
heard
from
him
and
are
announcing
to
you
God
is
light
and
there
is
no
darkness
at
all
in
him
6
If
we
make
the
statement
We
are
having
fellowship
with
him

and
yet
we
go
on
walking
in
the
darkness
we
are
lying
and
are
not
practicing
the
truth
7
However
if
we
are
walking
in
the
light
as
he
himself
is
in
the
light
we
do
have
fellowship
with
one
another
and
the
blood
of
Jesus
his
Son
cleanses
us
from
all
sin
8
If
we
make
the
statement
We
have
no
sin

we
are
misleading
ourselves
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
9
If
we
confess
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
righteous
so
as
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
10
If
we
make
the
statement
We
have
not
sinned

we
are
making
him
a
liar
and
his
word
is
not
in
us
1
My
little
children
I
am
writing
you
these
things
so
that
you
may
not
commit
a
sin
And
yet
if
anyone
does
commit
a
sin
we
have
a
helper
with
the
Father
Jesus
Christ
a
righteous
one
2
And
he
is
a
propitiatory
sacrifice
for
our
sins
yet
not
for
ours
only
but
also
for
the
whole
worlds
3
And
by
this
we
realize
that
we
have
come
to
know
him
namely
if
we
continue
observing
his
commandments
4
The
one
who
says
I
have
come
to
know
him

and
yet
does
not
observe
his
commandments
is
a
liar
and
the
truth
is
not
in
this
person
5
But
whoever
does
observe
his
word
in
this
person
the
love
of
God
has
truly
been
made
perfect
By
this
we
know
that
we
are
in
union
with
him
6
The
one
who
says
he
remains
in
union
with
him
is
himself
under
obligation
to
go
on
walking
just
as
that
one
walked
7
Beloved
ones
I
am
writing
you
not
a
new
commandment
but
an
old
commandment
that
you
have
had
from
the
beginning
This
old
commandment
is
the
word
that
you
heard
8
Again
I
am
writing
you
a
new
commandment
which
is
true
in
his
case
and
in
yours
because
the
darkness
is
passing
away
and
the
true
light
is
already
shining
9
The
one
who
says
that
he
is
in
the
light
and
yet
hates
his
brother
is
still
in
the
darkness
10
The
one
who
loves
his
brother
remains
in
the
light
and
in
him
there
is
no
cause
for
stumbling
11
But
the
one
who
hates
his
brother
is
in
the
darkness
and
is
walking
in
the
darkness
and
he
does
not
know
where
he
is
going
because
the
darkness
has
blinded
his
eyes
12
I
am
writing
you
little
children
because
your
sins
have
been
forgiven
you
for
the
sake
of
his
name
13
I
am
writing
you
fathers
because
you
have
come
to
know
him
who
is
from
the
beginning
I
am
writing
you
young
men
because
you
have
conquered
the
wicked
one
I
write
you
young
children
because
you
have
come
to
know
the
Father
14
I
write
you
fathers
because
you
have
come
to
know
him
who
is
from
the
beginning
I
write
you
young
men
because
you
are
strong
and
the
word
of
God
remains
in
you
and
you
have
conquered
the
wicked
one
15
Do
not
love
either
the
world
or
the
things
in
the
world
If
anyone
loves
the
world
the
love
of
the
Father
is
not
in
him
16
because
everything
in
the
world—the
desire
of
the
flesh
and
the
desire
of
the
eyes
and
the
showy
display
of
ones
means
of
life—does
not
originate
with
the
Father
but
originates
with
the
world
17
Furthermore
the
world
is
passing
away
and
so
is
its
desire
but
the
one
who
does
the
will
of
God
remains
forever
18
Young
children
it
is
the
last
hour
and
just
as
you
have
heard
that
the
antichrist
is
coming
even
now
many
antichrists
have
appeared
from
which
fact
we
know
that
it
is
the
last
hour
19
They
went
out
from
us
but
they
were
not
of
our
sort
for
if
they
had
been
of
our
sort
they
would
have
remained
with
us
But
they
went
out
so
that
it
might
be
shown
that
not
all
are
of
our
sort
20
And
you
have
an
anointing
from
the
holy
one
and
all
of
you
have
knowledge
21
I
write
you
not
because
you
do
not
know
the
truth
but
because
you
know
it
and
because
no
lie
originates
with
the
truth
22
Who
is
the
liar
but
the
one
who
denies
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
This
is
the
antichrist
the
one
who
denies
the
Father
and
the
Son
23
Everyone
who
denies
the
Son
does
not
have
the
Father
either
But
whoever
acknowledges
the
Son
has
the
Father
also
24
As
for
you
what
you
have
heard
from
the
beginning
must
remain
in
you
If
what
you
have
heard
from
the
beginning
remains
in
you
you
will
also
remain
in
union
with
the
Son
and
in
union
with
the
Father
25
Furthermore
this
is
what
he
himself
promised
us—the
life
everlasting
26
I
write
you
these
things
about
those
who
are
trying
to
mislead
you
27
And
as
for
you
the
anointing
that
you
received
from
him
remains
in
you
and
you
do
not
need
anyone
to
be
teaching
you
but
the
anointing
from
him
is
teaching
you
about
all
things
and
is
true
and
is
no
lie
Just
as
it
has
taught
you
remain
in
union
with
him
28
So
now
little
children
remain
in
union
with
him
so
that
when
he
is
made
manifest
we
may
have
freeness
of
speech
and
not
shrink
away
from
him
in
shame
at
his
presence
29
If
you
know
that
he
is
righteous
you
also
know
that
everyone
who
practices
righteousness
has
been
born
from
him
1
See
what
sort
of
love
the
Father
has
given
us
that
we
should
be
called
children
of
God
And
that
is
what
we
are
That
is
why
the
world
does
not
know
us
because
it
has
not
come
to
know
him
2
Beloved
ones
we
are
now
children
of
God
but
it
has
not
yet
been
made
manifest
what
we
will
be
We
do
know
that
when
he
is
made
manifest
we
will
be
like
him
because
we
will
see
him
just
as
he
is
3
And
everyone
who
has
this
hope
in
him
purifies
himself
just
as
that
one
is
pure
4
Everyone
who
practices
sin
is
also
practicing
lawlessness
and
sin
is
lawlessness
5
You
know
too
that
he
was
made
manifest
to
take
away
our
sins
and
there
is
no
sin
in
him
6
Everyone
remaining
in
union
with
him
does
not
practice
sin
no
one
who
practices
sin
has
either
seen
him
or
come
to
know
him
7
Little
children
let
no
one
mislead
you
the
one
who
practices
righteousness
is
righteous
just
as
that
one
is
righteous
8
The
one
who
practices
sin
originates
with
the
Devil
because
the
Devil
has
been
sinning
from
the
beginning
For
this
purpose
the
Son
of
God
was
made
manifest
to
break
up
the
works
of
the
Devil
9
Everyone
who
has
been
born
from
God
does
not
practice
sin
for
His
seed
remains
in
such
one
and
he
cannot
practice
sin
for
he
has
been
born
from
God
10
The
children
of
God
and
the
children
of
the
Devil
are
evident
by
this
fact
Whoever
does
not
practice
righteousness
does
not
originate
with
God
nor
does
the
one
who
does
not
love
his
brother
11
For
this
is
the
message
that
you
have
heard
from
the
beginning
that
we
should
love
one
another
12
not
like
Cain
who
originated
with
the
wicked
one
and
slaughtered
his
brother
And
for
what
reason
did
he
slaughter
him
Because
his
own
works
were
wicked
but
those
of
his
brother
were
righteous
13
Do
not
be
surprised
brothers
that
the
world
hates
you
14
We
know
that
we
have
passed
over
from
death
to
life
because
we
love
the
brothers
The
one
who
does
not
love
remains
in
death
15
Everyone
who
hates
his
brother
is
a
murderer
and
you
know
that
no
murderer
has
everlasting
life
remaining
in
him
16
By
this
we
have
come
to
know
love
because
that
one
surrendered
his
life
for
us
and
we
are
under
obligation
to
surrender
our
lives
for
our
brothers
17
But
whoever
has
the
material
possessions
of
this
world
and
sees
his
brother
in
need
and
yet
refuses
to
show
him
compassion
in
what
way
does
the
love
of
God
remain
in
him
18
Little
children
we
should
love
not
in
word
or
with
the
tongue
but
in
deed
and
truth
19
By
this
we
will
know
that
we
originate
with
the
truth
and
we
will
assure
our
hearts
before
him
20
regarding
whatever
our
hearts
may
condemn
us
in
because
God
is
greater
than
our
hearts
and
knows
all
things
21
Beloved
ones
if
our
hearts
do
not
condemn
us
we
have
freeness
of
speech
toward
God
22
and
whatever
we
ask
we
receive
from
him
because
we
are
observing
his
commandments
and
doing
what
is
pleasing
in
his
eyes
23
Indeed
this
is
his
commandment
that
we
have
faith
in
the
name
of
his
Son
Jesus
Christ
and
love
one
another
just
as
he
gave
us
a
commandment
24
Moreover
the
one
who
observes
his
commandments
remains
in
union
with
him
and
he
in
union
with
such
one
And
by
the
spirit
that
he
gave
us
we
know
that
he
remains
in
union
with
us
1
Beloved
ones
do
not
believe
every
inspired
statement
but
test
the
inspired
statements
to
see
whether
they
originate
with
God
for
many
false
prophets
have
gone
out
into
the
world
2
This
is
how
you
know
that
the
inspired
statement
is
from
God
Every
inspired
statement
that
acknowledges
Jesus
Christ
as
having
come
in
the
flesh
originates
with
God
3
But
every
inspired
statement
that
does
not
acknowledge
Jesus
does
not
originate
with
God
Furthermore
this
is
the
antichrists
inspired
statement
that
you
have
heard
was
coming
and
now
it
is
already
in
the
world
4
You
originate
with
God
little
children
and
you
have
conquered
them
because
the
one
who
is
in
union
with
you
is
greater
than
the
one
who
is
in
union
with
the
world
5
They
originate
with
the
world
that
is
why
they
speak
what
originates
with
the
world
and
the
world
listens
to
them
6
We
originate
with
God
Whoever
comes
to
know
God
listens
to
us
whoever
does
not
originate
with
God
does
not
listen
to
us
By
this
we
distinguish
the
inspired
statement
of
truth
from
the
inspired
statement
of
error
7
Beloved
ones
let
us
continue
loving
one
another
because
love
is
from
God
and
everyone
who
loves
has
been
born
from
God
and
knows
God
8
Whoever
does
not
love
has
not
come
to
know
God
because
God
is
love
9
By
this
the
love
of
God
was
revealed
in
our
case
that
God
sent
his
only-begotten
Son
into
the
world
so
that
we
might
gain
life
through
him
10
The
love
is
in
this
respect
not
that
we
have
loved
God
but
that
he
loved
us
and
sent
his
Son
as
a
propitiatory
sacrifice
for
our
sins
11
Beloved
ones
if
this
is
how
God
loved
us
then
we
are
also
under
obligation
to
love
one
another
12
No
one
has
seen
God
at
any
time
If
we
continue
loving
one
another
God
remains
in
us
and
his
love
is
made
perfect
in
us
13
By
this
we
know
that
we
are
remaining
in
union
with
him
and
he
in
union
with
us
because
he
has
given
his
spirit
to
us
14
In
addition
we
ourselves
have
seen
and
are
bearing
witness
that
the
Father
has
sent
his
Son
as
Savior
of
the
world
15
Whoever
acknowledges
that
Jesus
is
Gods
Son
God
remains
in
union
with
such
one
and
he
in
union
with
God
16
And
we
have
come
to
know
and
believe
the
love
that
God
has
for
us
God
is
love
and
the
one
who
remains
in
love
remains
in
union
with
God
and
God
remains
in
union
with
him
17
In
this
way
love
has
been
made
perfect
in
us
so
that
we
may
have
freeness
of
speech
in
the
day
of
judgment
because
just
as
that
one
is
so
are
we
ourselves
in
this
world
18
There
is
no
fear
in
love
but
perfect
love
casts
fear
out
because
fear
restrains
us
Indeed
the
one
who
is
fearful
has
not
been
made
perfect
in
love
19
We
love
because
he
first
loved
us
20
If
anyone
says
I
love
God

and
yet
is
hating
his
brother
he
is
a
liar
For
the
one
who
does
not
love
his
brother
whom
he
has
seen
cannot
love
God
whom
he
has
not
seen
21
And
we
have
this
commandment
from
him
that
whoever
loves
God
must
also
love
his
brother
1
Everyone
who
believes
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
has
been
born
from
God
and
everyone
who
loves
the
one
who
caused
to
be
born
loves
him
who
has
been
born
from
that
one
2
By
this
we
know
that
we
love
the
children
of
God
when
we
love
God
and
carry
out
his
commandments
3
For
this
is
what
the
love
of
God
means
that
we
observe
his
commandments
and
yet
his
commandments
are
not
burdensome
4
because
everyone
who
has
been
born
from
God
conquers
the
world
And
this
is
the
conquest
that
has
conquered
the
world
our
faith
5
Who
can
conquer
the
world
Is
it
not
the
one
who
has
faith
that
Jesus
is
the
Son
of
God
6
This
is
the
one
who
came
by
means
of
water
and
blood
Jesus
Christ
not
with
the
water
only
but
with
the
water
and
with
the
blood
And
the
spirit
is
bearing
witness
because
the
spirit
is
the
truth
7
For
there
are
three
witness
bearers
8
the
spirit
and
the
water
and
the
blood
and
the
three
are
in
agreement
9
If
we
accept
the
witness
of
men
the
witness
of
God
is
greater
Because
this
is
the
witness
God
gives
the
witness
that
he
has
given
about
his
Son
10
The
person
putting
his
faith
in
the
Son
of
God
has
the
witness
within
himself
The
person
not
having
faith
in
God
has
made
him
a
liar
because
he
has
not
put
his
faith
in
the
witness
given
by
God
concerning
his
Son
11
And
this
is
the
witness
that
God
gave
us
everlasting
life
and
this
life
is
in
his
Son
12
The
one
who
has
the
Son
has
this
life
the
one
who
does
not
have
the
Son
of
God
does
not
have
this
life
13
I
write
you
these
things
so
that
you
may
know
that
you
have
life
everlasting
you
who
put
your
faith
in
the
name
of
the
Son
of
God
14
And
this
is
the
confidence
that
we
have
toward
him
that
no
matter
what
we
ask
according
to
his
will
he
hears
us
15
And
if
we
know
that
he
hears
us
concerning
whatever
we
are
asking
we
know
that
we
are
to
have
the
things
we
ask
for
since
we
have
asked
them
of
him
16
If
anyone
catches
sight
of
his
brother
committing
a
sin
that
does
not
incur
death
he
will
ask
and
God
will
give
life
to
him
yes
to
those
not
committing
sin
that
incurs
death
There
is
a
sin
that
does
incur
death
It
is
concerning
that
sin
that
I
do
not
tell
him
to
make
request
17
All
unrighteousness
is
sin
and
yet
there
is
a
sin
that
does
not
incur
death
18
We
know
that
everyone
who
has
been
born
from
God
does
not
practice
sin
but
the
one
born
from
God
watches
him
and
the
wicked
one
cannot
take
hold
of
him
19
We
know
that
we
originate
with
God
but
the
whole
world
is
lying
in
the
power
of
the
wicked
one
20
But
we
know
that
the
Son
of
God
has
come
and
he
has
given
us
insight
so
that
we
may
gain
the
knowledge
of
the
one
who
is
true
And
we
are
in
union
with
the
one
who
is
true
by
means
of
his
Son
Jesus
Christ
This
is
the
true
God
and
life
everlasting
21
Little
children
guard
yourselves
from
idols
1
The
older
man
to
the
chosen
lady
and
to
her
children
whom
I
truly
love
and
not
only
I
but
also
all
those
who
have
come
to
know
the
truth
2
because
of
the
truth
that
remains
in
us
and
will
be
with
us
forever
3
There
will
be
with
us
undeserved
kindness
mercy
and
peace
from
God
the
Father
and
from
Jesus
Christ
the
Son
of
the
Father
with
truth
and
love
4
I
rejoice
very
much
because
I
have
found
some
of
your
children
walking
in
the
truth
just
as
we
received
commandment
from
the
Father
5
So
now
I
request
you
lady
that
we
love
one
another
I
am
writing
you
not
a
new
commandment
but
one
that
we
had
from
the
beginning
6
And
this
is
what
love
means
that
we
go
on
walking
according
to
his
commandments
This
is
the
commandment
just
as
you
have
heard
from
the
beginning
that
you
should
go
on
walking
in
it
7
For
many
deceivers
have
gone
out
into
the
world
those
not
acknowledging
Jesus
Christ
as
coming
in
the
flesh
This
is
the
deceiver
and
the
antichrist
8
Look
out
for
yourselves
so
that
you
do
not
lose
the
things
we
have
worked
to
produce
but
that
you
may
obtain
a
full
reward
9
Everyone
who
pushes
ahead
and
does
not
remain
in
the
teaching
of
the
Christ
does
not
have
God
The
one
who
does
remain
in
this
teaching
is
the
one
who
has
both
the
Father
and
the
Son
10
If
anyone
comes
to
you
and
does
not
bring
this
teaching
do
not
receive
him
into
your
homes
or
say
a
greeting
to
him
11
For
the
one
who
says
a
greeting
to
him
is
a
sharer
in
his
wicked
works
12
Although
I
have
many
things
to
write
to
you
I
do
not
want
to
do
so
with
paper
and
ink
but
I
am
hoping
to
come
to
you
and
to
speak
with
you
face-to-face
so
that
your
joy
may
be
in
full
measure
13
The
children
of
your
sister
the
chosen
one
send
you
their
greetings
1
The
older
man
to
Gaius
the
beloved
whom
I
truly
love
2
Beloved
one
I
pray
that
in
all
things
you
continue
to
prosper
and
enjoy
good
health
just
as
you
are
now
prospering
3
For
I
rejoiced
very
much
when
brothers
came
and
bore
witness
about
the
truth
you
hold
as
you
go
on
walking
in
the
truth
4
No
greater
joy
do
I
have
than
this
that
I
should
hear
that
my
children
go
on
walking
in
the
truth
5
Beloved
one
you
show
your
faithfulness
in
what
you
do
for
the
brothers
even
though
they
are
strangers
to
you
6
They
have
given
a
witness
about
your
love
before
the
congregation
Please
send
them
on
their
way
in
a
manner
worthy
of
God
7
For
it
was
in
behalf
of
his
name
that
they
went
out
not
taking
anything
from
the
people
of
the
nations
8
So
we
are
under
obligation
to
show
hospitality
to
such
ones
so
that
we
may
become
fellow
workers
in
the
truth
9
I
wrote
something
to
the
congregation
but
Diotrephes
who
likes
to
have
the
first
place
among
them
does
not
accept
anything
from
us
with
respect
10
That
is
why
if
I
come
I
will
call
attention
to
the
works
he
is
doing
in
spreading
malicious
talk
about
us
Not
being
content
with
this
he
refuses
to
welcome
the
brothers
with
respect
and
those
who
want
to
welcome
them
he
tries
to
hinder
and
to
throw
out
of
the
congregation
11
Beloved
one
do
not
imitate
what
is
bad
but
imitate
what
is
good
The
one
who
does
good
originates
with
God
The
one
who
does
bad
has
not
seen
God
12
Demetrius
has
been
well-reported-on
by
them
all
and
by
the
truth
itself
In
fact
we
too
are
bearing
witness
about
him
and
you
know
that
the
witness
we
give
is
true
13
I
had
many
things
to
write
you
but
I
do
not
wish
to
go
on
writing
you
with
pen
and
ink
14
However
I
am
hoping
to
see
you
soon
and
we
will
speak
face-to-face
May
you
have
peace
The
friends
send
you
their
greetings
Give
my
greetings
to
the
friends
by
name
1
Jude
a
slave
of
Jesus
Christ
but
a
brother
of
James
to
the
called
ones
who
are
loved
by
God
the
Father
and
preserved
for
Jesus
Christ
2
May
mercy
and
peace
and
love
be
increased
to
you
3
Beloved
ones
although
I
was
making
every
effort
to
write
you
about
the
salvation
we
hold
in
common
I
found
it
necessary
to
write
you
to
urge
you
to
put
up
a
hard
fight
for
the
faith
that
was
once
for
all
time
delivered
to
the
holy
ones
4
My
reason
is
that
certain
men
have
slipped
in
among
you
who
were
long
ago
appointed
to
this
judgment
by
the
Scriptures
they
are
ungodly
men
who
turn
the
undeserved
kindness
of
our
God
into
an
excuse
for
brazen
conduct
and
who
prove
false
to
our
only
owner
and
Lord
Jesus
Christ
5
Although
you
are
fully
aware
of
all
of
this
I
want
to
remind
you
that
Jehovah
having
saved
a
people
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
afterward
destroyed
those
not
showing
faith
6
And
the
angels
who
did
not
keep
their
original
position
but
forsook
their
own
proper
dwelling
place
he
has
reserved
with
eternal
bonds
in
dense
darkness
for
the
judgment
of
the
great
day
7
In
the
same
manner
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
and
the
cities
around
them
also
gave
themselves
over
to
gross
sexual
immorality
and
pursued
unnatural
fleshly
desires
they
are
placed
before
us
as
a
warning
example
by
undergoing
the
judicial
punishment
of
everlasting
fire
8
Despite
this
these
men
too
are
indulging
in
dreams
defiling
the
flesh
despising
authority
and
speaking
abusively
of
glorious
ones
9
But
when
Michael
the
archangel
had
a
difference
with
the
Devil
and
was
disputing
about
Moses
body
he
did
not
dare
to
bring
a
judgment
against
him
in
abusive
terms
but
said
May
Jehovah
rebuke
you
10
But
these
men
are
speaking
abusively
about
all
the
things
they
really
do
not
understand
And
in
all
the
things
that
they
do
understand
by
instinct
like
unreasoning
animals
they
go
on
corrupting
themselves
11
Too
bad
for
them
for
they
have
followed
the
path
of
Cain
and
have
rushed
into
the
erroneous
course
of
Balaam
for
reward
and
they
have
perished
in
the
rebellious
talk
of
Korah
12
These
are
the
rocks
hidden
below
water
at
your
love
feasts
while
they
feast
with
you
shepherds
who
feed
themselves
without
fear
waterless
clouds
carried
here
and
there
by
the
wind
fruitless
trees
in
late
autumn
having
died
twice
and
having
been
uprooted
13
wild
waves
of
the
sea
that
cast
up
the
foam
of
their
own
shame
stars
with
no
set
course
for
which
the
blackest
darkness
stands
reserved
forever
14
Yes
the
seventh
one
in
line
from
Adam
Enoch
also
prophesied
about
them
when
he
said
Look
Jehovah
came
with
his
holy
myriads
15
to
execute
judgment
against
all
and
to
convict
all
the
ungodly
concerning
all
their
ungodly
deeds
that
they
did
in
an
ungodly
way
and
concerning
all
the
shocking
things
that
ungodly
sinners
spoke
against
him
16
These
men
are
murmurers
complainers
about
their
lot
in
life
following
their
own
desires
and
their
mouths
make
grandiose
boasts
while
they
are
flattering
others
for
their
own
benefit
17
As
for
you
beloved
ones
call
to
mind
the
sayings
that
have
been
previously
spoken
by
the
apostles
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
18
how
they
used
to
say
to
you
In
the
last
time
there
will
be
ridiculers
following
their
own
desires
for
ungodly
things
19
These
are
the
ones
who
cause
divisions
animalistic
men
not
having
spirituality
20
But
you
beloved
ones
build
yourselves
up
on
your
most
holy
faith
and
pray
with
holy
spirit
21
in
order
to
keep
yourselves
in
Gods
love
while
you
await
the
mercy
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
with
everlasting
life
in
view
22
Also
continue
showing
mercy
to
some
who
have
doubts
23
save
them
by
snatching
them
out
of
the
fire
But
continue
showing
mercy
to
others
doing
so
with
fear
while
you
hate
even
the
garment
that
has
been
stained
by
the
flesh
24
Now
to
the
one
who
is
able
to
guard
you
from
stumbling
and
to
make
you
stand
unblemished
in
the
sight
of
his
glory
with
great
joy
25
to
the
only
God
our
Savior
through
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
be
glory
majesty
might
and
authority
for
all
past
eternity
and
now
and
into
all
eternity
Amen
1
A
revelation
by
Jesus
Christ
which
God
gave
him
to
show
his
slaves
the
things
that
must
shortly
take
place
And
he
sent
his
angel
and
presented
it
in
signs
through
him
to
his
slave
John
2
who
bore
witness
to
the
word
God
gave
and
to
the
witness
Jesus
Christ
gave
yes
to
all
the
things
he
saw
3
Happy
is
the
one
who
reads
aloud
and
those
who
hear
the
words
of
this
prophecy
and
who
observe
the
things
written
in
it
for
the
appointed
time
is
near
4
John
to
the
seven
congregations
that
are
in
the
province
of
Asia
May
you
have
undeserved
kindness
and
peace
from
the
One
who
is
and
who
was
and
who
is
coming

and
from
the
seven
spirits
that
are
before
his
throne
5
and
from
Jesus
Christ
the
Faithful
Witness

the
firstborn
from
the
dead

and
the
Ruler
of
the
kings
of
the
earth
To
him
who
loves
us
and
who
set
us
free
from
our
sins
by
means
of
his
own
blood—
6
and
he
made
us
to
be
a
kingdom
priests
to
his
God
and
Father—yes
to
him
be
the
glory
and
the
might
forever
Amen
7
Look
He
is
coming
with
the
clouds
and
every
eye
will
see
him
and
those
who
pierced
him
and
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
will
beat
themselves
in
grief
because
of
him
Yes
Amen
8
I
am
the
Alpha
and
the
Omega

says
Jehovah
God
the
One
who
is
and
who
was
and
who
is
coming
the
Almighty
9
I
John
your
brother
and
a
sharer
with
you
in
the
tribulation
and
kingdom
and
endurance
in
association
with
Jesus
was
on
the
island
called
Patmos
for
speaking
about
God
and
bearing
witness
concerning
Jesus
10
By
inspiration
I
came
to
be
in
the
Lords
day
and
I
heard
behind
me
a
strong
voice
like
that
of
a
trumpet
11
saying
What
you
see
write
in
a
scroll
and
send
it
to
the
seven
congregations
in
Ephesus
in
Smyrna
in
Pergamum
in
Thyatira
in
Sardis
in
Philadelphia
and
in
Laodicea
12
I
turned
to
see
who
was
speaking
with
me
and
when
I
turned
I
saw
seven
golden
lampstands
13
and
in
the
midst
of
the
lampstands
someone
like
a
son
of
man
clothed
in
a
garment
that
reached
down
to
the
feet
and
wearing
a
golden
sash
around
his
chest
14
Moreover
his
head
and
his
hair
were
white
as
white
wool
as
snow
and
his
eyes
were
like
a
fiery
flame
15
and
his
feet
were
like
fine
copper
when
glowing
in
a
furnace
and
his
voice
was
like
the
sound
of
many
waters
16
And
he
had
in
his
right
hand
seven
stars
and
out
of
his
mouth
a
sharp
long
two-edged
sword
was
protruding
and
his
countenance
was
like
the
sun
when
it
shines
at
its
brightest
17
When
I
saw
him
I
fell
as
dead
at
his
feet
And
he
laid
his
right
hand
on
me
and
said
Do
not
be
afraid
I
am
the
First
and
the
Last
18
and
the
living
one
and
I
became
dead
but
look
I
am
living
forever
and
ever
and
I
have
the
keys
of
death
and
of
the
Grave
19
So
write
down
the
things
you
saw
and
the
things
that
are
and
the
things
that
will
take
place
after
these
20
As
for
the
sacred
secret
of
the
seven
stars
that
you
saw
in
my
right
hand
and
of
the
seven
golden
lampstands
The
seven
stars
mean
the
angels
of
the
seven
congregations
and
the
seven
lampstands
mean
the
seven
congregations
1
To
the
angel
of
the
congregation
in
Ephesus
write
These
are
the
things
that
he
says
who
holds
the
seven
stars
in
his
right
hand
and
walks
among
the
seven
golden
lampstands
2
I
know
your
deeds
and
your
labor
and
endurance
and
that
you
cannot
tolerate
bad
men
and
that
you
put
to
the
test
those
who
say
they
are
apostles
but
they
are
not
and
you
found
them
to
be
liars
3
You
are
also
showing
endurance
and
you
have
persevered
for
the
sake
of
my
name
and
have
not
grown
weary
4
Nevertheless
I
hold
this
against
you
that
you
have
left
the
love
you
had
at
first
5
Therefore
remember
from
where
you
have
fallen
and
repent
and
do
the
deeds
you
did
at
first
If
you
do
not
I
will
come
to
you
and
I
will
remove
your
lampstand
from
its
place
unless
you
repent
6
Still
you
do
have
this
in
your
favor
that
you
hate
the
deeds
of
the
sect
of
Nicolaus
which
I
also
hate
7
Let
the
one
who
has
an
ear
hear
what
the
spirit
says
to
the
congregations
To
the
one
who
conquers
I
will
grant
to
eat
of
the
tree
of
life
which
is
in
the
paradise
of
God
8
And
to
the
angel
of
the
congregation
in
Smyrna
write
These
are
the
things
that
he
says
the
First
and
the
Last

who
became
dead
and
came
to
life
again
9
I
know
your
tribulation
and
poverty—but
you
are
rich—and
the
blasphemy
by
those
who
call
themselves
Jews
and
really
are
not
but
they
are
a
synagogue
of
Satan
10
Do
not
be
afraid
of
the
things
you
are
about
to
suffer
Look
The
Devil
will
keep
on
throwing
some
of
you
into
prison
so
that
you
may
be
fully
put
to
the
test
and
you
will
have
tribulation
for
ten
days
Prove
yourself
faithful
even
to
death
and
I
will
give
you
the
crown
of
life
11
Let
the
one
who
has
an
ear
hear
what
the
spirit
says
to
the
congregations
The
one
who
conquers
will
by
no
means
be
harmed
by
the
second
death
12
To
the
angel
of
the
congregation
in
Pergamum
write
These
are
the
things
that
he
says
who
has
the
sharp
long
two-edged
sword
13
I
know
where
you
are
dwelling
that
is
where
the
throne
of
Satan
is
and
yet
you
keep
holding
fast
to
my
name
and
you
did
not
deny
your
faith
in
me
even
in
the
days
of
Antipas
my
faithful
witness
who
was
killed
by
your
side
where
Satan
is
dwelling
14
Nevertheless
I
have
a
few
things
against
you
that
you
have
there
those
adhering
to
the
teaching
of
Balaam
who
taught
Balak
to
put
a
stumbling
block
before
the
sons
of
Israel
to
eat
things
sacrificed
to
idols
and
to
commit
sexual
immorality
15
In
the
same
way
you
also
have
those
adhering
to
the
teaching
of
the
sect
of
Nicolaus
16
So
repent
If
you
do
not
I
am
coming
to
you
quickly
and
I
will
war
against
them
with
the
long
sword
of
my
mouth
17
Let
the
one
who
has
an
ear
hear
what
the
spirit
says
to
the
congregations
To
the
one
who
conquers
I
will
give
some
of
the
hidden
manna
and
I
will
give
him
a
white
pebble
and
written
on
the
pebble
is
a
new
name
that
no
one
knows
except
the
one
receiving
it
18
To
the
angel
of
the
congregation
in
Thyatira
write
These
are
the
things
that
the
Son
of
God
says
the
one
who
has
eyes
like
a
fiery
flame
and
whose
feet
are
like
fine
copper
19
I
know
your
deeds
and
your
love
and
faith
and
ministry
and
endurance
and
that
your
deeds
of
late
are
more
than
those
you
did
at
first
20
Nevertheless
I
do
hold
this
against
you
that
you
tolerate
that
woman
Jezebel
who
calls
herself
a
prophetess
and
she
teaches
and
misleads
my
slaves
to
commit
sexual
immorality
and
to
eat
things
sacrificed
to
idols
21
And
I
gave
her
time
to
repent
but
she
is
not
willing
to
repent
of
her
sexual
immorality
22
Look
I
am
about
to
throw
her
into
a
sickbed
and
those
committing
adultery
with
her
into
great
tribulation
unless
they
repent
of
her
deeds
23
And
I
will
kill
her
children
with
deadly
plague
so
that
all
the
congregations
will
know
that
I
am
the
one
who
searches
the
innermost
thoughts
and
hearts
and
I
will
give
to
you
individually
according
to
your
deeds
24
However
I
say
to
the
rest
of
you
who
are
in
Thyatira
all
those
who
do
not
follow
this
teaching
those
who
did
not
get
to
know
the
so-called
deep
things
of
Satan
I
am
not
putting
on
you
any
other
burden
25
Just
the
same
hold
fast
to
what
you
have
until
I
come
26
And
to
the
one
who
conquers
and
observes
my
deeds
down
to
the
end
I
will
give
authority
over
the
nations
27
and
he
will
shepherd
the
people
with
an
iron
rod
so
that
they
will
be
broken
to
pieces
like
clay
vessels
just
as
I
have
received
from
my
Father
28
And
I
will
give
him
the
morning
star
29
Let
the
one
who
has
an
ear
hear
what
the
spirit
says
to
the
congregations
1
To
the
angel
of
the
congregation
in
Sardis
write
These
are
the
things
that
he
says
who
has
the
seven
spirits
of
God
and
the
seven
stars
I
know
your
deeds
that
you
have
the
name
that
you
are
alive
but
you
are
dead
2
Become
watchful
and
strengthen
the
things
remaining
that
were
ready
to
die
for
I
have
not
found
your
works
fully
performed
before
my
God
3
Therefore
continue
mindful
of
how
you
have
received
and
how
you
heard
and
go
on
keeping
it
and
repent
Certainly
unless
you
wake
up
I
will
come
as
a
thief
and
you
will
not
know
at
all
at
what
hour
I
will
come
upon
you
4
Nevertheless
you
do
have
a
few
individuals
in
Sardis
who
did
not
defile
their
garments
and
they
will
walk
with
me
in
white
ones
because
they
are
worthy
5
The
one
who
conquers
will
thus
be
dressed
in
white
garments
and
I
will
by
no
means
blot
out
his
name
from
the
book
of
life
but
I
will
acknowledge
his
name
before
my
Father
and
before
his
angels
6
Let
the
one
who
has
an
ear
hear
what
the
spirit
says
to
the
congregations
7
To
the
angel
of
the
congregation
in
Philadelphia
write
These
are
the
things
he
says
who
is
holy
who
is
true
who
has
the
key
of
David
who
opens
so
that
no
one
will
shut
and
shuts
so
that
no
one
opens
8
I
know
your
deeds—look
I
have
set
before
you
an
opened
door
which
no
one
can
shut
And
I
know
that
you
have
a
little
power
and
you
kept
my
word
and
did
not
prove
false
to
my
name
9
Look
I
will
make
those
from
the
synagogue
of
Satan
who
say
they
are
Jews
yet
are
not
but
are
lying—look
I
will
make
them
come
and
bow
before
your
feet
and
make
them
know
that
I
have
loved
you
10
Because
you
kept
the
word
about
my
endurance
I
will
also
keep
you
from
the
hour
of
test
which
is
to
come
upon
the
entire
inhabited
earth
to
put
to
the
test
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
11
I
am
coming
quickly
Keep
holding
fast
to
what
you
have
so
that
no
one
may
take
your
crown
12
The
one
who
conquers—I
will
make
him
a
pillar
in
the
temple
of
my
God
and
he
will
by
no
means
go
out
from
it
anymore
and
I
will
write
upon
him
the
name
of
my
God
and
the
name
of
the
city
of
my
God
the
New
Jerusalem
that
descends
out
of
heaven
from
my
God
and
my
own
new
name
13
Let
the
one
who
has
an
ear
hear
what
the
spirit
says
to
the
congregations
14
To
the
angel
of
the
congregation
in
Laodicea
write
These
are
the
things
that
the
Amen
says
the
faithful
and
true
witness
the
beginning
of
the
creation
by
God
15
I
know
your
deeds
that
you
are
neither
cold
nor
hot
I
wish
you
were
cold
or
else
hot
16
So
because
you
are
lukewarm
and
neither
hot
nor
cold
I
am
going
to
vomit
you
out
of
my
mouth
17
Because
you
say
I
am
rich
and
have
acquired
riches
and
do
not
need
anything
at
all

but
you
do
not
know
that
you
are
miserable
and
pitiful
and
poor
and
blind
and
naked
18
I
advise
you
to
buy
from
me
gold
refined
by
fire
so
that
you
may
become
rich
and
white
garments
so
that
you
may
become
dressed
and
that
the
shame
of
your
nakedness
may
not
be
exposed
and
eyesalve
to
rub
in
your
eyes
so
that
you
may
see
19
All
those
for
whom
I
have
affection
I
reprove
and
discipline
So
be
zealous
and
repent
20
Look
I
am
standing
at
the
door
and
knocking
If
anyone
hears
my
voice
and
opens
the
door
I
will
come
into
his
house
and
take
the
evening
meal
with
him
and
he
with
me
21
To
the
one
who
conquers
I
will
grant
to
sit
down
with
me
on
my
throne
just
as
I
conquered
and
sat
down
with
my
Father
on
his
throne
22
Let
the
one
who
has
an
ear
hear
what
the
spirit
says
to
the
congregations
1
After
this
I
saw
and
look
an
opened
door
in
heaven
and
the
first
voice
that
I
heard
speaking
with
me
was
like
a
trumpet
saying
Come
up
here
and
I
will
show
you
the
things
that
must
take
place
2
After
this
I
immediately
came
to
be
in
the
power
of
the
spirit
and
look
a
throne
was
in
its
position
in
heaven
and
someone
was
seated
on
the
throne
3
And
the
One
seated
had
the
appearance
of
a
jasper
stone
and
a
sardius
stone
and
all
around
the
throne
was
a
rainbow
like
an
emerald
in
appearance
4
All
around
the
throne
were
24
thrones
and
on
these
thrones
I
saw
seated
24
elders
dressed
in
white
garments
and
on
their
heads
golden
crowns
5
From
the
throne
were
coming
lightning
and
voices
and
thunders
and
there
were
seven
lamps
of
fire
burning
before
the
throne
and
these
mean
the
seven
spirits
of
God
6
Before
the
throne
was
something
resembling
a
glassy
sea
like
crystal
In
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
around
the
throne
were
four
living
creatures
that
were
full
of
eyes
in
front
and
behind
7
The
first
living
creature
was
like
a
lion
and
the
second
living
creature
was
like
a
young
bull
and
the
third
living
creature
had
a
face
like
a
mans
and
the
fourth
living
creature
was
like
a
flying
eagle
8
As
for
the
four
living
creatures
each
one
of
them
had
six
wings
they
were
full
of
eyes
all
around
and
underneath
And
continuously
day
and
night
they
say
Holy
holy
holy
is
Jehovah
God
the
Almighty
who
was
and
who
is
and
who
is
coming
9
Whenever
the
living
creatures
give
glory
and
honor
and
thanksgiving
to
the
One
seated
on
the
throne
the
One
who
lives
forever
and
ever
10
the
24
elders
fall
down
before
the
One
seated
on
the
throne
and
worship
the
One
who
lives
forever
and
ever
and
they
cast
their
crowns
before
the
throne
saying
11
You
are
worthy
Jehovah
our
God
to
receive
the
glory
and
the
honor
and
the
power
because
you
created
all
things
and
because
of
your
will
they
came
into
existence
and
were
created
1
And
I
saw
in
the
right
hand
of
the
One
seated
on
the
throne
a
scroll
written
on
both
sides
sealed
tight
with
seven
seals
2
And
I
saw
a
strong
angel
proclaiming
with
a
loud
voice
Who
is
worthy
to
open
the
scroll
and
break
its
seals
3
But
no
one
in
heaven
or
on
earth
or
underneath
the
earth
was
able
to
open
the
scroll
or
to
look
into
it
4
I
gave
way
to
a
great
deal
of
weeping
because
no
one
was
found
worthy
to
open
the
scroll
or
to
look
into
it
5
But
one
of
the
elders
said
to
me
Stop
weeping
Look
The
Lion
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
the
root
of
David
has
conquered
so
as
to
open
the
scroll
and
its
seven
seals
6
And
I
saw
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
of
the
four
living
creatures
and
in
the
midst
of
the
elders
a
lamb
that
seemed
to
have
been
slaughtered
having
seven
horns
and
seven
eyes
and
the
eyes
mean
the
seven
spirits
of
God
that
have
been
sent
out
into
the
whole
earth
7
At
once
he
came
forward
and
took
it
out
of
the
right
hand
of
the
One
seated
on
the
throne
8
When
he
took
the
scroll
the
four
living
creatures
and
the
24
elders
fell
down
before
the
Lamb
and
each
one
had
a
harp
and
golden
bowls
that
were
full
of
incense
The
incense
means
the
prayers
of
the
holy
ones
9
And
they
sing
a
new
song
saying
You
are
worthy
to
take
the
scroll
and
open
its
seals
for
you
were
slaughtered
and
with
your
blood
you
bought
people
for
God
out
of
every
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
10
and
you
made
them
to
be
a
kingdom
and
priests
to
our
God
and
they
are
to
rule
as
kings
over
the
earth
11
And
I
saw
and
I
heard
a
voice
of
many
angels
around
the
throne
and
the
living
creatures
and
the
elders
and
the
number
of
them
was
myriads
of
myriads
and
thousands
of
thousands
12
and
they
were
saying
with
a
loud
voice
The
Lamb
who
was
slaughtered
is
worthy
to
receive
the
power
and
riches
and
wisdom
and
strength
and
honor
and
glory
and
blessing
13
And
I
heard
every
creature
in
heaven
and
on
earth
and
underneath
the
earth
and
on
the
sea
and
all
the
things
in
them
saying
To
the
One
sitting
on
the
throne
and
to
the
Lamb
be
the
blessing
and
the
honor
and
the
glory
and
the
might
forever
and
ever
14
The
four
living
creatures
were
saying
Amen
and
the
elders
fell
down
and
worshipped
1
And
I
saw
when
the
Lamb
opened
one
of
the
seven
seals
and
I
heard
one
of
the
four
living
creatures
say
with
a
voice
like
thunder
Come
2
And
I
saw
and
look
a
white
horse
and
the
one
seated
on
it
had
a
bow
and
a
crown
was
given
him
and
he
went
out
conquering
and
to
complete
his
conquest
3
When
he
opened
the
second
seal
I
heard
the
second
living
creature
say
Come
4
Another
came
out
a
fiery-colored
horse
and
it
was
granted
to
the
one
seated
on
it
to
take
peace
away
from
the
earth
so
that
they
should
slaughter
one
another
and
he
was
given
a
great
sword
5
When
he
opened
the
third
seal
I
heard
the
third
living
creature
say
Come
And
I
saw
and
look
a
black
horse
and
the
one
seated
on
it
had
a
pair
of
scales
in
his
hand
6
I
heard
what
sounded
like
a
voice
in
the
midst
of
the
four
living
creatures
say
A
quart
of
wheat
for
a
denarius
and
three
quarts
of
barley
for
a
denarius
and
do
not
harm
the
olive
oil
and
the
wine
7
When
he
opened
the
fourth
seal
I
heard
the
voice
of
the
fourth
living
creature
say
Come
8
And
I
saw
and
look
a
pale
horse
and
the
one
seated
on
it
had
the
name
Death
And
the
Grave
was
closely
following
him
And
authority
was
given
them
over
the
fourth
part
of
the
earth
to
kill
with
a
long
sword
and
with
food
shortage
and
with
deadly
plague
and
by
the
wild
beasts
of
the
earth
9
When
he
opened
the
fifth
seal
I
saw
underneath
the
altar
the
souls
of
those
slaughtered
because
of
the
word
of
God
and
because
of
the
witness
they
had
given
10
They
shouted
with
a
loud
voice
saying
Until
when
Sovereign
Lord
holy
and
true
are
you
refraining
from
judging
and
avenging
our
blood
on
those
who
dwell
on
the
earth
11
And
a
white
robe
was
given
to
each
of
them
and
they
were
told
to
rest
a
little
while
longer
until
the
number
was
filled
of
their
fellow
slaves
and
their
brothers
who
were
about
to
be
killed
as
they
had
been
12
And
I
saw
when
he
opened
the
sixth
seal
and
a
great
earthquake
occurred
and
the
sun
became
black
as
sackcloth
made
of
hair
and
the
entire
moon
became
as
blood
13
and
the
stars
of
heaven
fell
to
the
earth
as
when
a
fig
tree
shaken
by
a
high
wind
drops
its
unripe
figs
14
And
the
heaven
departed
as
a
scroll
that
is
being
rolled
up
and
every
mountain
and
every
island
was
removed
from
its
place
15
Then
the
kings
of
the
earth
the
high
officials
the
military
commanders
the
rich
the
strong
every
slave
and
every
free
person
hid
in
the
caves
and
among
the
rocks
of
the
mountains
16
And
they
keep
saying
to
the
mountains
and
to
the
rocks
Fall
over
us
and
hide
us
from
the
face
of
the
One
seated
on
the
throne
and
from
the
wrath
of
the
Lamb
17
because
the
great
day
of
their
wrath
has
come
and
who
is
able
to
stand
1
After
this
I
saw
four
angels
standing
on
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
holding
tight
the
four
winds
of
the
earth
so
that
no
wind
could
blow
on
the
earth
or
on
the
sea
or
on
any
tree
2
And
I
saw
another
angel
ascending
from
the
sunrise
having
a
seal
of
the
living
God
and
he
called
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
four
angels
to
whom
it
was
granted
to
harm
the
earth
and
the
sea
3
saying
Do
not
harm
the
earth
or
the
sea
or
the
trees
until
after
we
have
sealed
the
slaves
of
our
God
in
their
foreheads
4
And
I
heard
the
number
of
those
who
were
sealed
144000
sealed
out
of
every
tribe
of
the
sons
of
Israel
5
Out
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
12000
sealed
out
of
the
tribe
of
Reuben
12000
out
of
the
tribe
of
Gad
12000
6
out
of
the
tribe
of
Asher
12000
out
of
the
tribe
of
Naphtali
12000
out
of
the
tribe
of
Manasseh
12000
7
out
of
the
tribe
of
Simeon
12000
out
of
the
tribe
of
Levi
12000
out
of
the
tribe
of
Issachar
12000
8
out
of
the
tribe
of
Zebulun
12000
out
of
the
tribe
of
Joseph
12000
out
of
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
12000
sealed
9
After
this
I
saw
and
look
a
great
crowd
which
no
man
was
able
to
number
out
of
all
nations
and
tribes
and
peoples
and
tongues
standing
before
the
throne
and
before
the
Lamb
dressed
in
white
robes
and
there
were
palm
branches
in
their
hands
10
And
they
keep
shouting
with
a
loud
voice
saying
Salvation
we
owe
to
our
God
who
is
seated
on
the
throne
and
to
the
Lamb
11
All
the
angels
were
standing
around
the
throne
and
the
elders
and
the
four
living
creatures
and
they
fell
facedown
before
the
throne
and
worshipped
God
12
saying
Amen
Let
the
praise
and
the
glory
and
the
wisdom
and
the
thanksgiving
and
the
honor
and
the
power
and
the
strength
be
to
our
God
forever
and
ever
Amen
13
In
response
one
of
the
elders
said
to
me
These
who
are
dressed
in
the
white
robes
who
are
they
and
where
did
they
come
from
14
So
right
away
I
said
to
him
My
lord
you
are
the
one
who
knows
And
he
said
to
me
These
are
the
ones
who
come
out
of
the
great
tribulation
and
they
have
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
15
That
is
why
they
are
before
the
throne
of
God
and
they
are
rendering
him
sacred
service
day
and
night
in
his
temple
and
the
One
seated
on
the
throne
will
spread
his
tent
over
them
16
They
will
hunger
no
more
nor
thirst
anymore
neither
will
the
sun
beat
down
on
them
nor
any
scorching
heat
17
because
the
Lamb
who
is
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
will
shepherd
them
and
will
guide
them
to
springs
of
waters
of
life
And
God
will
wipe
out
every
tear
from
their
eyes
1
When
he
opened
the
seventh
seal
there
was
silence
in
heaven
for
about
half
an
hour
2
And
I
saw
the
seven
angels
who
stand
before
God
and
seven
trumpets
were
given
to
them
3
Another
angel
holding
a
golden
incense
vessel
arrived
and
stood
at
the
altar
and
a
large
quantity
of
incense
was
given
him
to
offer
it
with
the
prayers
of
all
the
holy
ones
on
the
golden
altar
that
was
before
the
throne
4
The
smoke
of
the
incense
from
the
hand
of
the
angel
ascended
with
the
prayers
of
the
holy
ones
before
God
5
But
right
away
the
angel
took
the
incense
vessel
and
he
filled
it
with
some
of
the
fire
of
the
altar
and
hurled
it
to
the
earth
And
there
were
thunders
and
voices
and
flashes
of
lightning
and
an
earthquake
6
And
the
seven
angels
with
the
seven
trumpets
prepared
to
blow
them
7
The
first
one
blew
his
trumpet
And
there
was
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
blood
and
it
was
hurled
to
the
earth
and
a
third
of
the
earth
was
burned
up
and
a
third
of
the
trees
were
burned
up
and
all
the
green
vegetation
was
burned
up
8
The
second
angel
blew
his
trumpet
And
something
like
a
great
mountain
burning
with
fire
was
hurled
into
the
sea
And
a
third
of
the
sea
became
blood
9
and
a
third
of
the
living
creatures
in
the
sea
died
and
a
third
of
the
ships
were
wrecked
10
The
third
angel
blew
his
trumpet
And
a
great
star
burning
like
a
lamp
fell
from
heaven
and
it
fell
on
a
third
of
the
rivers
and
on
the
springs
of
waters
11
The
name
of
the
star
is
Wormwood
And
a
third
of
the
waters
turned
into
wormwood
and
many
of
the
people
died
from
the
waters
because
these
had
been
made
bitter
12
The
fourth
angel
blew
his
trumpet
And
a
third
of
the
sun
was
struck
and
a
third
of
the
moon
and
a
third
of
the
stars
in
order
that
a
third
of
them
might
be
darkened
and
the
day
might
not
have
light
for
a
third
of
it
and
the
night
likewise
13
And
I
saw
and
I
heard
an
eagle
flying
in
midheaven
say
with
a
loud
voice
Woe
woe
woe
to
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
because
of
the
rest
of
the
trumpet
blasts
of
the
three
angels
who
are
about
to
blow
their
trumpets
1
The
fifth
angel
blew
his
trumpet
And
I
saw
a
star
that
had
fallen
from
heaven
to
the
earth
and
the
key
to
the
shaft
of
the
abyss
was
given
to
him
2
He
opened
the
shaft
of
the
abyss
and
smoke
ascended
out
of
the
shaft
like
the
smoke
of
a
great
furnace
and
the
sun
was
darkened
also
the
air
by
the
smoke
of
the
shaft
3
And
locusts
came
out
of
the
smoke
onto
the
earth
and
authority
was
given
to
them
the
same
authority
that
the
scorpions
of
the
earth
have
4
They
were
told
not
to
harm
the
vegetation
of
the
earth
or
any
green
plant
or
any
tree
but
only
those
people
who
do
not
have
the
seal
of
God
on
their
foreheads
5
And
it
was
granted
the
locusts
not
to
kill
them
but
to
torment
them
five
months
and
their
torment
was
like
torment
by
a
scorpion
when
it
strikes
a
person
6
In
those
days
people
will
seek
death
but
will
by
no
means
find
it
and
they
will
long
to
die
but
death
will
flee
from
them
7
And
in
appearance
the
locusts
resembled
horses
prepared
for
battle
on
their
heads
were
what
seemed
to
be
crowns
of
gold
and
their
faces
were
like
human
faces
8
but
they
had
hair
like
womens
hair
And
their
teeth
were
like
those
of
lions
9
and
they
had
breastplates
like
iron
breastplates
And
the
sound
of
their
wings
was
like
the
sound
of
horse-drawn
chariots
rushing
into
battle
10
Also
they
have
tails
with
stingers
like
scorpions
and
in
their
tails
is
their
authority
to
hurt
the
people
for
five
months
11
They
have
over
them
a
king
the
angel
of
the
abyss
In
Hebrew
his
name
is
Abaddon
but
in
Greek
he
has
the
name
Apollyon
12
The
one
woe
is
past
Look
Two
more
woes
are
coming
after
these
things
13
The
sixth
angel
blew
his
trumpet
And
I
heard
one
voice
from
the
horns
of
the
golden
altar
that
is
before
God
14
say
to
the
sixth
angel
who
had
the
trumpet
Untie
the
four
angels
who
are
bound
at
the
great
river
Euphrates
15
And
the
four
angels
who
have
been
prepared
for
the
hour
and
day
and
month
and
year
were
untied
to
kill
a
third
of
the
people
16
The
number
of
the
armies
of
cavalry
was
two
myriads
of
myriads
I
heard
the
number
of
them
17
And
this
is
how
I
saw
the
horses
in
the
vision
and
those
seated
on
them
They
had
fire-red
and
hyacinth-blue
and
sulfur-yellow
breastplates
and
the
heads
of
the
horses
were
like
the
heads
of
lions
and
fire
and
smoke
and
sulfur
came
out
of
their
mouths
18
A
third
of
the
people
were
killed
by
these
three
plagues
by
the
fire
and
the
smoke
and
the
sulfur
that
came
out
of
their
mouths
19
For
the
authority
of
the
horses
is
in
their
mouths
and
in
their
tails
for
their
tails
are
like
serpents
and
have
heads
and
with
these
they
inflict
harm
20
But
the
rest
of
the
people
who
were
not
killed
by
these
plagues
did
not
repent
of
the
works
of
their
hands
they
did
not
stop
worshipping
the
demons
and
the
idols
of
gold
and
silver
and
copper
and
stone
and
wood
which
can
neither
see
nor
hear
nor
walk
21
And
they
did
not
repent
of
their
murders
nor
of
their
spiritistic
practices
nor
of
their
sexual
immorality
nor
of
their
thefts
1
And
I
saw
another
strong
angel
descending
from
heaven
arrayed
with
a
cloud
and
a
rainbow
was
on
his
head
and
his
face
was
like
the
sun
and
his
legs
were
like
pillars
of
fire
2
and
he
had
in
his
hand
a
little
scroll
that
had
been
unrolled
And
he
set
his
right
foot
on
the
sea
but
his
left
one
on
the
earth
3
and
he
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
just
as
when
a
lion
roars
And
when
he
cried
out
the
voices
of
the
seven
thunders
spoke
4
Now
when
the
seven
thunders
spoke
I
was
about
to
write
but
I
heard
a
voice
out
of
heaven
say
Seal
up
the
things
the
seven
thunders
spoke
and
do
not
write
them
down
5
The
angel
whom
I
saw
standing
on
the
sea
and
on
the
earth
raised
his
right
hand
to
heaven
6
and
he
swore
by
the
One
who
lives
forever
and
ever
who
created
the
heaven
and
the
things
in
it
and
the
earth
and
the
things
in
it
and
the
sea
and
the
things
in
it
There
will
be
no
delay
any
longer
7
But
in
the
days
when
the
seventh
angel
is
about
to
blow
his
trumpet
the
sacred
secret
that
God
declared
as
good
news
to
his
own
slaves
the
prophets
is
indeed
brought
to
a
finish
8
And
I
heard
the
voice
out
of
heaven
speaking
again
with
me
and
saying
Go
take
the
opened
scroll
that
is
in
the
hand
of
the
angel
who
is
standing
on
the
sea
and
on
the
earth
9
I
went
to
the
angel
and
told
him
to
give
me
the
little
scroll
He
said
to
me
Take
it
and
eat
it
up
and
it
will
make
your
stomach
bitter
but
in
your
mouth
it
will
be
sweet
like
honey
10
I
took
the
little
scroll
out
of
the
hand
of
the
angel
and
ate
it
and
in
my
mouth
it
was
sweet
like
honey
but
when
I
had
eaten
it
my
stomach
was
made
bitter
11
And
they
said
to
me
You
must
prophesy
again
about
peoples
and
nations
and
tongues
and
many
kings
1
And
a
reed
like
a
rod
was
given
to
me
as
he
said
Get
up
and
measure
the
temple
sanctuary
of
God
and
the
altar
and
those
worshipping
in
it
2
But
as
for
the
courtyard
that
is
outside
the
temple
sanctuary
leave
it
out
and
do
not
measure
it
because
it
has
been
given
to
the
nations
and
they
will
trample
the
holy
city
underfoot
for
42
months
3
I
will
cause
my
two
witnesses
to
prophesy
for
1260
days
dressed
in
sackcloth
4
These
are
symbolized
by
the
two
olive
trees
and
the
two
lampstands
and
are
standing
before
the
Lord
of
the
earth
5
If
anyone
wants
to
harm
them
fire
comes
out
of
their
mouths
and
consumes
their
enemies
If
anyone
should
want
to
harm
them
this
is
how
he
must
be
killed
6
These
have
the
authority
to
shut
up
the
sky
so
that
no
rain
may
fall
during
the
days
of
their
prophesying
and
they
have
authority
over
the
waters
to
turn
them
into
blood
and
to
strike
the
earth
with
every
sort
of
plague
as
often
as
they
wish
7
When
they
have
finished
their
witnessing
the
wild
beast
that
ascends
out
of
the
abyss
will
wage
war
with
them
and
conquer
them
and
kill
them
8
And
their
corpses
will
be
on
the
main
street
of
the
great
city
that
is
in
a
spiritual
sense
called
Sodom
and
Egypt
where
their
Lord
was
also
executed
on
the
stake
9
And
those
of
the
peoples
and
tribes
and
tongues
and
nations
will
look
at
their
corpses
for
three
and
a
half
days
and
they
do
not
allow
their
corpses
to
be
laid
in
a
tomb
10
And
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
rejoice
over
them
and
celebrate
and
they
will
send
gifts
to
one
another
because
these
two
prophets
tormented
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
11
After
the
three
and
a
half
days
spirit
of
life
from
God
entered
into
them
and
they
stood
on
their
feet
and
great
fear
fell
upon
those
who
saw
them
12
And
they
heard
a
loud
voice
from
heaven
say
to
them
Come
up
here
And
they
went
up
into
heaven
in
the
cloud
and
their
enemies
saw
them
13
In
that
hour
there
was
a
great
earthquake
and
a
tenth
of
the
city
fell
and
7000
persons
were
killed
by
the
earthquake
and
the
rest
became
frightened
and
gave
glory
to
the
God
of
heaven
14
The
second
woe
is
past
Look
The
third
woe
is
coming
quickly
15
The
seventh
angel
blew
his
trumpet
And
there
were
loud
voices
in
heaven
saying
The
kingdom
of
the
world
has
become
the
Kingdom
of
our
Lord
and
of
his
Christ
and
he
will
rule
as
king
forever
and
ever
16
And
the
24
elders
who
were
seated
before
God
on
their
thrones
fell
upon
their
faces
and
worshipped
God
17
saying
We
thank
you
Jehovah
God
the
Almighty
the
one
who
is
and
who
was
because
you
have
taken
your
great
power
and
begun
ruling
as
king
18
But
the
nations
became
wrathful
and
your
own
wrath
came
and
the
appointed
time
came
for
the
dead
to
be
judged
and
to
reward
your
slaves
the
prophets
and
the
holy
ones
and
those
fearing
your
name
the
small
and
the
great
and
to
bring
to
ruin
those
ruining
the
earth
19
And
the
temple
sanctuary
of
God
in
heaven
was
opened
and
the
ark
of
his
covenant
was
seen
in
his
temple
sanctuary
And
there
were
flashes
of
lightning
and
voices
and
thunders
and
an
earthquake
and
a
great
hail
1
Then
a
great
sign
was
seen
in
heaven
A
woman
was
arrayed
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
was
beneath
her
feet
and
on
her
head
was
a
crown
of
12
stars
2
and
she
was
pregnant
And
she
was
crying
out
in
her
pains
and
in
her
agony
to
give
birth
3
Another
sign
was
seen
in
heaven
Look
A
great
fiery-colored
dragon
with
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
on
its
heads
seven
diadems
4
and
its
tail
drags
a
third
of
the
stars
of
heaven
and
it
hurled
them
down
to
the
earth
And
the
dragon
kept
standing
before
the
woman
who
was
about
to
give
birth
so
that
when
she
did
give
birth
it
might
devour
her
child
5
And
she
gave
birth
to
a
son
a
male
who
is
to
shepherd
all
the
nations
with
an
iron
rod
And
her
child
was
snatched
away
to
God
and
to
his
throne
6
And
the
woman
fled
into
the
wilderness
where
she
has
a
place
prepared
by
God
and
where
they
would
feed
her
for
1260
days
7
And
war
broke
out
in
heaven
Michael
and
his
angels
battled
with
the
dragon
and
the
dragon
and
its
angels
battled
8
but
they
did
not
prevail
nor
was
a
place
found
for
them
any
longer
in
heaven
9
So
down
the
great
dragon
was
hurled
the
original
serpent
the
one
called
Devil
and
Satan
who
is
misleading
the
entire
inhabited
earth
he
was
hurled
down
to
the
earth
and
his
angels
were
hurled
down
with
him
10
I
heard
a
loud
voice
in
heaven
say
Now
have
come
to
pass
the
salvation
and
the
power
and
the
Kingdom
of
our
God
and
the
authority
of
his
Christ
because
the
accuser
of
our
brothers
has
been
hurled
down
who
accuses
them
day
and
night
before
our
God
11
And
they
conquered
him
because
of
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
and
because
of
the
word
of
their
witnessing
and
they
did
not
love
their
souls
even
in
the
face
of
death
12
On
this
account
be
glad
you
heavens
and
you
who
reside
in
them
Woe
for
the
earth
and
for
the
sea
because
the
Devil
has
come
down
to
you
having
great
anger
knowing
that
he
has
a
short
period
of
time
13
Now
when
the
dragon
saw
that
it
had
been
hurled
down
to
the
earth
it
persecuted
the
woman
who
gave
birth
to
the
male
child
14
But
the
two
wings
of
the
great
eagle
were
given
to
the
woman
so
that
she
might
fly
into
the
wilderness
to
her
place
where
she
is
to
be
fed
for
a
time
and
times
and
half
a
time
away
from
the
face
of
the
serpent
15
And
the
serpent
spewed
out
water
like
a
river
from
its
mouth
after
the
woman
to
cause
her
to
be
drowned
by
the
river
16
But
the
earth
came
to
the
womans
help
and
the
earth
opened
its
mouth
and
swallowed
up
the
river
that
the
dragon
spewed
out
from
its
mouth
17
So
the
dragon
became
enraged
at
the
woman
and
went
off
to
wage
war
with
the
remaining
ones
of
her
offspring
who
observe
the
commandments
of
God
and
have
the
work
of
bearing
witness
concerning
Jesus
1
And
it
stood
still
on
the
sand
of
the
sea
And
I
saw
a
wild
beast
ascending
out
of
the
sea
with
ten
horns
and
seven
heads
and
on
its
horns
ten
diadems
but
on
its
heads
blasphemous
names
2
Now
the
wild
beast
that
I
saw
was
like
a
leopard
but
its
feet
were
like
those
of
a
bear
and
its
mouth
was
like
a
lions
mouth
And
the
dragon
gave
to
the
beast
its
power
and
its
throne
and
great
authority
3
I
saw
that
one
of
its
heads
seemed
to
have
been
fatally
wounded
but
its
mortal
wound
had
been
healed
and
all
the
earth
followed
the
wild
beast
with
admiration
4
And
they
worshipped
the
dragon
because
it
gave
the
authority
to
the
wild
beast
and
they
worshipped
the
wild
beast
with
the
words
Who
is
like
the
wild
beast
and
who
can
do
battle
with
it
5
It
was
given
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
blasphemies
and
it
was
given
authority
to
act
for
42
months
6
And
it
opened
its
mouth
in
blasphemies
against
God
to
blaspheme
his
name
and
his
dwelling
place
even
those
residing
in
heaven
7
It
was
permitted
to
wage
war
with
the
holy
ones
and
conquer
them
and
it
was
given
authority
over
every
tribe
and
people
and
tongue
and
nation
8
And
all
those
who
dwell
on
the
earth
will
worship
it
From
the
founding
of
the
world
not
one
of
their
names
has
been
written
in
the
scroll
of
life
of
the
Lamb
who
was
slaughtered
9
If
anyone
has
an
ear
let
him
hear
10
If
anyone
is
meant
for
captivity
he
will
go
into
captivity
If
anyone
will
kill
with
the
sword
he
must
be
killed
with
the
sword
This
is
where
it
calls
for
endurance
and
faith
on
the
part
of
the
holy
ones
11
Then
I
saw
another
wild
beast
ascending
out
of
the
earth
and
it
had
two
horns
like
a
lamb
but
it
began
speaking
like
a
dragon
12
It
exercises
all
the
authority
of
the
first
wild
beast
in
its
sight
And
it
makes
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
worship
the
first
wild
beast
whose
mortal
wound
was
healed
13
And
it
performs
great
signs
even
making
fire
come
down
out
of
heaven
to
the
earth
in
the
sight
of
mankind
14
It
misleads
those
who
dwell
on
the
earth
because
of
the
signs
that
it
was
permitted
to
perform
in
the
sight
of
the
wild
beast
while
it
tells
those
who
dwell
on
the
earth
to
make
an
image
to
the
wild
beast
that
had
the
sword-stroke
and
yet
revived
15
And
it
was
permitted
to
give
breath
to
the
image
of
the
wild
beast
so
that
the
image
of
the
wild
beast
should
both
speak
and
cause
to
be
killed
all
those
who
refuse
to
worship
the
image
of
the
wild
beast
16
It
puts
under
compulsion
all
people—the
small
and
the
great
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
free
and
the
slaves—that
these
should
be
marked
on
their
right
hand
or
on
their
forehead
17
and
that
nobody
can
buy
or
sell
except
a
person
having
the
mark
the
name
of
the
wild
beast
or
the
number
of
its
name
18
This
is
where
it
calls
for
wisdom
Let
the
one
who
has
insight
calculate
the
number
of
the
wild
beast
for
it
is
a
mans
number
and
its
number
is
666
1
Then
I
saw
and
look
the
Lamb
standing
on
Mount
Zion
and
with
him
144000
who
have
his
name
and
the
name
of
his
Father
written
on
their
foreheads
2
I
heard
a
sound
coming
out
of
heaven
like
the
sound
of
many
waters
and
like
the
sound
of
loud
thunder
and
the
sound
that
I
heard
was
like
singers
who
accompany
themselves
by
playing
on
their
harps
3
And
they
are
singing
what
seems
to
be
a
new
song
before
the
throne
and
before
the
four
living
creatures
and
the
elders
and
no
one
was
able
to
master
that
song
except
the
144000
who
have
been
bought
from
the
earth
4
These
are
the
ones
who
did
not
defile
themselves
with
women
in
fact
they
are
virgins
These
are
the
ones
who
keep
following
the
Lamb
no
matter
where
he
goes
These
were
bought
from
among
mankind
as
firstfruits
to
God
and
to
the
Lamb
5
and
no
deceit
was
found
in
their
mouths
they
are
without
blemish
6
And
I
saw
another
angel
flying
in
midheaven
and
he
had
everlasting
good
news
to
declare
to
those
who
dwell
on
the
earth
to
every
nation
and
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
7
He
was
saying
in
a
loud
voice
Fear
God
and
give
him
glory
because
the
hour
of
judgment
by
him
has
arrived
so
worship
the
One
who
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
springs
of
water
8
Another
a
second
angel
followed
saying
She
has
fallen
Babylon
the
Great
has
fallen
she
who
made
all
the
nations
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
passion
of
her
sexual
immorality
9
Another
angel
a
third
followed
them
saying
in
a
loud
voice
If
anyone
worships
the
wild
beast
and
its
image
and
receives
a
mark
on
his
forehead
or
on
his
hand
10
he
will
also
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
anger
of
God
that
is
poured
out
undiluted
into
the
cup
of
His
wrath
and
he
will
be
tormented
with
fire
and
sulfur
in
the
sight
of
the
holy
angels
and
in
the
sight
of
the
Lamb
11
And
the
smoke
of
their
torment
ascends
forever
and
ever
and
day
and
night
they
have
no
rest
those
who
worship
the
wild
beast
and
its
image
and
whoever
receives
the
mark
of
its
name
12
Here
is
where
it
calls
for
endurance
on
the
part
of
the
holy
ones
those
who
keep
the
commandments
of
God
and
hold
fast
to
the
faith
of
Jesus
13
And
I
heard
a
voice
out
of
heaven
say
Write
Happy
are
the
dead
who
die
in
union
with
the
Lord
from
this
time
onward
Yes
says
the
spirit
let
them
rest
from
their
labors
for
the
things
they
did
go
right
with
them
14
Then
I
saw
and
look
a
white
cloud
and
seated
on
the
cloud
was
someone
like
a
son
of
man
with
a
golden
crown
on
his
head
and
a
sharp
sickle
in
his
hand
15
Another
angel
emerged
from
the
temple
sanctuary
calling
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
one
seated
on
the
cloud
Put
your
sickle
in
and
reap
because
the
hour
has
come
to
reap
for
the
harvest
of
the
earth
is
fully
ripe
16
And
the
one
seated
on
the
cloud
thrust
his
sickle
into
the
earth
and
the
earth
was
reaped
17
And
still
another
angel
emerged
from
the
temple
sanctuary
that
is
in
heaven
and
he
also
had
a
sharp
sickle
18
And
still
another
angel
emerged
from
the
altar
and
he
had
authority
over
the
fire
And
he
called
out
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
one
who
had
the
sharp
sickle
saying
Put
your
sharp
sickle
in
and
gather
the
clusters
of
the
vine
of
the
earth
for
its
grapes
have
become
ripe
19
The
angel
thrust
his
sickle
into
the
earth
and
gathered
the
vine
of
the
earth
and
he
hurled
it
into
the
great
winepress
of
Gods
anger
20
The
winepress
was
trodden
outside
the
city
and
blood
came
out
of
the
winepress
as
high
up
as
the
bridles
of
the
horses
for
a
distance
of
1600
stadia
1
And
I
saw
in
heaven
another
sign
great
and
wonderful
seven
angels
with
seven
plagues
These
are
the
last
ones
because
by
means
of
them
the
anger
of
God
is
brought
to
a
finish
2
And
I
saw
something
like
a
sea
of
glass
mingled
with
fire
and
those
who
are
victorious
over
the
wild
beast
and
its
image
and
the
number
of
its
name
were
standing
by
the
sea
of
glass
holding
harps
of
God
3
They
were
singing
the
song
of
Moses
the
slave
of
God
and
the
song
of
the
Lamb
saying
Great
and
wonderful
are
your
works
Jehovah
God
the
Almighty
Righteous
and
true
are
your
ways
King
of
eternity
4
Who
will
not
really
fear
you
Jehovah
and
glorify
your
name
for
you
alone
are
loyal
For
all
the
nations
will
come
and
worship
before
you
because
your
righteous
decrees
have
been
revealed
5
After
this
I
saw
and
the
sanctuary
of
the
tent
of
the
witness
was
opened
in
heaven
6
and
the
seven
angels
with
the
seven
plagues
emerged
from
the
sanctuary
clothed
with
clean
bright
linen
and
with
golden
sashes
wrapped
around
their
chests
7
One
of
the
four
living
creatures
gave
the
seven
angels
seven
golden
bowls
that
were
full
of
the
anger
of
God
who
lives
forever
and
ever
8
And
the
sanctuary
became
filled
with
smoke
because
of
the
glory
of
God
and
because
of
his
power
and
no
one
was
able
to
enter
the
sanctuary
until
the
seven
plagues
of
the
seven
angels
were
finished
1
And
I
heard
a
loud
voice
out
of
the
sanctuary
say
to
the
seven
angels
Go
and
pour
out
the
seven
bowls
of
the
anger
of
God
on
the
earth
2
The
first
one
went
off
and
poured
out
his
bowl
on
the
earth
And
a
hurtful
and
malignant
ulcer
afflicted
the
people
who
had
the
mark
of
the
wild
beast
and
who
were
worshipping
its
image
3
The
second
one
poured
out
his
bowl
into
the
sea
And
it
became
blood
like
that
of
a
dead
man
and
every
living
creature
died
yes
the
things
in
the
sea
4
The
third
one
poured
out
his
bowl
into
the
rivers
and
the
springs
of
water
And
they
became
blood
5
I
heard
the
angel
over
the
waters
say
You
the
One
who
is
and
who
was
the
loyal
One
are
righteous
for
you
have
issued
these
judgments
6
because
they
poured
out
the
blood
of
holy
ones
and
of
prophets
and
you
have
given
them
blood
to
drink
they
deserve
it
7
And
I
heard
the
altar
say
Yes
Jehovah
God
the
Almighty
true
and
righteous
are
your
judgments
8
The
fourth
one
poured
out
his
bowl
on
the
sun
and
to
the
sun
it
was
granted
to
scorch
the
people
with
fire
9
And
the
people
were
scorched
by
the
great
heat
but
they
blasphemed
the
name
of
God
who
has
the
authority
over
these
plagues
and
they
did
not
repent
and
give
glory
to
him
10
The
fifth
one
poured
out
his
bowl
on
the
throne
of
the
wild
beast
And
its
kingdom
became
darkened
and
they
began
to
gnaw
their
tongues
because
of
their
pain
11
but
they
blasphemed
the
God
of
heaven
because
of
their
pains
and
their
ulcers
and
they
did
not
repent
of
their
works
12
The
sixth
one
poured
out
his
bowl
on
the
great
river
Euphrates
and
its
water
was
dried
up
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
kings
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
13
And
I
saw
three
unclean
inspired
expressions
that
looked
like
frogs
come
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
dragon
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
wild
beast
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
false
prophet
14
They
are
in
fact
expressions
inspired
by
demons
and
they
perform
signs
and
they
go
out
to
the
kings
of
the
entire
inhabited
earth
to
gather
them
together
to
the
war
of
the
great
day
of
God
the
Almighty
15
Look
I
am
coming
as
a
thief
Happy
is
the
one
who
stays
awake
and
keeps
his
outer
garments
so
that
he
may
not
walk
naked
and
people
look
upon
his
shamefulness
16
And
they
gathered
them
together
to
the
place
that
is
called
in
Hebrew
Armageddon
17
The
seventh
one
poured
out
his
bowl
on
the
air
At
this
a
loud
voice
came
out
of
the
sanctuary
from
the
throne
saying
It
has
come
to
pass
18
And
there
were
flashes
of
lightning
and
voices
and
thunders
and
there
was
a
great
earthquake
unlike
any
that
had
occurred
since
men
came
to
be
on
the
earth
so
extensive
and
so
great
was
the
earthquake
19
The
great
city
split
into
three
parts
and
the
cities
of
the
nations
fell
and
Babylon
the
Great
was
remembered
before
God
to
give
her
the
cup
of
the
wine
of
the
fury
of
his
wrath
20
Also
every
island
fled
and
mountains
were
not
found
21
Then
great
hailstones
each
about
the
weight
of
a
talent
fell
from
heaven
on
the
people
and
the
people
blasphemed
God
because
of
the
plague
of
hail
for
the
plague
was
unusually
great
1
One
of
the
seven
angels
who
had
the
seven
bowls
came
and
said
to
me
Come
I
will
show
you
the
judgment
on
the
great
prostitute
who
sits
on
many
waters
2
with
whom
the
kings
of
the
earth
committed
sexual
immorality
and
earths
inhabitants
were
made
drunk
with
the
wine
of
her
sexual
immorality
3
And
he
carried
me
away
in
the
power
of
the
spirit
into
a
wilderness
And
I
saw
a
woman
sitting
on
a
scarlet-colored
wild
beast
that
was
full
of
blasphemous
names
and
that
had
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
4
The
woman
was
clothed
in
purple
and
scarlet
and
she
was
adorned
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
pearls
and
she
had
in
her
hand
a
golden
cup
that
was
full
of
disgusting
things
and
the
unclean
things
of
her
sexual
immorality
5
On
her
forehead
was
written
a
name
a
mystery
Babylon
the
Great
the
mother
of
the
prostitutes
and
of
the
disgusting
things
of
the
earth
6
And
I
saw
that
the
woman
was
drunk
with
the
blood
of
the
holy
ones
and
with
the
blood
of
the
witnesses
of
Jesus
Well
on
seeing
her
I
was
greatly
amazed
7
So
the
angel
said
to
me
Why
is
it
that
you
were
amazed
I
will
tell
you
the
mystery
of
the
woman
and
of
the
wild
beast
that
is
carrying
her
and
that
has
the
seven
heads
and
the
ten
horns
8
The
wild
beast
that
you
saw
was
but
is
not
and
yet
is
about
to
ascend
out
of
the
abyss
and
it
is
to
go
off
into
destruction
And
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth—those
whose
names
have
not
been
written
in
the
scroll
of
life
from
the
founding
of
the
world—will
be
amazed
when
they
see
how
the
wild
beast
was
but
is
not
and
yet
will
be
present
9
This
calls
for
a
mind
that
has
wisdom
The
seven
heads
mean
seven
mountains
where
the
woman
sits
on
top
10
And
there
are
seven
kings
Five
have
fallen
one
is
and
the
other
has
not
yet
arrived
but
when
he
does
arrive
he
must
remain
a
short
while
11
And
the
wild
beast
that
was
but
is
not
it
is
also
an
eighth
king
but
it
springs
from
the
seven
and
it
goes
off
into
destruction
12
The
ten
horns
that
you
saw
mean
ten
kings
who
have
not
yet
received
a
kingdom
but
they
do
receive
authority
as
kings
for
one
hour
with
the
wild
beast
13
These
have
one
thought
so
they
give
their
power
and
authority
to
the
wild
beast
14
These
will
battle
with
the
Lamb
but
because
he
is
Lord
of
lords
and
King
of
kings
the
Lamb
will
conquer
them
Also
those
with
him
who
are
called
and
chosen
and
faithful
will
do
so
15
He
said
to
me
The
waters
that
you
saw
where
the
prostitute
is
sitting
mean
peoples
and
crowds
and
nations
and
tongues
16
And
the
ten
horns
that
you
saw
and
the
wild
beast
these
will
hate
the
prostitute
and
will
make
her
devastated
and
naked
and
they
will
eat
up
her
flesh
and
completely
burn
her
with
fire
17
For
God
put
it
into
their
hearts
to
carry
out
his
thought
yes
to
carry
out
their
one
thought
by
giving
their
kingdom
to
the
wild
beast
until
the
words
of
God
will
have
been
accomplished
18
And
the
woman
whom
you
saw
means
the
great
city
that
has
a
kingdom
over
the
kings
of
the
earth
1
After
this
I
saw
another
angel
descending
from
heaven
with
great
authority
and
the
earth
was
illuminated
by
his
glory
2
And
he
cried
out
with
a
strong
voice
saying
She
has
fallen
Babylon
the
Great
has
fallen
and
she
has
become
a
dwelling
place
of
demons
and
a
place
where
every
unclean
spirit
and
every
unclean
and
hated
bird
lurks
3
For
because
of
the
wine
of
the
passion
of
her
sexual
immorality
all
the
nations
have
fallen
victim
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
committed
sexual
immorality
with
her
and
the
merchants
of
the
earth
became
rich
owing
to
the
power
of
her
shameless
luxury
4
And
I
heard
another
voice
out
of
heaven
say
Get
out
of
her
my
people
if
you
do
not
want
to
share
with
her
in
her
sins
and
if
you
do
not
want
to
receive
part
of
her
plagues
5
For
her
sins
have
massed
together
clear
up
to
heaven
and
God
has
called
her
acts
of
injustice
to
mind
6
Repay
her
in
the
way
she
treated
others
yes
pay
her
back
double
for
the
things
she
has
done
in
the
cup
she
has
mixed
mix
a
double
portion
for
her
7
To
the
extent
that
she
glorified
herself
and
lived
in
shameless
luxury
to
that
extent
give
her
torment
and
mourning
For
she
keeps
saying
in
her
heart
I
sit
as
queen
and
I
am
not
a
widow
and
I
will
never
see
mourning
8
That
is
why
in
one
day
her
plagues
will
come
death
and
mourning
and
famine
and
she
will
be
completely
burned
with
fire
because
Jehovah
God
who
judged
her
is
strong
9
And
the
kings
of
the
earth
who
committed
sexual
immorality
with
her
and
lived
with
her
in
shameless
luxury
will
weep
and
beat
themselves
in
grief
over
her
when
they
see
the
smoke
from
her
burning
10
They
will
stand
at
a
distance
because
of
their
fear
of
her
torment
and
say
Too
bad
too
bad
you
great
city
Babylon
you
strong
city
because
in
one
hour
your
judgment
has
arrived
11
Also
the
merchants
of
the
earth
are
weeping
and
mourning
over
her
because
there
is
no
one
to
buy
their
full
cargo
anymore
12
a
full
cargo
of
gold
silver
precious
stones
pearls
fine
linen
purple
cloth
silk
and
scarlet
cloth
and
everything
made
from
scented
wood
and
every
sort
of
object
made
from
ivory
and
from
precious
wood
copper
iron
and
marble
13
also
cinnamon
Indian
spice
incense
perfumed
oil
frankincense
wine
olive
oil
fine
flour
wheat
cattle
sheep
horses
carriages
slaves
and
human
lives
14
Yes
the
fine
fruit
that
you
desired
has
left
you
and
all
the
delicacies
and
the
splendid
things
have
vanished
from
you
never
to
be
found
again
15
The
merchants
who
sold
these
things
who
became
rich
from
her
will
stand
at
a
distance
because
of
their
fear
of
her
torment
and
will
weep
and
mourn
16
saying
Too
bad
too
bad
the
great
city
clothed
with
fine
linen
purple
and
scarlet
and
richly
adorned
with
gold
ornaments
precious
stones
and
pearls
17
because
in
one
hour
such
great
riches
have
been
devastated
And
every
ship
captain
and
every
seafaring
person
and
sailors
and
all
those
who
make
a
living
by
the
sea
stood
at
a
distance
18
and
cried
out
as
they
looked
at
the
smoke
from
her
burning
and
said
What
city
is
like
the
great
city
19
They
threw
dust
on
their
heads
and
cried
out
weeping
and
mourning
and
said
Too
bad
too
bad
the
great
city
in
which
all
those
who
had
ships
at
sea
became
rich
from
her
wealth
because
in
one
hour
she
has
been
devastated
20
Be
glad
over
her
O
heaven
also
you
holy
ones
and
apostles
and
prophets
because
God
has
pronounced
his
judgment
on
her
in
your
behalf
21
And
a
strong
angel
lifted
up
a
stone
like
a
great
millstone
and
hurled
it
into
the
sea
saying
Thus
with
a
swift
pitch
will
Babylon
the
great
city
be
hurled
down
and
she
will
never
be
found
again
22
And
the
sound
of
singers
who
accompany
themselves
on
the
harp
of
musicians
of
flutists
and
of
trumpeters
will
never
be
heard
in
you
again
And
no
craftsman
who
practices
any
trade
will
ever
be
found
in
you
again
and
no
sound
of
a
millstone
will
ever
be
heard
in
you
again
23
No
light
of
a
lamp
will
ever
shine
in
you
again
and
no
voice
of
a
bridegroom
and
of
a
bride
will
ever
be
heard
in
you
again
for
your
merchants
were
the
top-ranking
men
of
the
earth
and
by
your
spiritistic
practices
all
the
nations
were
misled
24
Yes
in
her
was
found
the
blood
of
prophets
and
of
holy
ones
and
of
all
those
who
have
been
slaughtered
on
the
earth
1
After
this
I
heard
what
seemed
to
be
a
loud
voice
of
a
great
crowd
in
heaven
They
said
Praise
Jah
The
salvation
and
the
glory
and
the
power
belong
to
our
God
2
because
his
judgments
are
true
and
righteous
For
he
has
executed
judgment
on
the
great
prostitute
who
corrupted
the
earth
with
her
sexual
immorality
and
he
has
avenged
the
blood
of
his
slaves
that
is
on
her
hands
3
And
right
away
for
the
second
time
they
said
Praise
Jah
And
the
smoke
from
her
goes
on
ascending
forever
and
ever
4
And
the
24
elders
and
the
four
living
creatures
fell
down
and
worshipped
God
who
sits
on
the
throne
and
said
Amen
Praise
Jah
5
Also
a
voice
came
from
the
throne
and
said
Be
praising
our
God
all
you
his
slaves
who
fear
him
the
small
ones
and
the
great
6
And
I
heard
what
sounded
like
a
voice
of
a
great
crowd
and
like
the
sound
of
many
waters
and
like
the
sound
of
heavy
thunders
They
said
Praise
Jah
because
Jehovah
our
God
the
Almighty
has
begun
to
rule
as
king
7
Let
us
rejoice
and
be
overjoyed
and
give
him
glory
because
the
marriage
of
the
Lamb
has
arrived
and
his
wife
has
prepared
herself
8
Yes
it
has
been
granted
to
her
to
be
clothed
with
bright
clean
fine
linen—for
the
fine
linen
stands
for
the
righteous
acts
of
the
holy
ones
9
And
he
tells
me
Write
Happy
are
those
invited
to
the
evening
meal
of
the
Lambs
marriage
Also
he
tells
me
These
are
the
true
sayings
of
God
10
At
that
I
fell
down
before
his
feet
to
worship
him
But
he
tells
me
Be
careful
Do
not
do
that
I
am
only
a
fellow
slave
of
you
and
of
your
brothers
who
have
the
work
of
witnessing
concerning
Jesus
Worship
God
For
the
witness
concerning
Jesus
is
what
inspires
prophecy
11
I
saw
heaven
opened
and
look
a
white
horse
And
the
one
seated
on
it
is
called
Faithful
and
True
and
he
judges
and
carries
on
war
in
righteousness
12
His
eyes
are
a
fiery
flame
and
on
his
head
are
many
diadems
He
has
a
name
written
that
no
one
knows
but
he
himself
13
and
he
is
clothed
with
an
outer
garment
stained
with
blood
and
he
is
called
by
the
name
The
Word
of
God
14
Also
the
armies
in
heaven
were
following
him
on
white
horses
and
they
were
clothed
in
white
clean
fine
linen
15
And
out
of
his
mouth
protrudes
a
sharp
long
sword
with
which
to
strike
the
nations
and
he
will
shepherd
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
Moreover
he
treads
the
winepress
of
the
fury
of
the
wrath
of
God
the
Almighty
16
On
his
outer
garment
yes
on
his
thigh
he
has
a
name
written
King
of
kings
and
Lord
of
lords
17
I
saw
also
an
angel
standing
in
the
sun
and
he
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
to
all
the
birds
that
fly
in
midheaven
Come
here
be
gathered
together
to
the
great
evening
meal
of
God
18
so
that
you
may
eat
the
flesh
of
kings
and
the
flesh
of
military
commanders
and
the
flesh
of
strong
men
and
the
flesh
of
horses
and
of
those
seated
on
them
and
the
flesh
of
all
of
freemen
as
well
as
of
slaves
and
of
small
ones
and
great
19
And
I
saw
the
wild
beast
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
their
armies
gathered
together
to
wage
war
against
the
one
seated
on
the
horse
and
against
his
army
20
And
the
wild
beast
was
caught
and
along
with
it
the
false
prophet
that
performed
in
front
of
it
the
signs
with
which
he
misled
those
who
received
the
mark
of
the
wild
beast
and
those
who
worship
its
image
While
still
alive
they
both
were
hurled
into
the
fiery
lake
that
burns
with
sulfur
21
But
the
rest
were
killed
off
with
the
long
sword
that
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
one
seated
on
the
horse
And
all
the
birds
were
filled
with
their
flesh
1
And
I
saw
an
angel
coming
down
out
of
heaven
with
the
key
of
the
abyss
and
a
great
chain
in
his
hand
2
He
seized
the
dragon
the
original
serpent
who
is
the
Devil
and
Satan
and
bound
him
for
1000
years
3
And
he
hurled
him
into
the
abyss
and
shut
it
and
sealed
it
over
him
so
that
he
would
not
mislead
the
nations
anymore
until
the
1000
years
were
ended
After
this
he
must
be
released
for
a
little
while
4
And
I
saw
thrones
and
those
who
sat
on
them
were
given
authority
to
judge
Yes
I
saw
the
souls
of
those
executed
for
the
witness
they
gave
about
Jesus
and
for
speaking
about
God
and
those
who
had
not
worshipped
the
wild
beast
or
its
image
and
had
not
received
the
mark
on
their
forehead
and
on
their
hand
And
they
came
to
life
and
ruled
as
kings
with
the
Christ
for
1000
years
5
The
rest
of
the
dead
did
not
come
to
life
until
the
1000
years
were
ended
This
is
the
first
resurrection
6
Happy
and
holy
is
anyone
having
part
in
the
first
resurrection
over
these
the
second
death
has
no
authority
but
they
will
be
priests
of
God
and
of
the
Christ
and
they
will
rule
as
kings
with
him
for
the
1000
years
7
Now
as
soon
as
the
1000
years
have
ended
Satan
will
be
released
from
his
prison
8
and
he
will
go
out
to
mislead
those
nations
in
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
Gog
and
Magog
to
gather
them
together
for
the
war
The
number
of
these
is
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
9
And
they
advanced
over
the
whole
earth
and
encircled
the
camp
of
the
holy
ones
and
the
beloved
city
But
fire
came
down
out
of
heaven
and
consumed
them
10
And
the
Devil
who
was
misleading
them
was
hurled
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
sulfur
where
both
the
wild
beast
and
the
false
prophet
already
were
and
they
will
be
tormented
day
and
night
forever
and
ever
11
And
I
saw
a
great
white
throne
and
the
One
seated
on
it
From
before
him
the
earth
and
the
heaven
fled
away
and
no
place
was
found
for
them
12
And
I
saw
the
dead
the
great
and
the
small
standing
before
the
throne
and
scrolls
were
opened
But
another
scroll
was
opened
it
is
the
scroll
of
life
The
dead
were
judged
out
of
those
things
written
in
the
scrolls
according
to
their
deeds
13
And
the
sea
gave
up
the
dead
in
it
and
death
and
the
Grave
gave
up
the
dead
in
them
and
they
were
judged
individually
according
to
their
deeds
14
And
death
and
the
Grave
were
hurled
into
the
lake
of
fire
This
means
the
second
death
the
lake
of
fire
15
Furthermore
whoever
was
not
found
written
in
the
book
of
life
was
hurled
into
the
lake
of
fire
1
And
I
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
former
heaven
and
the
former
earth
had
passed
away
and
the
sea
is
no
more
2
I
also
saw
the
holy
city
New
Jerusalem
coming
down
out
of
heaven
from
God
and
prepared
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
3
With
that
I
heard
a
loud
voice
from
the
throne
say
Look
The
tent
of
God
is
with
mankind
and
he
will
reside
with
them
and
they
will
be
his
people
And
God
himself
will
be
with
them
4
And
he
will
wipe
out
every
tear
from
their
eyes
and
death
will
be
no
more
neither
will
mourning
nor
outcry
nor
pain
be
anymore
The
former
things
have
passed
away
5
And
the
One
seated
on
the
throne
said
Look
I
am
making
all
things
new
Also
he
says
Write
for
these
words
are
faithful
and
true
6
And
he
said
to
me
They
have
come
to
pass
I
am
the
Alpha
and
the
Omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
To
anyone
thirsting
I
will
give
from
the
spring
of
the
water
of
life
free
7
Anyone
conquering
will
inherit
these
things
and
I
will
be
his
God
and
he
will
be
my
son
8
But
as
for
the
cowards
and
those
without
faith
and
those
who
are
disgusting
in
their
filth
and
murderers
and
the
sexually
immoral
and
those
practicing
spiritism
and
idolaters
and
all
the
liars
their
portion
will
be
in
the
lake
that
burns
with
fire
and
sulfur
This
means
the
second
death
9
One
of
the
seven
angels
who
had
the
seven
bowls
that
were
full
of
the
seven
last
plagues
came
and
said
to
me
Come
and
I
will
show
you
the
bride
the
Lambs
wife
10
So
he
carried
me
away
in
the
power
of
the
spirit
to
a
great
and
lofty
mountain
and
he
showed
me
the
holy
city
Jerusalem
coming
down
out
of
heaven
from
God
11
and
having
the
glory
of
God
Its
radiance
was
like
a
most
precious
stone
like
a
jasper
stone
shining
crystal
clear
12
It
had
a
great
and
lofty
wall
and
had
12
gates
with
12
angels
at
the
gates
and
on
the
gates
were
inscribed
the
names
of
the
12
tribes
of
the
sons
of
Israel
13
On
the
east
were
three
gates
and
on
the
north
three
gates
and
on
the
south
three
gates
and
on
the
west
three
gates
14
The
wall
of
the
city
also
had
12
foundation
stones
and
on
them
were
the
12
names
of
the
12
apostles
of
the
Lamb
15
Now
the
one
who
was
speaking
with
me
was
holding
a
golden
reed
as
a
measure
in
order
to
measure
the
city
and
its
gates
and
its
wall
16
And
the
city
is
laid
out
as
a
square
and
its
length
is
as
great
as
its
width
And
he
measured
the
city
with
the
reed
12000
stadia
its
length
and
width
and
height
are
equal
17
He
also
measured
its
wall
144
cubits
according
to
a
mans
measure
at
the
same
time
an
angels
measure
18
Now
the
wall
was
made
of
jasper
and
the
city
was
pure
gold
like
clear
glass
19
The
foundations
of
the
city
wall
were
adorned
with
every
sort
of
precious
stone
the
first
foundation
was
jasper
the
second
sapphire
the
third
chalcedony
the
fourth
emerald
20
the
fifth
sardonyx
the
sixth
sardius
the
seventh
chrysolite
the
eighth
beryl
the
ninth
topaz
the
tenth
chrysoprase
the
eleventh
hyacinth
the
twelfth
amethyst
21
Also
the
12
gates
were
12
pearls
each
one
of
the
gates
was
made
of
one
pearl
And
the
main
street
of
the
city
was
pure
gold
like
transparent
glass
22
I
did
not
see
a
temple
in
it
for
Jehovah
God
the
Almighty
is
its
temple
also
the
Lamb
is
23
And
the
city
has
no
need
of
the
sun
nor
of
the
moon
to
shine
on
it
for
the
glory
of
God
illuminated
it
and
its
lamp
was
the
Lamb
24
And
the
nations
will
walk
by
means
of
its
light
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
will
bring
their
glory
into
it
25
Its
gates
will
not
be
closed
at
all
by
day
for
night
will
not
exist
there
26
And
they
will
bring
the
glory
and
the
honor
of
the
nations
into
it
27
But
anything
defiled
and
anyone
who
does
what
is
disgusting
and
deceitful
will
in
no
way
enter
into
it
only
those
written
in
the
Lambs
scroll
of
life
will
enter
1
And
he
showed
me
a
river
of
water
of
life
clear
as
crystal
flowing
out
from
the
throne
of
God
and
of
the
Lamb
2
down
the
middle
of
its
main
street
On
both
sides
of
the
river
were
trees
of
life
producing
12
crops
of
fruit
yielding
their
fruit
each
month
And
the
leaves
of
the
trees
were
for
the
healing
of
the
nations
3
And
there
will
no
longer
be
any
curse
But
the
throne
of
God
and
of
the
Lamb
will
be
in
the
city
and
his
slaves
will
offer
him
sacred
service
4
and
they
will
see
his
face
and
his
name
will
be
on
their
foreheads
5
Also
night
will
be
no
more
and
they
have
no
need
of
lamplight
or
sunlight
for
Jehovah
God
will
shed
light
upon
them
and
they
will
rule
as
kings
forever
and
ever
6
He
said
to
me
These
words
are
faithful
and
true
yes
Jehovah
the
God
who
inspired
the
prophets
has
sent
his
angel
to
show
his
slaves
the
things
that
must
shortly
take
place
7
Look
I
am
coming
quickly
Happy
is
anyone
observing
the
words
of
the
prophecy
of
this
scroll
8
Well
I
John
was
the
one
hearing
and
seeing
these
things
When
I
heard
and
saw
them
I
fell
down
to
worship
at
the
feet
of
the
angel
who
had
been
showing
me
these
things
9
But
he
tells
me
Be
careful
Do
not
do
that
I
am
only
a
fellow
slave
of
you
and
of
your
brothers
the
prophets
and
of
those
observing
the
words
of
this
scroll
Worship
God
10
He
also
tells
me
Do
not
seal
up
the
words
of
the
prophecy
of
this
scroll
for
the
appointed
time
is
near
11
Let
the
one
who
is
unrighteous
continue
in
unrighteousness
and
let
the
filthy
one
continue
in
his
filth
but
let
the
righteous
one
continue
in
righteousness
and
let
the
holy
one
continue
in
holiness
12
Look
I
am
coming
quickly
and
the
reward
I
give
is
with
me
to
repay
each
one
according
to
his
work
13
I
am
the
Alpha
and
the
Omega
the
first
and
the
last
the
beginning
and
the
end
14
Happy
are
those
who
wash
their
robes
so
that
they
may
have
authority
to
go
to
the
trees
of
life
and
that
they
may
gain
entrance
into
the
city
through
its
gates
15
Outside
are
the
dogs
and
those
who
practice
spiritism
and
those
who
are
sexually
immoral
and
the
murderers
and
the
idolaters
and
everyone
who
loves
and
practices
lying
16
I
Jesus
sent
my
angel
to
bear
witness
to
you
about
these
things
for
the
congregations
I
am
the
root
and
the
offspring
of
David
and
the
bright
morning
star
17
And
the
spirit
and
the
bride
keep
on
saying
Come
and
let
anyone
hearing
say
Come
and
let
anyone
thirsting
come
let
anyone
who
wishes
take
lifes
water
free
18
I
am
bearing
witness
to
everyone
who
hears
the
words
of
the
prophecy
of
this
scroll
If
anyone
makes
an
addition
to
these
things
God
will
add
to
him
the
plagues
that
are
written
in
this
scroll
19
and
if
anyone
takes
anything
away
from
the
words
of
the
scroll
of
this
prophecy
God
will
take
his
portion
away
from
the
trees
of
life
and
out
of
the
holy
city
things
that
are
written
about
in
this
scroll
20
The
one
who
bears
witness
of
these
things
says
Yes
I
am
coming
quickly
Amen
Come
Lord
Jesus
21
May
the
undeserved
kindness
of
the
Lord
Jesus
be
with
the
holy
ones
